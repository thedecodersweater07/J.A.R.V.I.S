Kolodub was born in Vinnytsia on 1 January 1930,[2] into a family of musicians.[3] She composed her first work at age five.[1]: 27 She studied violin and piano at Kyiv's Gliere School of Music, graduating in 1949.

Vocal compositions include choral music, musicals, songs and film scores.[1]: 28 [5] Her work has been described as of "fearless emotionalism and melodic clarity".[1]: 27 A reviewer of a recording of her Concertino for oboe and piano noted: "Beginning and ending in a pastoral mood –although at the end the music is more "knowing", more mature, because of what has happened in the middle – it contains a section of more animated and angular music. The composer never looses sight of how to communicate with her audience and this is a most satisfactory work".[8] Many of her works were published, some in the United States,[1]: 30 Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany.[5]
