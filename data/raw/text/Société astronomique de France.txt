 The Société astronomique de France (SAF; French: [sɔsjete astʁɔnɔmik də fʁɑ̃s]), the French astronomical society, is a non-profit association in the public interest organized under French law (Association loi de 1901). Founded by astronomer Camille Flammarion in 1887, its purpose is to promote the development and practice of astronomy.[1] SAF was established by Camille Flammarion and a group of 11 persons on 28 January 1887 in Flammarion's apartment at 16 rue Cassini, 75014 Paris, close to the Paris Observatory.[2][3] Open to all, SAF includes both professional and amateur astronomers as members, from France and abroad.[4] Its objective was defined at the time of its establishment as: "A Society is founded with the aim of bringing together people engaged practically or theoretically in Astronomy, or who are interested in the development of this Science and the extension of its influence for the illumination of minds. Its efforts shall support the advancement and popularization of this Science, as well as facilitating ways and means for those who wish to undertake astronomical studies. All friends of Science and Progress are invited for its establishment and development."[5] On 4 April 1887, the headquarters was established at the Hôtel des Sociétés Savantes, 28 rue Serpente, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. The society built an observatory on the top floor of the building for its members' use which operated from 1890 to 1968 (Observatory of the rue Serpente).[6] On 17 October 1966, the headquarters moved to the Maison de la Chimie at 28 rue Saint-Dominique, Paris 75007.[7] Since 1974, the headquarters has been located at 3, rue Beethoven, Paris 75016.[8] The presidents of the Society have included many illustrious persons in astronomy and related fields.[4] The society has offered the following awards over the years to its members and to notable personalities in the field of astronomy in France and abroad. Not all awards are given every year, and some have been discontinued. The Parisian engraver Alphée Dubois (1831–1905) created several medals for the Société Astronomique de France, including the Medal of the Society "la Nuit étoilée" (1887),[19] the Medal of the Prix des Dames (1896), the Medal of the Prix Janssen (1896),[20] and the Society's Commemorative Medal.[21] French astronomer André Patry of the Observatoire de Nice named Asteroid (4162) SAF in the society's honor after he discovered the body on 24 November 1940.[30]
