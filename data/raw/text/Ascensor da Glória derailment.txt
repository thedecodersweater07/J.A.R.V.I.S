  At around 18:05 (WEST) on 3 September 2025, a car of Ascensor da Glória, a funicular connecting Bairro Alto and Restauradores Square in Lisbon, Portugal, derailed and crashed, resulting in 16 deaths[1][2] and 23 injuries. Reports say the car was at the top of the hill when it derailed, and sped uncontrollably downhill before hitting a building near the bottom. An investigation into the incident was launched by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail and Carris, Lisbon's public transport operator. A national day of mourning was declared following the accident. The Ascensor da Glória is one of three street-running funicular routes operating in Lisbon. With a capacity of 43 passengers on each car, it serves the route between Bairro Alto and Restauradores Square.[3][4] The two cars which are attached by a haulage cable rely on electric motors to provide propulsion.[5] The route spans about 265 metres (870 ft) and operates on a ramp. It was designated as a national monument in 2002 and is a popular mode of transport for tourists and locals.[6] The maintenance of Lisbon's funiculars had been outsourced since 2011. The last public tender for maintenance was opened in 2022, to which four companies applied, after which Carris signed a contract with MAIN – Maintenance Engineering,[7] worth one million euros, covering the Bica, Lavra and Santa Justa lifts. According to the Carris workers' union, the company's employees had repeatedly reported poor maintenance work by MAIN.[8] The Ascensor da Glória was last placed under general maintenance, which is held every four years, in 2022. Its most recent immediate maintenance, held every two years, was conducted between 26 August and 30 September 2024.[9][10] A routine daily visual inspection was carried out nine hours before the derailment.[11] A few hours after the 2025 disaster, CEO of Carris Pedro de Brito Bogas [pt] (in office since May 2022[12][13]) stated to the press that the "the maintenance protocol was scrupulously followed" by MAIN and that it included weekly, monthly, and daily inspections.[7][14] An earlier incident occured in May 2018, where one of the cars derailed due to a lack of maintenance of its wheels. No one was injured.[15] The funicular derailment occurred at around 18:05 (WEST), at the start of the evening rush hour.[4] According to the Portuguese-language Luxembourgish newspaper Contacto, the upper car, Car 1[16] crashed into a building and was destroyed.[17] Witnesses said the other carriage ascending from the bottom of the slope initially jolted and struck the pavement. As witnesses attempted to release passengers from the stationary carriage, Car 2,[16] the other carriage from the top of the slope came down uncontrollably before hitting a building[18] at a bend[19] along Calçada da Glória close to Avenida da Liberdade, near the bottom of the line.[20][21] One person on the sidewalk was reported to have been hit by the carriage as it toppled.[22] The second carriage at the foot of the hill did not sustain damage but some of its occupants leapt from the windows when the crash occurred.[5] Footage on social media showed the mangled vehicle lying on its side after the crash, as well as scattered human remains.[4] According to Rádio e Televisão de Portugal, citing local authorities, the railway was carrying more than 40 people at the time of the crash.[23] Portuguese newspaper Observador and the Lisbon fire department said a loose cable caused the vehicle to become uncontrollable and crash into the building.[24][25] Following the crash, 62 rescue personnel and 22 emergency vehicles attended the scene.[26] Video footage of the aftermath of the crash, posted shortly afterwards, showed bystanders running to assist victims.[27] The crash killed 16 people[1][2] and injured 23 others,[22] including five who were in critical condition.[3][29][30] Seven injured were taken to São José Hospital while the rest were treated at the Hospital de Santa Maria and Hospital de São Francisco Xavier [pt].[31] Five Portuguese and eleven foreigners were identified as the fatalities; all were adults.[11][32] The Portuguese fatalities were identified as brakeman André Marques and four staff members of charitable organization Santa Casa da Misericórdia, whose headquarters is located at the hill where the funicular operates.[11] The foreign fatalities were three Britons, two South Koreans, two Canadians, an American, a Ukrainian, a Swiss and a French national.[33] Among the injured, five were Portuguese while the others were foreigners.[22][26][34] A three-year old child was among the injured.[35] Portugal's Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail said it would launch an investigation into the crash.[29] Carris said that apart from the maintenance work in 2024, regular monthly and weekly checks had been done and that it would open its own investigation. It also said it was "very sorry about what happened".[20] All funicular services in the city were suspended by the Lisbon Municipal Chamber which also directed that they be inspected immediately.[19] The Polícia Judiciária announced the creation of a telephone line and an email to be used by families and close friends of the victims as well as official entities for information about the incident.[36] A national day of mourning was observed in Portugal on 4 September while Lisbon observed three days of mourning.[23] A mass in memory of the victims was held at the Igreja de São Domingos in Lisbon on the evening of September 4, and was attended by Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, prime minister Luis Montenegro and Lisbon mayor Carlos Moedas.[11] The European Parliament flew flags at half mast. President Rebelo, the European Commission, and Spain made statements in response to the accident.[37]
