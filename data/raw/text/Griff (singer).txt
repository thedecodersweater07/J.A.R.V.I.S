Griff was born on 21 January 2001 as Sarah Faith Griffiths,[2] in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire.[3] Her father Mark Griffiths is the son of Jamaican immigrants who were part of the "Windrush generation" and her mother Kim is a first-generation migrant whose family moved to England amid the Vietnam War.[4] Griff has stated that she feels "more in touch with my Chinese side".[3] Griff's parents foster children and her experiences with the children were reflected in her single "Good Stuff".[5] Griff stated that her earliest memory of loving music was being given an iPod Shuffle with the Taylor Swift album Fearless (2008) downloaded to it,[6] when she was around the age of eight.[7] She then taught herself to record and produce music on her older brother's laptop and used tutorials on YouTube to inform her on techniques.[3] While attending St Clement Danes School, Griff kept her musical life private, because she didn’t know if she would be successful, stating: "no one likes that person at school who talks about how they want to sing".[3][4] After finishing her A Levels, she told teachers that she was taking a gap year, rather than informing them of her music ventures.[3] On using the stage name Griff, she stated: "Sarah Griffiths isn't that glamorous, I sound like I have a mortgage and 4 kids, it's very corporate".[7] Raised an evangelical Christian, Griff has said of her own faith: "I guess if you grow up with Christian parents, you get to a point where you ask: “Okay, do I actually believe or am I just going through the motions?” And from a young age I felt like it was something I actually do believe and so it’s always been something that I’ve owned."[4] On 4 July 2019, it was announced that Griff had been signed to Warner Records.[8] On the same day, she released her debut single "Mirror Talk", accompanied by a music video. Annie Mac featured the song on BBC Radio 1 under the New Name playlist.[9] She stated that the writing process for the song took an hour.[3] Griff described the release as a career highlight, since it was released immediately after she had finished her A Level exams.[6] Billboard described the song as an "electrifying debut", and praised her "powerful voice and vulnerable lyrics".[8] In August 2019, Griff released her follow-up single, "Didn't Break It Enough",[10] accompanied by a music video in which the clothing worn was made by Griff herself.[11][12] She released the single "Paradise" in October 2019,[13] which was followed by the release of her debut extended play, The Mirror Talk, on 15 November 2019.[14] In December 2019, Griff released a cover of the Bangles' 1989 song "Eternal Flame".[15] On 7 February 2020, Griff released the single "Good Stuff". Despite people thinking the song is about a romantic breakup, she clarified that the subject of the song is about missing children that her family fostered, since they felt like siblings.[16] In March 2020, a song titled "I Love You's", that Griff co-wrote, was released by American singer Hailee Steinfeld.[17] This was followed by "Forgive Myself", a song released by Griff on 29 May 2020,[18] described by NME as an "anthem".[19] In July 2020, Griff was nominated by The Ivors Academy for an Ivor Novello Rising Star Award,[20] and later that month, she released the song "Say It Again".[21] In October 2020, she was part of two collaborative songs; "1,000,000 X Better" with English band Honne,[22] and "Inside Out", a song with German DJ Zedd.[23] In January 2021, she released "Black Hole", which NME described as a "dark pop anthem".[24] On 19 March 2021, Griff won the Brit Award for Rising Star and performed "Black Hole" at the 2021 ceremony.[25] Later that day, she announced details of her debut mixtape, One Foot in Front of the Other, which was released on 18 June 2021.[26] Two months later, Griff followed up the mixtape with single "One Night".[27] In October 2021, she embarked on a tour across the United Kingdom in support of her mixtape.[28] She later did European and North American tour dates.[29] In November 2021, Dua Lipa announced Griff as one of her three supporting acts for the European dates of the Future Nostalgia Tour in 2022.[30] In September 2022, she performed on eight dates of the +–=÷× Tour by Ed Sheeran.[31] In 2023, she also took part in the Music of the Spheres World Tour by British band Coldplay as opening act for a few European dates including Portugal, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[32] In August 2023, after a break from music whilst on the Future Nostalgia Tour, Griff released the single "Vertigo".[33] The song was promoted by Taylor Swift on Instagram, who said she "loved" the song.[34] She released an EP to support the single, Vert1go Vol. 1, in October 2023.[35] Later that month, Griff announced her single "Astronaut", which was written in collaboration with Coldplay lead vocalist Chris Martin and released in December.[36] She released a third single "Miss Me Too" in February 2024, followed by an EP, ver2igo vol.2 in April 2024.[37][38] On 12 July 2024, Griff released her debut album, Vertigo, to generally positive reviews from critics.[39][40] In November 2024, Griff released a new single "Last Night's Mascara".[41] On 20 June 2024, Griff was announced as an opener for Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet Tour.[41][42] On 22 June 2024, Griff opened for Taylor Swift as part of the Eras Tour in London alongside Paramore.[43] Vertigo World Tour
