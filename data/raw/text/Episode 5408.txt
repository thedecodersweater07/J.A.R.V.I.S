 Episode 5408 of the BBC soap opera EastEnders aired on 24 December 2016 at 8:25pm. One of the main plots revolved around the closing of the Walford launderette, which had featured since EastEnders first episodes in 1985, and the forced retirement of its worker Dot Cotton (June Brown). In the episode, Dot is upset when nobody attends the party to mark the launderette's closing. The episode also featured the unannounced guest return of former character Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), whose voice is heard in a tape that Dot finds; the archived recordings of other former characters also are heard in the episode. The episode also started the exit storyline of Linda Carter, whose portrayer Kellie Bright went on maternity leave. Other plots included Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) isolating himself from his family, the final night of the Walford Christmas play and Stacey Slater's (Lacey Turner) turkey being ruined. The episode also featured the debut of Jenna Russell as Michelle Fowler, an original EastEnders character who had departed in 1995. Michelle's original portrayer, Susan Tully, had refused to return, so producer Sean O'Connor decided to recast the role. Critics believed that viewers could be disappointed by the recast and called Dot's storyline emotional, expressing sympathy for the character. The closing of the launderette was described as being the end of an era by critics. Critics also noted how singer George Michael died hours after the episode's broadcast, which featured Heather – who was characterised as being his biggest fan – referencing the singer and his song "Last Christmas". Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) is upset that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), who is unwell with cirrhosis, has walked out on the family. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) talks to Phil and berates him for leaving. The residents of Walford get ready for the final night of the Walford Christmas play. Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) invites Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) to spend Christmas with her family. Dot Cotton (June Brown) prepares for her last day working at the launderette, and her step-granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) helps her to prepare a farewell party to mark the closing, but she does not stay for the party itself as she leaves Walford to spend Christmas with her mother, disappointing Dot. Dot expects many residents to attend the party, but they are unable to due to various factors. Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and her stepmother Sharon have an argument in the café over Sharon letting Phil walk out the previous day. Phil goes to cemetery to put flowers on the grave of his mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), where he bumps into Denise Fox (Diane Parish), who is visiting the grave of Kevin Wicks (Phil Daniels). Denise also berates Phil for walking out on his family and stays with him so that he does not do "something stupid". She later leaves, with Phil unaware that Denise is pregnant with his baby. Whilst clearing out her belongings in the launderette, Dot finds a lost tape recording of Shirley and Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), who had put together a mixtape of Christmas songs as a Christmas present, and Dot becomes emotional listening to it. Heather begins the mixtape with Wham!'s "Last Christmas". As Dot closes the launderette for the final time, she hears the voices of people from her past, including Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Jim Branning (John Bardon). Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) steps out of a taxi, having returned to Walford after leaving in 1995. Backstage at the play, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) finds out that her mother Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman) has had a stroke and she leaves to be with her, desperate to make sure that she is okay. Linda worries about leaving her family, but her husband Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) assures her that she is doing the right thing by going to Elaine. Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) finds a cat eating her Christmas turkey and she angrily throws the food out. Someone is then seen viewing Stacey's social media post asking for an urgent Christmas turkey. Sharon is shocked when Phil returns home. He reveals to Denny that he saw him perform in the play, which is he happy about. Phil apologises to Sharon and gives her an eternity ring. An overwhelmed Sharon goes outside for air and starts crying. Michelle, her best friend, sees her and the pair have an emotional reunion.

also called the coincidence "eerie" and noted how viewers voiced their opinions about the coincidence on Twitter, with some wondering how Heather would have reacted to the news.[17] Sam Warner from Digital Spy wrote that viewers were given "quite the twist" by Heather's surprise return "beyond the grave" in the episode.[10] Warner believed that Shirley and Heather had "thoughtfully" put the mixtape together, but believed that it would not be a "Merry Christmas" for Dot due to nobody attending her goodbye party.[10] Warner also added that Dot was "given a poignant moment" in the episode when she heard the voices of several former characters.[10] Warner's colleague, Daniel Kilkelly, included the episode and Michelle's "shock" recast on his list of EastEnders's "biggest and best moments" of 2016, writing that "producers finally accepted there was no chance of luring back" Tully.[18] A reporter from the Daily Record believed that it was "inevitable" that the "legendary" Michelle would return to the soap opera and speculated that viewers would be disappointed with the recast, though added that Russell would "usher in a new age for the much loved character".[14] The BBC called Michelle's return a "shock" and called her reunion with Sharon "emotional", believing that Michelle is a "welcome sight" for Sharon, who is struggling with Phil's illness.[16] They also called Phil's eternity ring present "touching".[16] Warner's colleague, Daniel Kilkelly, called the return of "iconic" and "legendary" Michelle as "very exciting" and called the scene where she reunites with Sharon as "genuinely heartwarming".[13] He added, "Adding some extra intrigue for EastEnders fans, the reasons for Michelle's return may not be as simple as just wanting to spend time with her family this Christmas".[13] He also wondered why Michelle had returned.[19] Kilkelly also believed that it had been a "lonely few weeks" for Dot, which was "topped off" by nobody attending the Launderette Farewell party.[19] Rachel McGrath from HuffPost noted that Dot's storyline in the episode would not be "cheerful".[7] Kate White from Inside Soap called Dot's party a "modest buffet".[20] She added that it was "heartbreaking" to see Dot so alone, and questioned whether anyone would realise "how much she needs her friends".[20] A writer called the closing of the launderette a "colosssal event" and wondered how the residents would cope, and how the "queen of the machines" Dot would fare without a job.[21]
