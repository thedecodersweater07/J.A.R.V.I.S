the atmosphere of earth consists of a layer of mixed gas that is retained by gravity surrounding the earths surface it contains variable quantities of suspended aerosols and particulates that create weather features such as clouds and hazes the atmosphere serves as a protective buffer between the earths surface and outer space it shields the surface from most meteoroids and ultraviolet solar radiation reduces diurnal temperature variation the temperature extremes between day and night and keeps it warm through heat retention via the greenhouse effect the atmosphere redistributes heat and moisture among different regions via air currents and provides the chemical and climate conditions that allow life to exist and evolve on earth by mole fraction ie by quantity of molecules dry air contains 7808 nitrogen 2095 oxygen 093 argon 004 carbon dioxide and small amounts of other trace gases see composition below for more detail air also contains a variable amount of water vapor on average around 1 at sea level and 04 over the entire atmosphere earths primordial atmosphere consisted of gases accreted from the solar nebula but the composition changed significantly over time affected by many factors such as volcanism outgassing impact events weathering and the evolution of life particularly the photoautotrophs in the present day human activity has contributed to atmospheric changes such as climate change mainly through deforestation and fossilfuelrelated global warming ozone depletion and acid deposition the atmosphere has a mass of about 5151018 kg2 three quarters of which is within about 11 km 68 mi 36000 ft of the surface the atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space the krmn line at 100 km 62 mi is often used as a conventional definition of the edge of space several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere based on characteristics such as temperature and composition namely the troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere formally the ionosphere and exosphere air composition temperature and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and respiration of terrestrial animals is found within the troposphere3 the study of earths atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science aerology and includes multiple subfields such as climatology and atmospheric physics early pioneers in the field include lon teisserenc de bort and richard assmann4 the study of the historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology the three major constituents of earths atmosphere are nitrogen oxygen and argon water vapor accounts for roughly 025 of the atmosphere by mass in the lower atmosphere the concentration of water vapor a greenhouse gas varies significantly from around 10 ppm by mole fraction in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5 by mole fraction in hot humid air masses and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air without water vapor8 8 the remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases9 among which are other greenhouse gases principally carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone besides argon other noble gases neon helium krypton and xenon are also present filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds10 many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample including dust of mineral and organic composition pollen and spores sea spray and volcanic ash11 various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols such as chlorine elemental or in compounds12 fluorine compounds13 and elemental mercury vapor14 sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide so2 may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution1115 the total ppm above adds up to more than 1 million currently 8343 above it due to experimental error notes a in the atmosphere the pressure is low enough for the ideal gas laws to be correct within 1 therefore the mole fraction is very close to the volume fraction16 4 b ppm parts per million by molecular count c the concentration of co2 has been increasing in recent decades as has that of ch4 d water vapor is about 025 by mass over full atmosphere e water vapor varies significantly locally8 the average molecular weight of dry air which can be used to calculate densities or to convert between mole fraction and mass fraction is about 2894617 or 28964185 257 gmol this is decreased when the air is humid up to an altitude of around 100 km 62 mi atmospheric turbulence mixes the component gases so that their relative concentrations remain the same there exists a transition zone from roughly 80 to 120 km 50 to 75 mi where this turbulent mixing gradually yields to molecular diffusion the latter process forms the heterosphere where the relative concentration of lighter gases increase with altitude19 in general air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere however temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions see the temperature section21 because the general pattern of the temperaturealtitude profile or lapse rate is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers this atmospheric stratification divides the earths atmosphere into five main layers with these typical altitude ranges2223 the exosphere is the outermost layer of earths atmosphere though it is so tenuous that some scientists consider it to be part of interplanetary space rather than part of the atmosphere it extends from the thermopause also known as the exobase at the top of the thermosphere to a poorly defined boundary with the solar wind and interplanetary medium the altitude of the exobase varies from about 500 kilometres 310 mi 1600000 ft to about 1000 kilometres 620 mi in times of higher incoming solar radiation27 the upper limit varies depending on the definition various authorities consider it to end at about 10000 kilometres 6200 mi28 or about 190000 kilometres 120000 miabout halfway to the moon where the influence of earths gravity is about the same as radiation pressure from sunlight27 the geocorona visible in the far ultraviolet caused by neutral hydrogen extends to at least 100000 kilometres 62000 mi27 this layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen with limited amounts of helium carbon dioxide and nascent oxygen closer to the exobase29 the atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometres without colliding with one another21 144 thus the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas and the particles constantly escape into space these freemoving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind every second the earth loses about 3 kg of hydrogen 50 g of helium and much smaller amounts of other constituents30 the exosphere is too far above earth for meteorological phenomena to be possible the exosphere contains many of the artificial satellites that orbit earth31 the thermosphere is the secondhighest layer of earths atmosphere it extends from the mesopause which separates it from the mesosphere at an altitude of about 80 km 50 mi up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 5001000 km 310620 mi the height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity25 the passage of the dusk and dawn solar terminator creates background density perturbations up to a factor of two through this layer forming a dominant feature in this region32 because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere it is also referred to as the exobase overlapping the thermosphere from 50 to 600 kilometres 31 to 373 mi above earths surface is the ionosphere a region of enhanced plasma density3334 the temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height and can rise as high as 1500 c 2700 f though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful this temperature increase is caused by absorption of ionizing uv and xray emission from the sun3435 the air is so rarefied that an individual molecule of oxygen for example travels an average of 1 kilometre 062 mi 3300 ft between collisions with other molecules36 although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin34 this layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor however nonhydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere at an altitude of around 100 km 62 mi37 the colors of the aurora are linked to the properties of the atmosphere at the altitude they occur the most common is the green aurora which comes from atomic oxygen in the 1s state and occurs at altitudes from 120 to 400 km 75 to 250 mi38 the international space station orbits in the thermosphere between 370 and 460 km 230 and 290 mi39 it is this layer where many of the satellites orbiting the earth are present31 the mesosphere is the third highest layer of earths atmosphere occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere it extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km 31 mi to the mesopause at 8085 km 5053 mi above sea level34 temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere it is the coldest place on earth and has an average temperature around 85 c 120 f 190 k4041 because the atmosphere absorbs sound waves at a rate that is proportional to the square of the frequency audible sounds from the ground do not reach the mesosphere infrasonic waves can reach this altitude but they are difficult to emit at a high power level42 just below the mesopause the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can condense into polarmesospheric noctilucent clouds of ice particles these are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or similarly before sunrise they are most readily visible when the sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon43 lightninginduced discharges known as transient luminous events tles occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds44 the mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors and satellites burn up upon atmospheric entrance3445 it is too high above earth to be accessible to jetpowered aircraft and balloons and too low to permit orbital spacecraft the mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocketpowered aircraft46 the stratosphere is the secondlowest layer of earths atmosphere it lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause this layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12 km 75 mi above earths surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km 31 to 34 mi22 99 of the total mass of the atmosphere lies below 30 km 19 mi47 and the atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 11000 the pressure at sea level48 it contains the ozone layer which is the part of earths atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas49 the stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude this rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation uv from the sun by the ozone layer which restricts turbulence and mixing although the temperature may be 80 c 110 f 190 k at the tropopause the top of the stratosphere is much warmer and may be just below 0 c5049 this layer is unique to the earth neither mars nor venus have a stratosphere because of low abundances of oxygen in their atmospheres51 the stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions so the stratosphere lacks the weatherproducing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere consequently the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather49 however polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest52 the stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jetpowered aircraft53 the troposphere is the lowest layer of earths atmosphere it extends from earths surface to an average height of about 12 km 75 mi although this altitude varies from about 9 km 56 mi at the geographic poles to 17 km 11 mi at the equator26 with some variation due to weather the troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion ie a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one and in others by a zone that is isothermal with height5455 although variations do occur the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface thus the lowest part of the troposphere ie earths surface is typically the warmest section of the troposphere this promotes vertical mixing hence the origin of its name in the greek word tropos meaning turn56 the troposphere contains roughly 80 of the mass of earths atmosphere57 the troposphere is denser than all its overlying layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be more severely compressed fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 55 km 34 mi of the troposphere47 nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere so it is the layer where most of earths weather takes place the ability of the atmosphere to retain water decreases as the temperature declines so 90 of the water vapor is held in the lower part of the troposphere58 it has basically all the weatherassociated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere59 most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere and it is the only layer accessible by propellerdriven aircraft53 contrails are formed from jet engine water emission at altitudes where the atmospheric temperature is about 53 c 63 f typically around 77 km 48 mi for modern engines60 within the five principal layers above which are largely determined by temperature several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties the average temperature of the atmosphere at earths surface is 14 c 57 f 287 k72 or 15 c 59 f 288 k73 depending on the reference747576 the average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the international standard atmosphere as 101325 pascals 76000 torr 146959 psi 76000 mmhg5 257 this is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres atm total atmospheric mass is 514801018 kg 1134941019 lb78 about 25 less than would be inferred from the average sealevel pressure and earths area of 510072 megahectares5 240 this portion being displaced by earths mountainous terrain atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured thus air pressure varies with location and weather air pressure decreases exponentially with altitude at a rate that depends on the air temperature the rate of decrease is determined by a temperaturedependent parameter called the scale height for each increase in altitude by this height the pressure decreases by a factor of e the base of natural logarithms approximately 2718 for earth this value is typically 55 to 6 km for altitudes up to around 80 km 50 mi79 however the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature molecular composition solar radiation and gravity into account at heights over 100 km the atmosphere is not well mixed so each chemical species has its own scale height at altitudes of 200 to 300 km the combined scale height is 20 to 30 km79 the mass of earths atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows80 by comparison the summit of mount everest is at 8848 m 29029 ft commercial airliners typically cruise between 9 and 12 km 30000 and 38000 ft81 where the lower density and temperature of the air improve fuel economy weather balloons reach about 35 km 115000 ft82 and the highest x15 flight in 1963 reached 1080 km 354300 ft even above the krmn line significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur37 meteors begin to glow in this region34 though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply the various layers of earths ionosphere important to hf radio propagation begin below 100 km and extend beyond 500 km by comparison the international space station typically orbit at 370460 km39 within the flayer of the ionosphere5 271 where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months otherwise orbital decay will occur resulting in a return to earth39 depending on solar activity satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 600800 km83 starting at sea level the temperature decreases with altitude until reaching the stratosphere at around 11 km above the temperature stabilizes over a large vertical distance starting above about 20 km the temperature increases with height due to heating within the ozone layer caused by the capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the sun by the molecular oxygen and ozone gas in this region a second region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes in the aptlynamed thermosphere above 90 km34 during the night the ground radiates more energy than it gains from the atmosphere as energy is conducted from the nearby atmosphere to the cooler ground it creates a temperature inversion where the local temperature increases with altitude up to around 1000 m84 because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on pressure or density the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile see illustration to the right and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure85 for example at sea level the speed of sound is 340 ms at the average temperature of the stratosphere 60c the speed of sound decreases to 290 ms86 the density of air at sea level is about 129 kgm3 129 gl 000129 gcm35 257 density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air a form of the ideal gas law atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases this variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula87 more sophisticated models are used to predict the orbital decay of satellites88 the average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion 51015 tonnes or 11200000 the mass of earth according to the american national center for atmospheric research the total mean mass of the atmosphere is 514801018 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 12 or 151015 kg depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used somewhat smaller than the previous estimate the mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1271016 kg and the dry air mass as 51352 000031018 kg89 solar radiation or sunlight is the energy earth receives from the sun earth also emits radiation back into space but at longer wavelengths that humans cannot see as energy propagates through the atmosphere it is impacted by the process of radiative transfer that is some of the incoming and emitted radiation is subject to absorption emission and scattering by the atmosphere another portion of the incident energy is reflected9091 with the two most important atmospheric reflectors being dust and clouds depending on the properties of the aerosol clouds can reflect up to 70 of the incident radiation globally clouds reflect 20 of the incoming energy contributing two thirds of the planets total albedo92 in may 2017 glints of light seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the troposphere9394 when light passes through earths atmosphere photons interact with it through scattering if the light does not interact with the atmosphere it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the sun indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere for example on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you it has all been scattered as another example due to a phenomenon called rayleigh scattering shorter blue wavelengths scatter more easily than longer red wavelengths this is why the sky looks blue you are seeing scattered blue light this is also why sunsets are red because the sun is close to the horizon the suns rays pass through more atmosphere than normal before reaching your eye much of the blue light has been scattered out leaving the red light in a sunset95 different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation for example o2 and o3 absorb almost all radiation with wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometres96 water h2o absorbs at many wavelengths above 700 nm97 when a molecule absorbs a photon it increases the energy of the molecule this heats the atmosphere but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation as discussed below in astronomical spectroscopy the absorption of specific frequencies by the atmosphere is referred to as telluric contamination98 the combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave windows of low opacity allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light the optical window runs from around 300 nm ultravioletc up into the range humans can see the visible spectrum commonly called light at roughly 400700 nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100 nm there are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths for example the radio window runs from about one centimetre to about elevenmetre waves99 emission is the opposite of absorption it is when an object emits radiation objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their black body emission curves therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation with shorter wavelengths colder objects emit less radiation with longer wavelengths for example the sun is approximately 6000 k 5730 c 10340 f its radiation peaks near 500 nm and is visible to the human eye earth is approximately 290 k 17 c 62 f so its radiation peaks near 10000 nm and is much too long to be visible to humans100 because of its temperature the atmosphere emits infrared radiation for example on clear nights earths surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights this is because clouds h2o are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation101 this is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations the greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation but do not interact in this manner with sunlight in the visible spectrum common examples of these are co2 and h2o102 without greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the average temperature of earths surface would be a frozen 18 c 0 f rather than the present comfortable average of 15 c 59 f103 the refractive index of air is close to but just greater than 1104 systematic variations in the refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths one example is that under some circumstances observers on board ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of earths surface105 the refractive index of air depends on temperature106 giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large an example of such effects is the mirage107 atmospheric circulation is the largescale movement of air through the troposphere and the means with ocean circulation by which heat is distributed around earth the largescale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by earths rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles the axial tilt of the planet means the location of maximum heat is continually changing resulting in seasonal variations the uneven distribution of land and water further breaks up the flow of air108 the flow of air around the planet is divided into three main convection cells by latitude around the equator the hadley cell is driven by the rising flow of air along the equator in the upper atmosphere this air flows toward the poles at mid latitudes this circulation is reversed with ground air flowing toward the poles with the ferrel cell finally in the high latitudes is the polar cell where air again rises and flows toward the poles108 the interface between these cells is responsible for jet streams these are narrow fast moving bands that flow from west to east and typically form at an elevation of around 9100 m 30000 ft jet streams can shift around depending on conditions they are strongest in winter when the boundaries between hot and cold air are the most pronounced109 in the middle latitudes it is instabilities in the jet streams that are responsible for moving weather systems110 as with the oceans the earths atmosphere is subject to waves and tidal forces these are triggered by nonuniform heating by the sun and by the daily solar cycle respectively wavelike behavior can occur on a variety of scales from smaller gravity waves that transfer momentum into the higher atmospheric layers to much larger planetary waves or rossby waves atmospheric tides are periodic oscillations of the troposphere and stratosphere that transport energy to the upper atmosphere111 the first atmosphere during the early earths hadean eon consisted of gases in the solar nebula primarily hydrogen and probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants jupiter and saturn notably water vapor methane and ammonia during this earliest era the moonforming collision and numerous impacts with large meteorites heated the atmosphere driving off the most volatile gases the collision with theia in particular melted and ejected large portions of earths mantle and crust and outgassed significant amounts of steam which eventually cooled and condensed to contribute to ocean water at the end of the hadean112 10 the increasing solidification of earths crust at the end of the hadean closed off most of the advective heat transfer to the surface causing the atmosphere to cool which condensed most of the water vapor out of the air precipitating into a superocean further outgassing from volcanism supplemented by gases introduced by huge asteroids during the late heavy bombardment created the subsequent archean atmosphere which consisted largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide methane and inert gases112 a major part of carbon dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments waterrelated sediments have been found that date from as early as 38 billion years ago113 about 34 billion years ago nitrogen formed the major component of the thenstable second atmosphere the influence of the evolution of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of earliest life forms appeared as early as 35 billion years ago114 how earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life if the early sun put out 30 lower solar radiance than today is a puzzle known as the faint young sun paradox115 the geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 24 billion years ago in the late neoarchean an oxygencontaining atmosphere began to develop apparently due to a billion years of cyanobacterial photosynthesis known as the great oxygenation event116 which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 27 billion years ago the early basic carbon isotopy isotope ratio proportions strongly suggests conditions similar to the current and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago117 ancient sediments in the gabon dating from between about 215 and 208 billion years ago provide a record of earths dynamic oxygenation evolution these fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the lomagundijatuli carbon isotope excursion118 the constant rearrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the longterm evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 24 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event119 and its appearance is indicated by the end of banded iron formations which signals the depletion of substrates that can react with oxygen to produce ferric deposits during the early proterozoic eon120 before this time any oxygen produced by cyanobacterial photosynthesis would be readily removed by the oxidation of reducing substances on the earths surface notably ferrous iron sulfur and atmospheric methane free oxygen molecules did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reductant materials that removed oxygen this point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere121 o2 showed major variations during the proterozoic including a billionyear period of euxinia until reaching a steady state of more than 15 by the end of the precambrian122 the rise of the more robust eukaryotic photoautotrophs green and red algae injected further oxygenation into the air especially after the end of the cryogenian global glaciation which was followed by an evolutionary radiation event during the ediacaran period known as the avalon explosion where complex metazoan life forms including the earliest cnidarians placozoans and bilaterians first proliferated the following time span from 539 million years ago to the present day is the phanerozoic eon during the earliest period of which the cambrian more actively moving metazoan life began to appear and rapidly diversify in another radiation event called the cambrian explosion whose locomotive metabolism was fuelled by the rising oxygen level123 the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years reaching a peak of about 35 around 280 million years ago during the carboniferous period significantly higher than todays 21126 two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere the evolution of plants and their increasing role in carbon fixation and the consumption of oxygen by rapidly diversifying animal faunae and also by plants for photorespiration and their own metabolic needs at night breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere which reacts and hence reduces oxygen in the atmosphere127 however volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide128 which can fuel oxygenic photosynthesis by terrestrial and aquatic plants the cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not precisely understood periods with more oxygen in the atmosphere were often associated with more rapid development of animals119 air pollution is the introduction of airborne chemicals particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms129 the population growth industrialization and motorization of human societies have significantly increased the amount of airborne pollutants in the earths atmosphere causing noticeable problems such as smogs acid rains and pollutionrelated diseases the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer which shields the surface from harmful ionizing ultraviolet radiations is also caused by air pollution chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozonedepleting substances130 since 1750 human activity especially after the industrial revolution has increased the concentrations of various greenhouse gases most importantly carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions coupled with deforestation and destruction of wetlands via logging and land developments have caused an observed rise in global temperatures with the global average surface temperatures being 11 c higher in the 20112020 decade than they were in 1850131 it has raised concerns of manmade climate change which can have significant environmental impacts such as sea level rise ocean acidification glacial retreat which threatens water security increasing extreme weather events and wildfires ecological collapse and mass dying of wildlife132
