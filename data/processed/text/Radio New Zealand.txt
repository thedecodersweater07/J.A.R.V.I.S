of the russian invasion of ukraine wire agency articles were said to have been edited to align with the russian view of events29 the editing was linked to one employee journalist michael hall30 who subsequently resigned31 an rnz audit identified 49 examples of what it called inappropriate editing on various international affairs nearly half of the affected content related to the war in ukraine while others related to china israel and countries in europe and south america32 a stuff reporter interpreted the edits to be broadly from a tankie point of view in which aggression from authoritarian governments with a communist past are supported or downplayed usually as part of opposition to the united states and its allies33 in early august 2023 the independent review found that hall had breached both radio new zealands editorial standards and the companys contract with reuters the review also criticised rnzs management for overreacting to coverage of halls actions and found that

partlocal and partnetworked programming in 1996 the new zealand government sold off all of their commercial stations to a syndicate that included united states radio company clear channel

frequency some stations utilised the am frequency for specialised shows such as local talkback sports talk and local news shows in 1993 the majority of these stations were split in two with the am
