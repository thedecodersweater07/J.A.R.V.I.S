outer space or simply space is the expanse that exists beyond earths atmosphere and between celestial bodies1 it contains ultralow levels of particle densities constituting a nearperfect vacuum2 of predominantly hydrogen and helium plasma permeated by electromagnetic radiation cosmic rays neutrinos magnetic fields and dust the baseline temperature of outer space as set by the background radiation from the big bang is 27 kelvins 270 c 455 f3 the plasma between galaxies is thought to account for about half of the baryonic ordinary matter in the universe having a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a kinetic temperature of millions of kelvins4 local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space most of the remaining massenergy in the observable universe is made up of an unknown form dubbed dark matter and dark energy567 outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above earths surface the krmn line an altitude of 100 km 62 mi above sea level89 is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping certain portions of the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere are sometimes referred to as near space the framework for international space law was established by the outer space treaty which entered into force on 10 october 1967 this treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space despite the drafting of un resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space antisatellite weapons have been tested in earth orbit the concept that the space between the earth and the moon must be a vacuum was first proposed in the 17th century after scientists discovered that air pressure decreased with altitude the immense scale of outer space was grasped in the 20th century when the distance to the andromeda galaxy was first measured humans began the physical exploration of space later in the same century with the advent of highaltitude balloon flights this was followed by crewed rocket flights and then crewed earth orbit first achieved by yuri gagarin of the soviet union in 1961 the economic cost of putting objects including humans into space is very high limiting human spaceflight to low earth orbit and the moon on the other hand uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the solar system outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation microgravity has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss the use of the short version space as meaning the region beyond earths sky predates the use of full term outer space with the earliest recorded use of this meaning in an epic poem by john milton called paradise lost published in 16671011 the term outward space existed in a poem from 1842 by the english poet lady emmeline stuartwortley called the maiden of moscow12 but in astronomy the term outer space found its application for the first time in 1845 by alexander von humboldt13 the term was eventually popularized through the writings of h g wells after 190114 theodore von krmn used the term of free space to name the space of altitudes above earth where spacecrafts reach conditions sufficiently free from atmospheric drag differentiating it from airspace identifying a legal space above territories free from the sovereign jurisdiction of countries this definition of the boundary to outer space became known as the krmn line15 spaceborne denotes existing in outer space especially if carried by a spacecraft1617 similarly spacebased means based in outer space or on a planet or moon18 the size of the whole universe is unknown and it might be infinite in extent19 according to the big bang theory the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 138 billion years ago20 which rapidly expanded about 380000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogenthe socalled recombination epoch when this happened matter and energy became decoupled allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space21 matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars galaxies and other astronomical objects leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space22 as light has a finite velocity this theory constrains the size of the directly observable universe21 the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is flat meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe except for local gravity23 the flat universe combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating expansion of the universe indicates that space has a nonzero vacuum energy which is called dark energy24 estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of 59 protons per cubic meter including dark energy dark matter and baryonic matter ordinary matter composed of atoms the atoms account for only 46 of the total energy density or a density of one proton per four cubic meters25 the density of the universe is clearly not uniform it ranges from relatively high density in galaxiesincluding very high density in structures within galaxies such as planets stars and black holesto conditions in vast voids that have much lower density at least in terms of visible matter26 unlike matter and dark matter dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies although dark energy may account for a majority of the massenergy in the universe dark energys influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way27 outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum it has effectively no friction allowing stars planets and moons to move freely along their orbits the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter29 by comparison the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter3031 the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km or 10 billion light years32 in spite of this extinction which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy33 stars planets and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space34 the earths atmospheric pressure drops to about 0032 pa at 100 kilometres 62 miles of altitude35 compared to 100000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac definition of standard pressure above this altitude isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure temperature and composition and varies greatly due to space weather36 the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas37 as it is on earth the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium3839 all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background40 the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about 27 k 270 c 455 f41 the gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely for example the temperature in the boomerang nebula is 1 k 272 c 458 f42 while the solar corona reaches temperatures over 12000002600000 k 22000004700000 f43 magnetic fields have been detected in the space around many classes of celestial objects star formation in spiral galaxies can generate smallscale dynamos creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 510 g the davisgreenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxys magnetic field resulting in weak optical polarization this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields that exist in several nearby galaxies magnetohydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes nonthermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant highz sources indicating the presence of magnetic fields44 outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about 106 ev up to an extreme 1020 ev of ultrahighenergy cosmic rays45 the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 ev with approximately 87 protons 12 helium nuclei and 1 heavier nuclei in the high energy range the flux of electrons is only about 1 of that of protons46 cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers47 scents retained from low earth orbit when returning from extravehicular activity have a burned metallic odor similar to the scent of arc welding fumes this results from oxygen in low earth orbit which clings to suits and equipment484950 other regions of space could have very different odors like that of different alcohols in molecular clouds51 despite the harsh environment several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 200752 seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 15 years53 a strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low earth orbit or a simulated martian environment54 the lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from lifeharboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system with potentially microorganismbearing rocks being exchanged between venus earth and mars55 the lack of pressure in space is the most immediate dangerous characteristic of space to humans pressure decreases above earth reaching a level at an altitude of around 1914 km 1189 mi that matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body this pressure level is called the armstrong line named after american physician harry g armstrong56 at or above the armstrong line fluids in the throat and lungs boil away more specifically exposed bodily liquids such as saliva tears and liquids in the lungs boil away hence at this altitude human survival requires a pressure suit or a pressurized capsule57 out in space sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure such as during a rapid decompression can cause pulmonary barotraumaa rupture of the lungs due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest58 even if the subjects airway is fully open the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture59 rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia60 as a consequence of rapid decompression oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes61 blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 63 kilopascals 1 psi and this condition is called ebullism62 the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels so some blood remains liquid6364 swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit the crew altitude protection suit caps a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kilopascals 03 psi65 supplemental oxygen is needed at 8 km 5 mi to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss while above 20 km 12 mi pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism66 most space suits use around 3039 kilopascals 46 psi of pure oxygen about the same as the partial pressure of oxygen at the earths surface this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed67 humans evolved for life in earth gravity and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health initially more than 50 of astronauts experience space motion sickness this can cause nausea and vomiting vertigo headaches lethargy and overall malaise the duration of space sickness varies but it typically lasts for 13 days after which the body adjusts to the new environment longerterm exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton or spaceflight osteopenia these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise68 other effects include fluid redistribution slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass nasal congestion sleep disturbance and puffiness of the face69 during longduration space travel radiation can pose an acute health hazard exposure to highenergy ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue nausea vomiting as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count over longer durations symptoms include an increased risk of cancer plus damage to the eyes nervous system lungs and the gastrointestinal tract70 on a roundtrip mars mission lasting three years a large fraction of the cells in an astronauts body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei71 the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures72 the transition between earths atmosphere and outer space lacks a welldefined physical boundary with the air pressure steadily decreasing with altitude until it mixes with the solar wind various definitions for a practical boundary have been proposed ranging from 30 km 19 mi out to 1600000 km 990000 mi15 in 2009 measurements of the direction and speed of ions in the atmosphere were made from a sounding rocket the altitude of 118 km 733 mi above earth was the midpoint for charged particles transitioning from the gentle winds of the earths atmosphere to the more extreme flows of outer space the latter can reach velocities well over 268 ms 880 fts7374 highaltitude aircraft such as highaltitude balloons have reached altitudes above earth of up to 50 km75 up until 2021 the united states designated people who travel above an altitude of 50 mi 80 km as astronauts76 astronaut wings are now only awarded to spacecraft crew members that demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety or contributed to human space flight safety77 the region between airspace and outer space is termed near space there is no legal definition for this extent but typically this is the altitude range from 20 to 100 km 12 to 62 mi78 for safety reasons commercial aircraft are typically limited to altitudes of 12 km 75 mi and air navigation services only extend to 18 to 20 km 11 to 12 mi78 the upper limit of the range is the krmn line where astrodynamics must take over from aerodynamics in order to achieve flight79 this range includes the stratosphere mesosphere and lower thermosphere layers of the earths atmosphere80 larger ranges for near space are used by some authors such as 18 to 160 km 11 to 99 mi81 these extend to the altitudes where orbital flight in very low earth orbits becomes practical81 spacecraft have entered into a highly elliptical orbit with a perigee as low as 80 to 90 km 50 to 56 mi surviving for multiple orbits82 at an altitude of 120 km 75 mi82 descending spacecraft begin atmospheric entry as atmospheric drag becomes noticeable for spaceplanes such as nasas space shuttle this begins the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces83 the krmn line established by the fdration aronautique internationale and used internationally by the united nations15 is set at an altitude of 100 km 62 mi as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics this line is named after theodore von krmn who argued for an altitude where a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself89 which he calculated to be at an altitude of about 838 km 521 mi75 this distinguishes altitudes below as the region of aerodynamics and airspace and above as the space of astronautics and free space15 there is no internationally recognized legal altitude limit on national airspace although the krmn line is the most frequently used for this purpose objections have been made to setting this limit too high as it could inhibit space activities due to concerns about airspace violations82 it has been argued for setting no specified singular altitude in international law instead applying different limits depending on the case in particular based on the craft and its purpose increased commercial and military suborbital spaceflight has raised the issue of where to apply laws of airspace and outer space8179 spacecraft have flown over foreign countries as low as 30 km 19 mi as in the example of the space shuttle75 the outer space treaty provides the basic framework for international space law it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty calling outer space the province of all mankind this status as a common heritage of mankind has been used though not without opposition to enforce the right to access and shared use of outer space for all nations equally particularly nonspacefaring nations84 it prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space the treaty was passed by the united nations general assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the union of soviet socialist republics ussr the united states of america usa and the united kingdom uk as of 2017 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty an additional 25 states signed the treaty without ratifying it8586 since 1958 outer space has been the subject of multiple united nations resolutions of these more than 50 have been concerning the international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space87 four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the uns committee on the peaceful uses of outer space still there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space and antisatellite weapons have been successfully tested by the usa ussr china88 and in 2019 india89 the 1979 moon treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies including the orbits around such bodies over to the international community the treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices human spaceflight90 in 1976 eight equatorial states ecuador colombia brazil the republic of the congo zaire uganda kenya and indonesia met in bogot colombia with their declaration of the first meeting of equatorial countries or the bogot declaration they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country91 these claims are not internationally accepted92 an increasing issue of international space law and regulation has been the dangers of the growing number of space debris93 when a rocket is launched to achieve orbit its thrust must both counter gravity and accelerate it to orbital speed after the rocket terminates its thrust it follows an arclike trajectory back toward the ground under the influence of the earths gravitational force in a closed orbit this arc will turn into an elliptical loop around the planet that is a spacecraft successfully enters earth orbit when its acceleration due to gravity pulls the craft down just enough to prevent its momentum from carrying it off into outer space94 for a low earth orbit orbital speed is about 78 kms 17400 mph95 by contrast the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was 22 kms 4900 mph in 1967 by the north american x1596 the upper limit of orbital speed at 112 kms 25100 mph is the velocity required to pull free from earth altogether and enter into a heliocentric orbit97 the energy required to reach earth orbital speed at an altitude of 600 km 370 mi is about 36 mjkg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude98 very low earth orbit vleo has been defined as orbits that have a mean altitude below 450 km 280 mi which can be better suited for earth observation with small satellites99 low earth orbits in general range in altitude from 180 to 2000 km 110 to 1240 mi and are used for scientific satellites medium earth orbits extends from 2000 to 35780 km 1240 to 22230 mi which are favorable orbits for navigation and specialized satellites above 35780 km 22230 mi are the high earth orbits used for weather and some communication satellites100 spacecraft in orbit with a perigee below about 2000 km 1200 mi low earth orbit are subject to drag from the earths atmosphere101 which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellites crosssectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere which is significantly effected by space weather102 at altitudes above 800 km 500 mi orbital lifetime is measured in centuries103 below about 300 km 190 mi decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to 180 km 110 mi it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere104 radiation in orbit around earth is concentrated in van allen radiation belts which trap solar and galactic radiation radiation is a threat to astronauts and space systems it is difficult to shield against and space weather makes the radiation environment variable the radiation belts are equatorial toroidal regions which are bent towards earths poles with the south atlantic anomaly being the region where charged particles approach earth closest105106 the innermost radiation belt the inner van allen belt has its intensity peak at altitudes above the equator of half an earth radius107 centered at about 3000 km108 increasing from the upper edge of low earth orbit which it overlaps109110111 the outermost layer of the earths atmosphere is termed the exosphere it extends outward from the thermopause which lies at an altitude that varies from 250 to 500 kilometres 160 to 310 mi depending on the incidence of solar radiation beyond this altitude collisions between molecules are negligible and the atmosphere joins with interplanetary space112 the region in proximity to the earth is home to a multitude of earthorbiting satellites and has been subject to extensive studies for identification purposes this volume is divided into overlapping regions of space113114115116 nearearth space is the region of space extending from low earth orbits out to geostationary orbits113 this region includes the major orbits for artificial satellites and is the site of most of humanitys space activity the region has seen high levels of space debris sometimes dubbed space pollution threatening nearby space activity113 some of this debris reenters earths atmosphere periodically117 although it meets the definition of outer space the atmospheric density inside lowearth orbital space the first few hundred kilometers above the krmn line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites104 geospace is a region of space that includes earths upper atmosphere and magnetosphere114 the van allen radiation belts lie within the geospace the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause which forms an interface between the earths magnetosphere and the solar wind the inner boundary is the ionosphere119120 the variable spaceweather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysicsthe study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system121 the dayside magnetopause is compressed by solarwind pressurethe subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii on the night side the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100200 earth radii122123 for roughly four days of each month the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail124 geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities the motions of which are controlled by the earths magnetic field these plasmas form a medium from which stormlike disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earths upper atmosphere geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace the radiation belts and the ionosphere these storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics interfering with shortwave radio communication and gps location and timing125 magnetic storms can be a hazard to astronauts even in low earth orbit they create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles126 xgeo space is a concept used by the usa to refer to the space of high earth orbits with the x being some multiple of geosynchronous orbit geo at approximately 35786 km 22236 mi115 hence the l2 earthmoon lagrange point at 448900 km 278934 mi is approximately 1067 xgeo127 translunar space is the region of lunar transfer orbits between the moon and earth128 cislunar space is a region outside of earth that includes lunar orbits the moons orbital space around earth and the earthmoon lagrange points116 the region where a bodys gravitational potential remains dominant against gravitational potentials from other bodies is the bodys sphere of influence or gravity well mostly described with the hill sphere model129 in the case of earth this includes all space from the earth to a distance of roughly 1 of the mean distance from earth to the sun130 or 15 million km 093 million mi beyond earths hill sphere extends along earths orbital path its orbital and coorbital space this space is copopulated by groups of coorbital nearearth objects neos such as horseshoe librators and earth trojans with some neos at times becoming temporary satellites and quasimoons to earth131 deep space is defined by the united states government as all of outer space which lies further from earth than a typical lowearthorbit thus assigning the moon to deepspace132 other definitions vary the starting point of deepspace from that which lies beyond the orbit of the moon to that which lies beyond the farthest reaches of the solar system itself133134135 the international telecommunication union responsible for radio communication including with satellites defines deepspace as distances from the earth equal to or greater than 2 million km 12 million mi136 which is about five times the moons orbital distance but which distance is also far less than the distance between earth and any adjacent planet137 interplanetary space within the solar system is dominated by the gravitation of the sun outside the gravitational spheres of influence of the planets138 interplanetary space extends well beyond the orbit of the outermost planet neptune all the way out to where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the sun and its solar wind producing the heliopause at 110 to 160 au139 the heliopause deflects away lowenergy galactic cosmic rays and its distance and strength varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind140141 the solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun which creates a very tenuous atmosphere the heliosphere for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of 510 protonscm3 and is moving at a velocity of 350400 kms 780000890000 mph142 the region of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth this space is not completely empty but is sparsely filled with cosmic rays which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there is gas plasma and dust143 small meteors and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy144 collectively this matter is termed the interplanetary medium139 a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light145 interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun142 there are magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter saturn mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape with the long tail extending outward behind the planet these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts planets without magnetic fields such as mars have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind146 interstellar space is the physical space outside of the bubbles of plasma known as astrospheres formed by stellar winds originating from individual stars147 it is the space between the stars or stellar systems within a nebula or galaxy148 interstellar space contains an interstellar medium of sparse matter and radiation the boundary between an astrosphere and interstellar space is known as an astropause for the sun the astrosphere and astropause are called the heliosphere and heliopause respectively149 approximately 70 of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms most of the remainder consists of helium atoms this is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis these atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula150 the cataclysmic explosion of a supernova propagates shock waves of stellar ejecta outward distributing it throughout the interstellar medium including the heavy elements previously formed within the stars core151 the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably the average is around 106 particles per m3152 but cold molecular clouds can hold 1081012 per m338150 a number of molecules exist in interstellar space which can form dust particles as tiny as 01 m153 the tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur including the formation of organic polyatomic species much of this chemistry is driven by collisions energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium resulting for example in the trihydrogen cation an ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions154 the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 pc of the sun which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble which is characterized by a lack of dense cold clouds it forms a cavity in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders such as those in the constellations of ophiuchus and taurus the actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more this volume contains about 104105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7000 k and radii of 055 pc155 when stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium for decades it was assumed that the sun had a bow shock in 2012 data from interstellar boundary explorer ibex and nasas voyager probes showed that the suns bow shock does not exist instead these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium156157 a bow shock is a third boundary characteristic of an astrosphere lying outside the termination shock and the astropause157 intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies studies of the largescale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foamlike structure with groups and clusters of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space the remainder forms cosmic voids that are mostly empty of galaxies typically a void spans a distance of 730 megaparsecs158 surrounding and stretching between galaxies is the intergalactic medium igm this rarefied plasma159 is organized in a galactic filamentary structure160 the diffuse photoionized gas contains filaments of higher density about one atom per cubic meter161 which is 5200 times the average density of the universe162 the igm is inferred to be mostly primordial in composition with 76 hydrogen by mass and enriched with higher mass elements from highvelocity galactic outflows163 as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids it heats up to temperatures of 105 k to 107 k4 at these temperatures it is called the warmhot intergalactic medium whim although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards 105 k is often called warm in astrophysics computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warmhot rarefied state162164165 when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments it can heat up even more reaching temperatures of 108 k and above in the socalled intracluster medium icm166 in 350 bce greek philosopher aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum a principle that became known as the horror vacui this concept built upon a 5thcentury bce ontological argument by the greek philosopher parmenides who denied the possible existence of a void in space167 based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist in the west it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty168 as late as the 17th century the french philosopher ren descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled169 in ancient china the 2ndcentury astronomer zhang heng became convinced that space must be infinite extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the sun and the stars the surviving books of the hsan yeh school said that the heavens were boundless empty and void of substance likewise the sun moon and the company of stars float in the empty space moving or standing still170 the italian scientist galileo galilei knew that air has mass and so was subject to gravity in 1640 he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum it would remain for his pupil evangelista torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643 this experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in europe torricelli suggested that since air has weight then air pressure should decrease with altitude171 the french mathematician blaise pascal proposed an experiment to test this hypothesis172 in 1648 his brotherinlaw florin prier repeated the experiment on the puy de dme mountain in central france and found that the column was shorter by three inches this decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a halffull balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand then contract upon descent173 in 1650 german scientist otto von guericke constructed the first vacuum pump a device that would further refute the principle of horror vacui he correctly noted that the atmosphere of the earth surrounds the planet like a shell with the density gradually declining with altitude he concluded that there must be a vacuum between the earth and the moon174 in the 15th century german theologian nicolaus cusanus speculated that the universe lacked a center and a circumference he believed that the universe while not infinite could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained175 these ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the italian philosopher giordano bruno in the 16th century he extended the copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies176 english philosopher william gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void177 this concept of an aether originated with ancient greek philosophers including aristotle who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move178 the concept of a universe filled with a luminiferous aether retained support among some scientists until the early 20th century this form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate179 in 1887 the michelsonmorley experiment tried to detect the earths motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planets motion the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept the idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned it was replaced by albert einsteins theory of special relativity which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant independent of the observers motion or frame of reference180181 the first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite universe was the englishman thomas digges in 1576182 but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the german astronomer friedrich bessel he showed that the star system 61 cygni had a parallax of just 031 arcseconds compared to the modern value of 0287 this corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years183 in 1917 heber curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae suggesting that the former are 100 times further away184 the distance to the andromeda galaxy was determined in 1923 by american astronomer edwin hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy a new technique discovered by henrietta leavitt185 this established that the andromeda galaxy and by extension all galaxies lay well outside the milky way186 with this hubble formulated the hubble constant which allowed for the first time a calculation of the age of the universe and size of the observable universe starting at 2 billion years and 280 million lightyears this became increasingly precise with better measurements until 2006 when data of the hubble space telescope allowed a very accurate calculation of the age of the universe and size of the observable universe187 the modern concept of outer space is based on the big bang cosmology first proposed in 1931 by the belgian physicist georges lematre188 this theory holds that the universe originated from a state of extreme energy density that has since undergone continuous expansion189 the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles guillaume in 1896 using the estimated radiation of the background stars he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 56 k british physicist arthur eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 318 k in 1926 german physicist erich regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 28 k in 1933190 american physicists ralph alpher and robert herman predicted 5 k for the temperature of space in 1948 based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the thennew big bang theory190 for most of human history space was explored by observations made from the earths surfaceinitially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope before reliable rocket technology the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through balloon flights in 1935 the american explorer ii crewed balloon flight reached an altitude of 22 km 14 mi192 this was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the german a4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about 80 km 50 mi in 1957 the uncrewed satellite sputnik 1 was launched by a russian r7 rocket achieving earth orbit at an altitude of 215939 kilometres 134583 mi193 this was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961 when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok 1 the first humans to escape low earth orbit were frank borman jim lovell and william anders in 1968 on board the american apollo 8 which achieved lunar orbit194 and reached a maximum distance of 377349 km 234474 mi from the earth195 the first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the soviet luna 1 which performed a flyby of the moon in 1959196 in 1961 venera 1 became the first planetary probe it revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first flyby of venus although contact was lost before reaching venus the first successful planetary mission was the 1962 flyby of venus by mariner 2197 the first flyby of mars was by mariner 4 in 1964 since that time uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar systems planets as well their moons and many minor planets and comets they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space as well as for observation of the earth198 in august 2012 voyager 1 became the first manmade object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space199 outer space has become an important element of global society it provides multiple applications that are beneficial to the economy and scientific research the placing of artificial satellites in earth orbit has produced numerous benefits and has become the dominating sector of the space economy they allow relay of longrange communications like television provide a means of precise navigation and permit direct monitoring of weather conditions and remote sensing of the earth the latter role serves a variety of purposes including tracking soil moisture for agriculture prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs detection of diseases in plants and trees and surveillance of military activities200 they facilitate the discovery and monitoring of climate change influences201 satellites make use of the significantly reduced drag in space to stay in stable orbits allowing them to efficiently span the whole globe compared to for example stratospheric balloons or highaltitude platform stations which have other benefits202 the absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum this is evidenced by the pictures sent back by the hubble space telescope allowing light from more than 13 billion years agoalmost to the time of the big bangto be observed203 not every location in space is ideal for a telescope the interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse nearinfrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness204 likewise a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers earthbased observations205 the deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces207 like asteroid mining space manufacturing would require a large financial investment with little prospect of immediate return208 an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit 900031000 per kg according to a 2006 estimate allowing for inflation since then209 the cost of access to space has declined since 2013 partially reusable rockets such as the falcon 9 have lowered access to space below 3500 per kg with these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries proposed concepts for addressing this issue include fully reusable launch systems nonrocket spacelaunch momentum exchange tethers and space elevators210 interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility the distances to the nearest stars mean it would require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades for example the daedalus project study which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and helium3 would require 36 years to reach the nearby alpha centauri system other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails ramjets and beampowered propulsion more advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel potentially reaching relativistic velocities211 from the earths surface the ultracold temperature of outer space can be used as a renewable cooling technology for various applications on earth through passive daytime radiative cooling212213 this enhances longwave infrared lwir thermal radiation heat transfer through the atmospheres infrared window into outer space lowering ambient temperatures214215 photonic metamaterials can be used to suppress solar heating216
