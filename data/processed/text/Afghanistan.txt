source from which the grecobactrians and the mughals among others rose to form major empires35 because of the various conquests and periods in both the iranian and indian cultural spheres3637 the area was a center for zoroastrianism buddhism hinduism and later islam38 the modern state of afghanistan began with the durrani afghan empire in the 18th century39 although dost mohammad khan is sometimes considered to be the founder of the first modern afghan state40 afghanistan became a buffer state in the great game between the british empire and the russian empire from india the british attempted to subjugate afghanistan but were repelled in the first angloafghan war the second angloafghan war saw a british victory following the third angloafghan war in 1919 afghanistan became free of foreign political hegemony and emerged as the independent kingdom of afghanistan in 1926 this monarchy lasted almost half a century until zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 following which the republic of afghanistan was established since the late 1970s afghanistans history has been dominated by extensive warfare including coups invasions insurgencies and civil wars the conflict began in 1978 when a communist revolution established a socialist state itself a response to the dictatorship established following a coup dtat in 1973 and subsequent infighting prompted the soviet union to invade afghanistan in 1979 mujahideen fought against the soviets in the sovietafghan war and continued fighting among themselves following the soviets withdrawal in 1989 the taliban controlled most of the country by 1996 but their islamic emirate of afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 us invasion of afghanistan the taliban returned to power in 2021 after capturing kabul ending the 20012021 war as of july 2025update the taliban government is widely unrecognized by the international community due to reported violations of human rights in afghanistan particularly regarding the rights of women in afghanistan and the treatment of women by the taliban afghanistan is rich in natural resources including lithium iron zinc and copper it is the secondlargest producer of cannabis resin41 and third largest of both saffron42 and cashmere43 the country is a member of the south asian association for regional cooperation and a founding member

worlds least developed countries ranking 182nd on the human development index afghanistans gross domestic product gdp is 81 billion by purchasing power parity and 201 billion by nominal values per capita its gdp is among the lowest of any country as of 2020update some scholars suggest that the root name afghn is derived from the sanskrit word avakan which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the hindu kush44 avakan literally means horsemen horse breeders or cavalrymen from ava the sanskrit and avestan words for horse45 historically the ethnonym afghn was used to refer to ethnic pashtuns46 the arabic and persian form of the name afn was first attested in the 10thcentury geography book hudud alalam47 the last part of the name stan is a persian suffix meaning place of therefore afghanistan translates to land of the afghans or land of the pashtuns in a historical sense according to the third edition of the encyclopaedia of islam48 the name afghanistan afghnistn land of the afghans pashtuns afghina sing afghn can be traced to the early eighthfourteenth century when it designated the easternmost part of the kartid realm this name was later used for certain regions in the afavid and mughal empires that were inhabited by afghans while based on a statesupporting elite of abdl durrn afghans the sadz durrn polity that came into being in 1160 1747 was not called afghanistan in its own day the name became a state designation only during the colonial intervention of the nineteenth century the term afghanistan was officially used in 1855 when the british recognized dost mohammad khan as king of afghanistan49 excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now afghanistan at least 50000 years ago and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world an important site of early historical activities many believe that afghanistan compares to egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites5051 artifacts typical of the paleolithic mesolithic neolithic bronze and iron ages have been found in afghanistan urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 bce and the early city of mundigak near kandahar in the south of the country was a center of the helmand culture more recent findings established that the indus valley civilization stretched up towards modernday afghanistan an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan525354 after 2000 bce successive waves of seminomadic people from central asia began moving south into afghanistan among them were many indoeuropeanspeaking indoiranians these tribes later migrated further into south asia western asia and toward europe via the area north of the caspian sea the region at the time was referred to as ariana5055 by the middle of the 6th century bce the achaemenids overthrew the medes and incorporated arachosia aria and bactria within its eastern boundaries an inscription on the tombstone of darius i of persia mentions the kabul valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered56 the region of arachosia around kandahar in modernday southern afghanistan used to be primarily zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the avesta to persia and is thus considered by some to be the second homeland of zoroastrianism575859 alexander the great and his macedonian forces arrived in afghanistan in 330 bce after defeating darius iii of persia a year earlier in the battle of gaugamela following alexanders brief occupation the successor state of the seleucid empire controlled the region until 305 bce when they gave much of it to the maurya empire as part of an alliance treaty the mauryans controlled the area south of the hindu kush until they were overthrown in about 185 bce their decline began 60 years after ashokas rule ended leading to the hellenistic reconquest by the grecobactrians much of it soon broke away and became part of the indogreek kingdom they were defeated and expelled by the indoscythians in the late 2nd century bce6061 the silk road appeared during the first century bce and afghanistan flourished with trade with routes to china india persia and north to the cities of bukhara samarkand and khiva in presentday uzbekistan62 goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point such as chinese silk persian silver and roman gold while the region of present afghanistan was mining and trading lapis lazuli stones63 mainly from the badakhshan region during the first century bce the parthian empire subjugated the region but lost it to their indoparthian vassals in the midtolate first century ce the vast kushan empire centered in afghanistan became great patrons of buddhist culture making buddhism flourish throughout the region the kushans were overthrown by the sassanids in the 3rd century ce though the indosassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region they were followed by the kidarites who in turn was replaced by the hephthalites they were replaced by the turk shahi in the 7th century the buddhist turk shahi of kabul was replaced by a hindu dynasty before the saffarids conquered the area in 870 this hindu dynasty was called hindu shahi64 much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by buddhist culture6566 arab muslims brought islam to herat and zaranj in 642 ce and began spreading eastward some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted before the arrival of islam the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults often resulting in syncretism between the dominant religions6768 such as zoroastrianism575859 buddhism or grecobuddhism ancient iranian religions69 hinduism christianity7071 and judaism7273 an exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of buddhism but still worshipped local iranian gods such as ahura mazda lady nana anahita or mihr mithra and portrayed greek gods as protectors of buddha746975 the zunbils and kabul shahi were first conquered in 870 ce by the saffarid muslims of zaranj later the samanids extended their islamic influence south of the hindu kush the ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century767778 by the 11th century mahmud of ghazni had defeated the remaining hindu rulers and effectively islamized the wider region79 with the exception of kafiristan80 mahmud made ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian albiruni and the poet ferdowsi81 the ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the ghurids in 1186 whose architectural achievements included the remote minaret of jam the ghurids controlled afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the khwarazmian dynasty in 121582 in 1219 ce genghis khan and his mongol army overran the region his troops are said to have annihilated the khwarazmian cities of herat and balkh as well as bamyan83 the destruction caused by the mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society84 mongol rule continued with the ilkhanate in the northwest while the khalji dynasty administered the afghan tribal areas south of the hindu kush until the invasion of timur aka tamerlane who established the timurid empire in 1370 under the rule of shah rukh the city of herat85 served as the focal point of the timurid renaissance whose glory matched florence of the italian renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth8687 in the early 16th century babur arrived from ferghana and captured kabul from the arghun dynasty88 babur would go on to conquer the afghan lodi dynasty who had ruled the delhi sultanate in the first battle of panipat89 between the 16th and 18th century the uzbek khanate of bukhara iranian safavids and indian mughals ruled parts of the territory90 during the medieval period the northwestern area of afghanistan was referred to by the regional name khorasan which was commonly used up to the 19th century among natives to describe their country91929394 in 1709 mirwais hotak a local ghilzai tribal leader successfully rebelled against the safavids he defeated gurgin khan the georgian governor of kandahar under the safavids and established his own kingdom95 mirwais died in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother abdul aziz who was soon killed by mirwaiss son mahmud

victory for this campaign102 from 1749 to 1767 ahmad shah led six more invasions the most important being the last the third battle of panipat created a power vacuum in northern india halting maratha expansion ahmad shah durrani died in october 1772 and a civil war over succession followed with his named successor timur shah durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother suleiman mirza103 timur shah durrani ascended to the throne in november 1772 having defeated a coalition under shah wali khan and humayun mirza timur shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him purging durrani sardars and influential tribal leaders in kabul and kandahar one of timur shahs reforms was to move the capital of the durrani empire from kandahar to kabul timur shah fought multiple series of rebellions to consolidate the empire and he also led campaigns into punjab against the sikhs like his father though more successfully the most prominent example of his battles during this campaign was when he led his forces under zangi khan durrani with over 18000 men total of afghan qizilbash and mongol cavalrymen against over 60000 sikh men the sikhs lost over 30000 in this battle and staged a durrani resurgence in the punjab region104 the durranis lost multan in 1772 after ahmad shahs death following this victory timur shah was able to lay siege to multan and recapture it105 incorporating it into the durrani empire once again reintegrating it as a province until the siege of multan 1818 timur shah was succeeded by his son zaman shah durrani after his

rebellious ranjit singh108 however he was forced to withdraw and zaman shahs reign was ended by mahmud shah durrani108 however just under two years into his reign mahmud shah durrani was deposed by

shuja and forced him to flee usurping the throne again his second reign began on 3 may 1809111 by the early 19th century the afghan empire was under threat from the persians in the west and the sikh empire in the east fateh khan leader of the barakzai tribe installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire fateh khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by mahmud shah as a result the brothers of fateh khan and the barakzai tribe rebelled and a civil war brewed during this turbulent period afghanistan fractured into many states including the principality of qandahar emirate of herat khanate of qunduz maimana khanate and numerous other warring polities the most prominent state was the emirate of kabul ruled by dost mohammad khan112113 with the collapse of the durrani empire and the exile of the sadozai dynasty to be left to rule in herat punjab and kashmir were lost to ranjit singh ruler of the sikh empire who invaded khyber pakhtunkhwa in march 1823 and captured the city of peshawar following the battle of nowshera in 1834 dost mohammad khan led numerous campaigns firstly campaigning to jalalabad and then allying with his rival brothers in kandahar to defeat shah shuja durrani and the british in the expedition of shuja ulmulk114 in 1837 dost mohammad khan attempted to conquer peshawar and sent a large force under his son wazir akbar khan leading to the battle of jamrud akbar khan and the afghan army failed to capture the jamrud fort from the sikh khalsa army but killed sikh commander hari singh nalwa thus ending the afghansikh wars by this time the british were advancing from the east capitalizing on the decline of the sikh empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of ranjit singh which engaged the emirate of kabul in the first major conflict during the great game115 in 1839 a british expeditionary force marched into afghanistan invading the principality of qandahar and in august 1839 seized kabul dost mohammad khan defeated the british in the parwan campaign but surrendered following his victory he was replaced with the former durrani ruler shah shuja durrani as the new ruler of kabul a de facto puppet of the british116117 following an uprising that saw the assassination of shah shuja the 1842 retreat from kabul of britishindian forces and the annihilation of elphinstones army and the punitive expedition of the battle of kabul that led to its sacking the british gave up on their attempts to try to subjugate afghanistan allowing dost mohammad khan to return as ruler following this dost mohammad pursued a myriad of campaigns to unite most of afghanistan in his reign launching numerous incursions including against the surrounding states such as the hazarajat campaign conquest of balkh conquest of kunduz and the conquest of kandahar dost mohammad led his final campaign against herat conquering it and reuniting afghanistan during his campaigns of reunification he held friendly relations with the british despite the first angloafghan war and affirmed their status in the second angloafghan treaty of 1857 while bukhara and internal religious leaders pressured dost mohammad to invade india during the indian rebellion of 1857118 dost mohammad died in june 1863 a few weeks after his successful campaign to herat following his death a civil war ensued among his sons prominently mohammad afzal khan mohammad azam khan and sher ali khan sher ali won the resulting afghan civil war 18631869 and ruled afghanistan until his death in 1879 in his final years the british returned to afghanistan in the second angloafghan war to fight perceived russian influence in the region sher ali retreated to northern afghanistan intending to create a resistance there similar to his predecessors dost mohammad khan and wazir akbar khan his untimely death however saw yaqub khan declared the new amir leading to britain gaining control of afghanistans foreign relations as part of the treaty of gandamak of 1879 making it an official british protected state119120 an uprising however restarted the conflict and yaqub khan was deposed during this tumultuous period abdur rahman khan began his rise to power becoming an eligible candidate to become amir after he seized much of northern afghanistan abdur rahman marched on kabul and was declared amir being recognized by the british as well another uprising by ayub khan threatened the british where rebels confronted and defeated british forces in the battle of maiwand following up on his victory ayub khan unsuccessfully besieged kandahar and his decisive defeat saw the end of the second angloafghan war with abdur rahman secured firmly as amir121 in 1893 abdur rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic pashtun and baloch territories were divided by the durand line which forms the modernday border between pakistan and afghanistan shiadominated hazarajat and pagan kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by abdur rahman khan in 18911896 he was known as the iron amir for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes122 he died in 1901 succeeded by his son habibullah khan how can a small power like afghanistan which is like a goat between these lions britain and russia or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust abdur rahman khan the iron amir in 1900123124 during the first world war when afghanistan was neutral habibullah khan was met by officials of the central powers in the niedermayerhentig expedition they called on afghanistan to declare full independence from the united kingdom join them and attack british india as part of the hindugerman conspiracy the effort to bring afghanistan into the central powers failed but it sparked discontent among the population about maintaining neutrality with the british habibullah was assassinated in february 1919 and amanullah khan eventually assumed power a staunch supporter of the 19151916 expeditions amanullah khan invaded british india beginning the third angloafghan war and entering british india via the khyber pass125 after the end of the third angloafghan war and the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi on 19 august 1919 emir amanullah khan declared the emirate of afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state he moved to end his countrys traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community particularly with the soviet union and the weimar republic126127 he proclaimed himself king of afghanistan on 9 june 1926 forming the kingdom of afghanistan he introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation a key force behind these reforms was mahmud tarzi an ardent supporter of the education of women he fought for article 68 of afghanistans 1923 constitution which made elementary education compulsory slavery was abolished in 1923128 king amanullahs wife queen soraya was an important figure during this period in the fight for womans education and against their oppression129 some of the reforms such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of coeducational schools alienated many tribal and religious leaders leading to the afghan civil war 19281929 king amanullah abdicated in january 1929 and soon after kabul fell to saqqawist forces led by habibullah kalakani130 mohammed nadir shah amanullahs cousin defeated and killed kalakani in october 1929 and was declared king nadir shah131 he abandoned the reforms of king amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization but was assassinated in 1933 by abdul khaliq132 mohammed zahir shah succeeded to the throne and reigned as king from 1933 to 1973 during the tribal revolts of 19441947 king zahirs reign was challenged by zadran safi mangal and wazir tribesmen led by mazrak zadran salemai and mirzali khan among others many of whom were amanullah loyalists afghanistan joined the league of nations in 1934 the 1930s saw the development of roads infrastructure the founding of a national bank and increased education road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry133 the country built close relationships with the axis powers with nazi germany having the largest share in afghan development at the time134 until 1946 king zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle who held the post of prime minister and continued the policies of nadir shah another uncle shah mahmud khan became prime minister in 1946 and experimented with allowing greater political freedom he was replaced in 1953 by mohammed daoud khan a pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a pashtunistan leading to highly tense relations with pakistan135 daoud khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the soviet union afterward the 1964 constitution was formed and the first nonroyal prime minister was sworn in133 zahir shah like his father nadir shah had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization creating nationalist feeling and improving relations with the united kingdom afghanistan was neither a participant in world war ii nor aligned with either power bloc in the cold war however it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the soviet union and the united states vied for influence by building afghanistans main highways airports and other vital infrastructure on a per capita basis afghanistan received more soviet development aid than any other country in 1973 while the king was in italy daoud khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first president of afghanistan abolishing the monarchy in april 1978 the communist peoples democratic party of afghanistan pdpa seized power in a bloody coup dtat against thenpresident mohammed daoud khan in what is called the saur revolution the pdpa declared the establishment of the democratic republic of afghanistan with its first leader named as peoples democratic party general secretary nur muhammad taraki136 this would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn afghanistan from a peaceful albeit poor and secluded country to a hotbed of conflict and terrorism137 the pdpa initiated various social symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition while also brutally oppressing political dissidents this caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979 waged by guerrilla mujahideen and smaller maoist guerrillas against regime forces countrywide it quickly turned into a proxy war as the pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers the united states supported them through pakistans interservices intelligence isi138 and the soviet union sent thousands of military advisers to support the pdpa regime139 meanwhile there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the pdpa the dominant khalq and the more moderate parcham140 in october 1979 pdpa general secretary taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by thenprime minister hafizullah amin who became the new general secretary of the pdpa the situation in the country deteriorated under amin and thousands of people went missing141 displeased with amins government the soviet army invaded the country in december 1979 heading for kabul and killing amin142 a sovietorganized regime led by parchams babrak karmal but inclusive of both factions parcham and khalq filled the vacuum soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize afghanistan under karmal marking the beginning of the sovietafghan war143 lasting nine years the war caused the deaths of between 562000144 and 2 million afghansh and displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled afghanistan mainly to pakistan and iran152 heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages millions of landmines were planted153 and some cities such as herat and kandahar were also damaged from bombardment after the soviet withdrawal another civil war ensued until the communist regime under pdpa leader mohammad najibullah collapsed in 1992154155156 the sovietafghan war had drastic social effects on afghanistan the militarization of society led to heavily armed police private bodyguards openly armed civil defense groups and the like becoming the norm in afghanistan for decades thereafter157 the traditional power structure had shifted from clergy community elders intelligentsia and military in favor of powerful warlords158 another civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting159160161 various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape murder and extortion160162163 while kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting163 several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders164 the taliban emerged in september 1994 as a movement and militia of students talib from islamic madrassas schools in pakistan163165 who soon had military support from pakistan166 taking control of kandahar city that year163 they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of rabbani from kabul in 1996167168 where they established an emirate169 the taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of islamic sharia law which resulted in the brutal treatment of many afghans especially women170171 during their rule the taliban and their allies committed massacres against afghan civilians denied un food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homesi after the fall of kabul to the taliban ahmad shah massoud and abdul rashid dostum formed the northern alliance later joined by others to resist the taliban dostums forces were defeated by the taliban during the battles of mazarisharif in 1997 and 1998 pakistans chief of army staff pervez musharraf began sending thousands of pakistanis to help the taliban defeat the northern alliancej by 2000 the northern alliance only controlled 10 of territory cornered in the

united states invaded afghanistan to remove the taliban from power after they refused to hand over osama bin laden the prime suspect of the september 11 attacks who was a guest of the taliban and was operating his alqaeda network in afghanistan183184185 the majority of afghans supported the american invasion186187 during the initial invasion us and uk forces bombed alqaeda training camps and later working with the northern alliance the taliban regime came to an end188 in december 2001 after the taliban government was overthrown the afghan interim administration under hamid karzai was formed the international security assistance force isaf was established by the un security council to help assist the karzai administration and provide basic security189190 by this time after two decades of war
