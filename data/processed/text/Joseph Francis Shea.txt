joseph francis shea september 5 1925 february 14 1999 was an american aerospace engineer and nasa manager born in the the bronx borough of new york city he was educated at the university of michigan receiving a phd in engineering mechanics in 1955 after working for bell labs on the radio inertial guidance systemclarification needed of the titan i intercontinental ballistic missile he was hired by nasa in 1961 as deputy director of nasas office of manned space flight and later as head of the apollo spacecraft program office shea played a key role in shaping the course of the apollo program helping to lead nasa to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting all up testing of the saturn v rocket while sometimes causing controversy within the agency shea was remembered by his former colleague george mueller as one of the greatest systems engineers of our time1 deeply involved in the investigation of the 1967 apollo 1 fire shea suffered from stress he was moved to an alternative position in washington and left nasa shortly afterwards from 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at raytheon in lexington massachusetts and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit while shea served as a consultant for nasa on the redesign of the international space station in 1993 he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues shea was born september 5 1925 and grew up in the bronx the eldest son in a workingclass irish catholic family his father worked as a mechanic on the new york city subway as a child shea had no interest in engineering he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete he attended a catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen2 on graduating in 1943 shea enlisted in the us navy and enrolled in a program that would put him through college he began his studies at dartmouth college later moving to mit and finally to the university of michigan where he would remain until he earned his doctorate in 19552 in 1946 he was commissioned as an ensign in the navy and received a bachelor of science degree in mathematics1 shea went on to earn a msc 1950 and a phd 1955 in engineering mechanics from the university of michigan while obtaining his doctorate shea found the time to teach at the university and to hold down a job at bell labs3 after receiving his doctorate shea took a position at bell labs in whippany new jersey there he first worked as systems engineer on the radio guidance system of the titan i intercontinental ballistic missile icbm and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the titan ii icbm4 sheas specialty was systems engineering a new type of engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of largescale projects turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole he played a significant role in the titan i project as george mueller writes he contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system4 in addition to sheas technical abilities it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people known for his quick intellect he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings5 during the critical days of the titan project shea moved into the plant sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed6 having brought in the project on time and on budget shea established a reputation in the aerospace community6 in 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with space technology laboratories a division of trw inc where he continued to work on ballistic missile systems47 in december 1961 nasa invited shea to interview for the position of deputy director of the office of manned space flight omsf d brainerd holmes director of the omsf had been searching for a deputy who could offer expertise in systems engineering someone with the technical abilities to supervise the apollo program as a whole shea was recommended by one of holmes advisors who had worked with him at bell labs8 although shea had worked at space technology labs for less than a year he was captivated by the challenge offered by the nasa position i could see they needed good people in the space program he later said and i was kind of cocky in those days6 when shea was hired by nasa president john f kennedys commitment to landing men on the moon was still only seven months old and many of the major decisions that shaped the apollo program were yet to be made foremost among these was the mode that nasa would use to land on the moon when shea first began to consider the issue in 1962 most nasa engineers and managersincluding wernher von braun the director of the marshall space flight centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent where the apollo spacecraft would land on the moon and return to the earth as one unit or earth orbit rendezvous where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the earth however dissenters such as john houbolt a langley engineer favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky lunar orbit rendezvous in which two spacecraft would be used a commandservice module csm would remain in orbit around the moon while a lunar module would land on the moon and return to dock with the csm in lunar orbit then be discarded9 in november 1961 john houbolt had sent a paper advocating lunar orbit rendezvous lor to robert seamans the deputy administrator of nasa as shea remembered seamans gave a copy of houbolts letter to brainerd holmes the director of omsf holmes put the letter on my desk and said figure it out10 shea became involved in the lunar orbit rendezvous decision as a result of this letter while he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous shea prided himself according to space historians murray and cox on going wherever the data took him11 in this case the data took him to nasas langley research center in hampton virginia where he met with john houbolt and with the space task group and became convinced that lor was an option worth considering12 sheas task now became to shepherd nasa to a firm decision on the issue this task was complicated by the fact that he had to build consensus between nasas different centersmost notably the manned spacecraft center in houston headed by robert gilruth and the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama headed by wernher von braun relations between the centers were not good and it was a major milestone in the progress of the apollo program when von braun and his team finally came to accept the superiority of the lor concept nasa announced its decision at a press conference on july 11 1962 only six months after shea had joined nasa space historian james hansen concludes that shea played a major role in supporting houbolts ideas and making the decision in favor of lor12 while his former colleague george mueller writes that it is a tribute to joes logic and leadership that he was able to build a consensus within the centers at a time when they were autonomous13 during his time at the omsf shea helped to resolve many of the other inevitable engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the apollo spacecraft in may 1963 he formed a panel review board bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between nasa centers under sheas leadership this coordination became far more efficient14 in october 1963 shea became the new manager of the apollo spacecraft program office aspo in houston although technically a demotion this new position gave shea the responsibility for managing the design and construction of the apollo command and lunar modules of particular concern to shea was the performance of north american aviation the contractor responsible for the command module he later recounted i do not have a high opinion of north american and their motives in the early days their first program manager was a firstclass jerk there were spots of good guys but it was just an ineffective organization they had no discipline no concept of change control15 it was sheas responsibility to bring that engineering discipline to north american and to nasas management of its contractors his systems management experience served him well in his new post in the coming years any change to the design of the apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from shea himself16 he kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himselfa looseleaf notebook more than a hundred pages in length that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made presented with the notebook on thursday evenings shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions instructions and decisions this idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and everexpanding program17 sheas relationship with the engineers at north american was a difficult one while shea blamed north americans management for the continuing difficulties in the development of the command module project leader harrison storms felt that nasa itself was far from blameless it had delayed in making key design decisions and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun while shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests storms felt that shea did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the daytoday work of manufacturing18 shea was a controversial figure even at the manned spacecraft center not having been at langley with the space task group he was considered an outsider by men such as flight director chris kraft who recalled that the animosity between my people and sheas was intense19 relations between shea and other nasa centers were even more uneasy as the deputy director of omsf shea had sought to extend the authority of nasa headquarters over the fiercely independent nasa centers this was particularly problematic when it came to the marshall space flight center which had developed its own culture under wernher von braun von brauns philosophy of engineering differed from sheas taking a consensual rather than topdown approach as one historian recounts von braun felt that shea had bitten off too much work and was going to wreck the centers engineering capabilities20 the friction between shea and marshall which had begun when shea was at omsf continued after he moved to his new position he became deeply involved in supporting george muellers effort to impose the idea of all up testing of the saturn v rocket on the unwilling engineers at marshall von brauns approach to engineering was a conservative one emphasizing the incremental testing of components but the tight schedule of the apollo program did not allow for this slow and careful process what mueller and shea proposed was to test the saturn v as one unit on its very first flight and marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 196321 when later asked how he and mueller had managed to sell the idea to von braun shea responded that we just told him thats the way its going to be finally22 sheas role in resolving differences within nasa and between nasa and its contractors placed him in a position where criticism was inevitable however even sheas critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills everyone who knew shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer23 and his time as manager at aspo only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the titan project of sheas work in the mid1960s murray and cox write that these were joe sheas glory days and whatever the swirl of opinions about this gifted enigmatic man he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward24 sheas work also won wider attention bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to wernher von braun or chris kraft kraft had appeared on the cover of time in 1965 time planned to offer shea the same honor in february 1967 the month in which the first crewed apollo mission was scheduled to occur25 problems with the apollo command module continued through the testing phase the review meeting for the first spacecraft intended for a crewed mission took place on august 19 1966 one issue of concern was the amount of velcro in the cabin a potential fire hazard in the pureoxygen atmosphere of the spacecraft if there were to be a spark shea later recounted and so the issue was brought up at the acceptance of the spacecraft a long drawnout discussion i got a little annoyed and i said look theres no way theres going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless theres a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard were not going to let them smoke well i then issued orders at that meeting go clean up the spacecraft be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed26 although the spacecraft passed its review the crew finished the meeting by presenting shea with a picture of the three of them seated around a model of the capsule heads bowed in prayer the inscription was it isnt that we dont trust you joe but this time weve decided to go over your head27 on january 25 1967 the apollo 1 crew began a series of countdown tests in the spacecraft on the pad at cape kennedy although shea had ordered his staff to direct north american to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin he had not supervised the issue directly and little if any action had been taken28 during pad testing the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems including broken and staticfilled communications wally schirra the backup commander for the mission suggested to shea that shea should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience firsthand the issues that they were facing although he seriously considered the idea it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for shea the hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the emergency egress test that had been scheduled for the end of the day on the 27th29 as shea later told the press joining the crew for the test would have been highly irregular30 a plugsout spacecraft test simulating the launch countdown took place on january 27 while shea was in florida for the beginning of the test he decided to leave before it concluded he arrived back at his office in houston at about 530 pm cst31 at 531 pm cst 631 pm est a massive fire broke out in the apollo command module unable to escape the three astronauts inside the spacecraft gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were killed immediately after the fire shea and his aspo colleagues at houston boarded a nasa plane to the kennedy space center they landed at about 100 am only five hours after the fire had broken out at a meeting that morning with robert gilruth george mueller and george low shea helped to determine the individuals who would be on the nasa review board looking into the causes of the fire additionally he persuaded george mueller head of nasas office of manned space flight to allow him to act as muellers deputy in florida supervising the progress of the investigation32 named to the advisory group chosen to support the review board33 shea threw himself into the investigation working eightyhour weeks34 although the precise source of ignition was never found it soon became clear that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire probably sparked by a chafed wire what was less clear was where to apportion responsibility nasa engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by north american aviation35 by contrast north american executives blamed nasa management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space in which almost any materialincluding velcro with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark36 whatever the precise distribution of responsibility shea remained haunted by the feeling that he personally was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts for years after the fire he displayed the portrait given to him by the apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home37 the pressure of the investigation took a psychological toll on shea he had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help himself cope38 shea was not the only nasa employee who found the aftermath of the fire difficult to handle robert seamans wrote that key people from houston would fly up to washington to testify and literally sob all the way on the plane39 and a man who worked under shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket40 a few weeks after the fire sheas colleagues began to notice that he too was behaving erratically chris kraft whose father had suffered from schizophrenia later related sheas behavior in one meeting joe shea got up and started calmly with a report on the state of the investigation but within a minute he was rambling and in another thirty seconds he was incoherent i looked at him and saw my father in the grip of dementia praecox it was horrifying and fascinating at the same time41 nasa administrator james webb became increasingly worried about sheas mental state specifically he was concerned that shea might not be able to deal with the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the apollo 1 fire senator walter mondale had accused nasa engineers of criminal negligence with regard to the design and construction of the apollo command module and it was expected that shea would be in the firing line in march webb sent robert seamans and charles berry nasas head physician to speak with shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence this would they hoped protect him from being called to testify a press release had already been prepared but shea refused threatening to resign rather than take leave as a compromise he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness yet this approach to removing shea from his position was also unsuccessful42 one of his friends later recounted the psychiatrists came back saying hes so smart hes so intelligent here joe was ready to kill himself but he could still outsmart the psychiatrists43 at that point sheas superiors felt forced to take a more direct approach on april 7 it was announced that shea would be transferred to nasa headquarters in washington dc to serve as george muellers deputy in the office of manned space flight he was replaced as chief of the apollo spacecraft program office by george low44 while shea had already acted as muellers de facto deputy in florida during the investigation the reality of this permanent posting was very different when sheas reassignment was announced one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to time magazine in which he said that if joe stays in washington itll be a promotion if he leaves in three or four months youll know this move amounted to being fired45 shea accepted the reassignment reluctantly feeling that it was as if nasa was trying to hide me from the congress for what i might have said46 once in the job he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he considered to be a nonjob46 later commenting that i dont understand why after everything i had done for the program i was only one that was removed thats the end of the program for me47 only six months after the fire and some two months after taking his new position shea left nasa in order to become a vice president at the polaroid corporation in waltham massachusetts he was never called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire in 1968 shea took a position at raytheon in lexington massachusetts he would remain with the company until his retirement in 1990 serving as senior vice president for engineering from 1981 through 199048 after leaving raytheon shea became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit7 in february 1993 nasa administrator daniel goldin appointed shea to the chairmanship of a technical review board convened to oversee the redesign of the troubled international space station49 however shea was hospitalized shortly after his appointment by april he was well enough to attend a meeting where the design team formally presented the preliminary results of its studies but his behavior at the meeting again called his capacities into question the washington post reported shea made a rambling sometimes barely audible twohour presentation that left many of those present speculating about his ability to do the job a longtime friend said thats not the real joe shea he is normally incisive and wellorganized50 on the day following the meeting shea offered his resignation becoming instead a special advisor to goldin50 nasa reported that he had resigned for health reasons however the scientist offered a different interpretation quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness of his speech including criticisms of goldin may have been controversial in nasa circles51 shea died on february 14 1999 at his home in weston massachusetts he was survived by his wife carol six daughters and one son4852
