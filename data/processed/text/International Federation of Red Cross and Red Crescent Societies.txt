the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc is a worldwide humanitarian aid organization that reaches 160 million people each year through its 191 member national societies5 it acts before during and after disasters and health emergencies to meet the needs and improve the lives of vulnerable people67 it does so independently and with impartiality as to nationality race gender religious beliefs class and political opinions8 the ifrc is part of the international red cross and red crescent movement along with the international committee of the red cross icrc and 191 national societies9 the ifrcs strength lies in its volunteer network communitybased expertise and independence and neutrality it works to improve humanitarian standards as partners in development and in response to disasters it persuades decision makers to act in the interests of vulnerable people it works to enable healthy and safe communities reduce vulnerabilities strengthen resilience and foster a culture of peace around the world on 5 may 1919 following the first world war representatives from the national red cross societies of the allied powers united kingdom france italy japan and united states came together in paris to establish the league of red cross societies lorcs whose stated goal was to strengthen and unite for health activities alreadyexisting red cross societies and to promote the creation of new societies10 the initiative was taken by henry p davison then chairman of the american red cross war committee10 with the support of woodrow wilson the president of the united states of america davison was assisted by the british general sir david henderson who became the first directorgeneral this newly created federation of national societies expanded the international mandate of the red cross movement beyond the strict mission of the international committee of the red cross icrc to include relief assistance in response to emergencies which were not caused by armed conflict in addition to the coordination of relief operations caused by natural disasters and health emergencies the leagues mission was to assist national societies in their founding and development especially in peacetime11 in addition to providing assistance to victims of epidemics natural disasters earthquakes floods and hurricanes and famines two other activities were developed during the first years of the league one main activity was to promote health by preventing illnesses and developing the training of nurses and volunteers the other activity was to create the junior red cross within the national societies which introduced children and students to the red cross with various educational courses and involved them in practical relief activities the formation of the league as an additional international red cross organization alongside the icrc was not without controversy the icrc had to some extent valid concerns about a possible rivalry between the two organizations the foundation of the league was seen as an attempt to undermine the leadership position of the icrc within the movement and to gradually transfer tasks and competencies to a multilateral institution as well davison did not want to include national societies of the defeated powers namely germany austria hungary bulgaria and turkey which was contrary to the icrcs principle of universality moreover the leagues beginnings were expeditious as it took 154 days between the approval of president wilson and its incorporation this hasty formation forced davison to cut corners and leave unresolved issues such as a clear framework of the leagues mandate duties and funding the coexistence concerns between the league and the icrc were discussed during three consecutive international conferences of the red cross 1921 1923 1926 the statutes adopted in 1928 at the xiiith international conference of the red cross in the hague clarified and confirmed the roles of each entity12 in that same year the international council was founded to coordinate cooperation between the icrc and the league a task which was later taken over by the standing commission of the red cross and red crescent in 1920 the leagues general council originally composed of representatives of the victorious allies13 welcomed additional national societies 27 out of the 31 member societies were represented in 1920 in the following decade the league admitted over 25 national societies including the egyptian red crescent and the red lion and sun of iran14 following the adoption of the statutes of the international red cross in 1928 revised in 1952 and 1986 amended in 1995 and 2006 the national societies of the nordic red cross denmark finland sweden and norway returned to the league after resigning three years earlier because of the discords within the red cross movement15 the alliance of the red cross and red crescent societies of the soviet union joined the league during the xvth international conference in 1934 by the mid1930s the league became truly universal with 58 registered national societies16 the leagues headquarters named the secretariat was originally based in geneva the league moved its secretariat from geneva to paris in 1922 with a restrained budget and reduced staff the need to move away from the icrc to further develop the leagues own identity was part of the decisionmaking on september 5 1939 days following the german troops invasion of poland the league personnel in paris were moved to geneva the league believed it could ensure the continuity of its work from a neutral country such as switzerland to this day the secretariats offices have remained in geneva but it was only in 1959 that the secretariat moved into its current headquarters in petitsaconnex17 during the first years of the league the work was essentially reactive and consisted mostly of recording information and statistics to be shared with the national societies18 the leagues first operational mission was to perform onsite observations of the conditions of the victims of a typhus epidemic in poland19 and to develop and circulate information material to the surrounding countries to prevent the spread of similar epidemics the first largescale relief action of the league came after the 1923 earthquake in japan which killed about 200000 people and left countless more injured and without shelter for the first time 35 national red cross societies participated in a joint action of the icrc and the league for which a record sum of 277 million swiss francs was donated20 the league began issuing appeals in 1925 but appeals were not consistently issued for all disasters during the 1920s and 1930s disaster relief remained a minor activity behind public health nursing and youth activities the national societies with the leagues assistance in the 1920s were better prepared to deal with disaster relief and consequently less in need of external assistance21 additionally the great depression caused economic insecurity worldwide urging the league to dedicate more coverage to poverty programs the 1930s saw the growing use of the automobile the development of road infrastructure and consequently the increase of traffic and casualties the league became a leader in first aid prevention for road accidents by establishing in 1932 a permanent committee on first aid on roads with the collaboration of various motoring associations22 as the world headed closer to another war the activities of the league reduced considerably nonetheless the collaboration between the league and the icrc continued to grow the league provided support to the icrc in the late 1930s notably during the spanish civil war and the second sinojapanese war by issuing appeals and establishing distribution points of food and medical supplies for the civilians the joint relief commission initiated by the icrc in 1941 established the mandates of the league and the icrc ensuring their continuous support to the national societies amid the intensifying war this agreement also increased the national societies independence and allowed them to pursue their civilian relief activities without causing friction with the belligerent occupied and neutral states after a sixyear hiatus the board of governors held its first meeting in october 1945 the postwar period provided a new driving force to the league as it resumed its relations with the national societies and provided relief to waraffected regions in december 1948 the league of red cross societies was invited along with the icrc and afsc by the united nations to take part in a 32 million emergency relief program working with palestinian refugees the league was given responsibility for lebanon syria and jordan and the american friends service committee for the gaza strip2324 following disastrous weather conditions that afflicted parts of the world between 1951 and 195425 the leagues relief activities became more operational and were no longer entirely informational during those years the league issued numerous appeals and showed great efficiency in disaster relief operations in the late 1950s there was a marked increase in the number of recognized red cross and red crescent national societies due to decolonisation26 by the end of the 1960s there were more than 100 societies around the world27 on december 10 1963 the league and the icrc jointly received the nobel peace prize28 in 1983 the league of red cross societies was renamed the league of red cross and red crescent societies to reflect the growing number of national societies operating under the red crescent symbol three years later the seven fundamental principles of the movement as adopted at the xxth international conference of the red cross in 196529 were incorporated into the leagues statutes the name of the league was changed again during the general assembly of 1991 to its current official designation the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc in 1997 the icrc and the ifrc signed the seville agreement which further defined the responsibilities of both organisations within the movement30 until the beginning of the 1990s all disaster relief operations were responded to as one federation in a multilateral form donor red cross national societies were used to provide support through the federation secretariat with money and human resources to support the federation in the response to disasters under the coordination and leadership of the federation secretariat the focus at that time was of one team with a common mission common goals in support of a sister red cross or red crescent society affected by a disaster hurricane mitch affected few countries in central america in 1998 the disaster relief efforts could be considered one of the disaster response operations that change the course of multilateralism within the membership of the international federation since then bilateralism become the new norm and the reduce number of red cross from wealthy countries responding to disasters and expanding to development work continuously grow during the 2000s including the growing number of red crescent societies operating internationally in 2004 the ifrc began its largest mission to date after the tsunami disaster in south asia more than 40 national societies worked with more than 22000 volunteers to bring relief to the countless victims left without food and shelter and endangered by the risk of epidemics31 the ifrc coordinates between national red cross and red crescent societies throughout the world the ifrc along with icrc supports the foundation of new national societies in countries where no official society exists a national society is admitted as a member to the ifrc only after it is recognized by the icrc the ifrc cooperates with the national societies of the affected countries called the host national society hns as well as the national societies of other countries willing to offer assistance called partner national societies pns among the 190 national societies admitted to the general assembly of the ifrc as full members or observers about 2530 regularly work as pns in other countries the most active are the american red cross the british red cross the german red cross and the red cross societies of sweden and norway another major mission of the ifrc which has gained attention in recent years is its commitment to work towards a codified worldwide ban on the use of land mines and to bring medical psychological and social support for people injured by land mines the stated tasks of the ifrc can be summarized as follows the red cross red crescent

is the primary motto of the ifrc article 1 of the constitution of the federation the mission statement of the ifrc as formulated in its strategy 2010 document is to improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity from 1999 to 2004 the common slogan for all activities of the international movement was the power of humanity in december 2003 the 28th international conference in geneva adopted the conference motto protecting human dignity as the new slogan for the entire movement the official logo for the international red cross and red crescent movement published in april 2016 was described as the red cross and red crescent emblems placed together side by side encircled by the words international movement in one or other of their official languages arabic chinese english french russian or spanish it was described as for use when the icrc the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies and the national red cross and red crescent societies operate together for the purposes of a humanitarian emergency or a theme or campaign of global concern37 the seven fundamental principles that guide the work of the ifrc and its members are humanity impartiality neutrality independence voluntary service unity and universality the ifrc has come into conflict with the icrc at various times first and foremost when the american red cross threatened to supplant the icrc with its creation of the league as a real international red cross after the first world war38 several agreements about the respective roles of the organizations helped to smooth relations beginning with the agreement of 1928 the 1997 seville agreement and most recently the supplementary measures of 2005 the seville agreement gives the ifrc the lead in any emergency which does not take place as part of armed conflict in which case the icrc takes charge organizational discord has now largely subsided39
