the indian plate or india plate is or was a minor tectonic plate straddling the equator in the eastern hemisphere originally a part of the ancient continent of gondwana the indian plate broke away from the other fragments of gondwana 100 million years ago and began moving north carrying insular india with it2 it was once fused with the adjacent australian plate to form a single indoaustralian plate but recent studies suggest that india and australia may have been separate plates for at least 3 million years3 the indian plate includes most of modern south asia the indian subcontinent and a portion of the basin under the indian ocean including parts of south china western indonesia45 and extending up to but not including ladakh kohistan and balochistan in pakistan678 until roughly 140 million years ago the indian plate formed part of the supercontinent gondwana together with modern africa australia antarctica and south america gondwana fragmented as these continents drifted apart at different velocities9 a process which led to the opening of the indian ocean10 in the late cretaceous approximately 100 million years ago and subsequent to the splitting from gondwana of conjoined madagascar and india the indian plate split from madagascar and formed insular india it began moving north at about 20 cm 79 in per year9 and is believed to have begun colliding with asia as early as 55 million years ago11 in the eocene epoch of the cenozoic however some authors suggest the collision between india and eurasia occurred much later around 35 million years ago12 if the collision occurred between 55 and 50 mya the indian plate would have covered a distance of 3000 to 2000 km 19001200 mi moving more quickly than any other known plate in 2012 paleomagnetic data from the greater himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the himalaya 1300 km or 800 mi and the amount of convergence between india and asia 3600 km or 2200 mi13 these authors propose a continental fragment of northern gondwana rifted from india traveled northward and initiated the soft collision between the greater himalaya and asia at 50 mya this was followed by the hard collision between india and asia occurred at 25 mya subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the greater himalayan fragment and india explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the himalaya and paleomagnetic data from india and asia however the proposed ocean basin was not constrained by paleomagnetic data from the key time interval of 120 mya to 60 mya new paleomagnetic results of this critical time interval from southern tibet do not support this greater indian ocean basin hypothesis and the associated dual collision model14 in 2007 german geologists9 suggested the reason the indian plate moved so quickly is that it is only half as thick 100 km or 62 mi as the other plates15 which formerly constituted gondwana the mantle plume that once broke up gondwana might also have melted the lower part of the indian subcontinent which allowed it to move both more quickly and farther than the other parts9 the remains of this plume today form the marion hotspot prince edward islands the kerguelen hotspot and the runion hotspots1016 as india moved north it is possible the thickness of the indian plate degenerated further as it passed over the hotspots and magmatic extrusions associated with the deccan and rajmahal traps10 the massive amounts of volcanic gases released during the passage of the indian plate over the hotspots have been theorised to have played a role in the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event generally held to be due to a large asteroid impact17 in 2020 however geologists at the university of oxford and the alfred wegener institute found that new platemotion models displayed increased movement speeds in all midocean ridges during the late cretaceous a result irreconcilable to current theories of plate tectonics and a refutation of the plumepush hypothesis prezdaz concludes that the accelerated movement of the indian plate is an illusion wrought by large errors in geomagnetic reversal timing around the cretaceouspaleogene boundary and that a recalibration of the time scale shows no such acceleration exists1819 the collision with the eurasian plate along the boundary between india and nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the tibetan plateau and the himalaya mountains as sediment bunched up like earth before a plow the indian plate is currently moving northeast at five cm 20 in per year while the eurasian plate is moving north at only two cm 079 in per year this is causing the eurasian plate to deform and the indian plate to compress at a rate of four mm 016 in per yearcitation needed the westerly side of the indian plate is a transform boundary with the arabian plate called the owen fracture zone and a divergent boundary with the african plate called the central indian ridge cir the northerly side of the plate is a convergent boundary with the eurasian plate forming the himalaya and hindu kush mountains called the main himalayan thrustcitation needed
