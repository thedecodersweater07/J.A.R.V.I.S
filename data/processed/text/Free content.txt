free content libre content libre information or free information is any kind of creative work1 such as a work of art a book2 a software program34 or any other creative content for which there are very minimal copyright and other legal limitations on usage modification and distribution these are works or expressions which can be freely studied applied copied and modified by anyone for any purpose56 including in some cases commercial purposes free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the definition of free cultural work7 in most countries the berne convention grants copyright holders control over their creations by default8 therefore copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free by the authors which is usually accomplished by referencing or including licensing statements from within the work9 the right to reuse such a work is granted by the authors in a license known as a free license a free distribution license or an open license depending on the rights assigned9 these freedoms given to users in the reuse of works that is the right to freely use study modify or distribute these works possibly also for commercial purposes are often associated with obligations to cite the original author to maintain the original license of the reused content or restrictions excluding commercial use banning certain media chosen by the author10 there are a number of standardized licenses offering varied options that allow authors to choose the type of reuse of their work that they wish to authorize or forbid11 there are a number of different definitions of free content in regular use legally however free content is very similar to open content an analogy is a use of the rival terms free software and opensource which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones1213 the term open source by contrast sought to encompass them all in one movement1415 for instance the open knowledge foundations open definition describes open as synonymous with the definition of free in the definition of free cultural works as also in the open source definition and free software definition16 for such freeopen content both movements recommend the same three creative commons licenses the cc by cc bysa and cc017181920 copyright is a legal concept which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the duplication and public performance of their work21 in many jurisdictions this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the public domain22 copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works21 during the time period of copyright the authors work may only be copied modified or publicly performed with the consent of the author unless the use is a fair use23 traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the authors content or limit their use to fair use secondly it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found24 finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works such as mashups and collaborative content25 although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright open content licenses rely on a copyright holders power to license their work as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose26 the public domain is a range of creative works whose copyright has expired or was never established as well as ideas and factsnote 1 which are ineligible for copyright a public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over the distribution and usage of the work as such any person may manipulate distribute or otherwise use the work without legal ramifications a work in the public domain or released under a permissive license may be referred to as copycenter27 copyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work28 the aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable nonauthor parties to be able to reuse and in many licensing schemes modify content that is created by an author unlike works in the public domain the author still maintains copyright over the material however the author has granted a nonexclusive license to any person to distribute and often modify the work copyleft licenses require that any derivative works be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained a symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the copyright symbol facing the other way the opening of the c points left rather than right unlike the copyright symbol the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning29 projects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest such as software academic literature general literature music images video and engineering technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments in media which includes textual audio and visual content free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by creative commons have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions not all creative commons licenses are entirely free their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistributiononly licensing since february 2008 creative commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are approved for free cultural works30 repositories exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs clip art music31 and literature32 while extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal it is usually not sensible because of the duplicate content problem wikipedia is amongst the most wellknown databases of useruploaded free content on the web while the vast majority of content on wikipedia is free content some copyrighted material is hosted under fairuse criteria free and opensource software which is often referred to as open source software and free software is a maturing technology with companies using them to provide services and technology to both endusers and technical consumers the ease of dissemination increases modularity which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration some claim that open source development models offer similar peerrecognition and collaborative benefit incentive as in more classical fields such as scientific research with the social structures that result leading to decreased production costs33 given sufficient interest in a software component by using peertopeer distribution methods distribution costs may be reduced easing the burden of infrastructure maintenance on developers as distribution is simultaneously provided by consumers these software distribution models are scalable that is the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers in some cases free software vendors may use peertopeer technology as a method of dissemination34 project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for most free projects as a number of providers offer these services free of charge free content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated in order to reduce overheads associated with project development open design principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications with projects in mobile telephony smallscale manufacture35 the automotive industry3637 and even agricultural areas technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow computeraided manufacturing and computeraided design techniques to be able to develop smallscale production of components for the development of new or repair of existing devices rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments which allow endusers of technology to be able to construct devices from preexisting blueprints using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects in academic work the majority of works are not free although the percentage of works that are open access is growing open access refers to online research outputs that are free of all restrictions to access and free of many restrictions on use eg certain copyright and license restrictions38 authors may see open access publishing as a way of expanding the audience that is able to access their work to allow for greater impact or support it for ideological reasons3940 open access publishers such as plos and biomed central provide capacity for review and publishing of free works such publications are currently more common in science than humanities various funding institutions and governing research bodies have mandated that academics must produce their works to be openaccess in order to qualify for funding such as the us national institutes of health research councils uk effective 2016 and the european union effective 2020414243 at an institutional level some universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology have adopted open access publishing by default by introducing their own mandates44 some mandates may permit delayed publication and may charge researchers for open access publishing4546 for teaching purposes some universities including mit provide freely available course content such as lecture notes video resources and tutorials this content is distributed via internet to the general public publication of such resources may be either by a formal institutionwide program47 or informally by individual academics or departments open content publication has been seen as a method of reducing costs associated with information retrieval in research as universities typically pay to subscribe for access to content that is published through traditional means2048 subscriptions for nonfree content journals may be expensive for universities to purchase though the articles are written and peerreviewed by academics themselves at no cost to the publisher this has led to disputes between publishers and some universities over subscription costs such as the one that occurred between the university of california and the nature publishing group4950 free and open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education open content is a free way of obtaining higher education that is focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content51 there are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content including opencourseware and khan academy some universities like mit yale and tufts are making their courses freely available on the internet52 there are also a number of organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks such as the university of minnesotas open textbook library connexions openstax college the saylor academy open textbook challenge and wikibooks53 any country has its own law and legal system sustained by its legislation which consists of documents in a democratic country laws are published as open content in principle free content but in general there are no explicit licenses attributed for the text of each law so the license must be assumed as an implied license only a few countries have explicit licenses in their lawdocuments as the uks open government licence a cc by compatible license in the other countries the implied license comes from its proper rules general laws and rules about copyright in government works the automatic protection provided by the berne convention does not apply to the texts of laws article 24 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection it is also possible to inherit the license from context the set of countrys lawdocuments is made available through national repositories examples of lawdocument open repositories lexml brazil legislationgovuk and nlex in general a lawdocument is offered in more than one open official version but the main one is that published by a government gazette so lawdocuments can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it the concept of applying free software licenses to content was introduced by michael stutz who in 1997 wrote the paper applying copyleft to nonsoftware information for the gnu project54 the term open content was coined by david a wiley in 1998 and evangelized via the open content project describing works licensed under the open content license a nonfree sharealike license see free content below and other works licensed under similar terms55 the website of the open content project once defined open content as freely available for modification use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the opensource free software community55 however such a definition would exclude the open content license because that license forbids charging for content a right required by free and opensource software licensescitation needed it has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions the openness of content can be assessed under the 5rs framework based on the extent to which it can be retained reused revised remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law56 unlike free content and content under opensource licenses there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as open content the 5rs are put forward on the open content project website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open this broader definition distinguishes open content from opensource software since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public however it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses5758 in 2003 david wiley announced that the open content project had been succeeded by creative commons and their licenses wiley joined as director of educational licenses5960 in 2005 the open icecat project was launched in which product information for ecommerce applications was created and published under the open content license it was embraced by the tech sector which was already quite open source minded in 2006 a creative commons successor project the definition of free cultural works was introduced for free content61 it was put forth by erik mller richard stallman lawrence lessig benjamin mako hill angela beesley and others62 the definition of free cultural works is used by the wikimedia foundation63 in 2009 the attribution and attributionsharealike creative commons licenses were marked as approved for free cultural works64 another successor project is the open knowledge foundation founded by rufus pollock in cambridge in 200465 as a global nonprofit network to promote and share open content and data66 in 2007 the okf gave an open knowledge definition for content such as music films books data be it scientific historical geographic or otherwise government and other administrative information67 in october 2014 with version 20 open works and open licenses were defined and open is described as synonymous to the definitions of openfree in the open source definition the free software definition and the definition of free cultural works68 a distinct difference is the focus given to the public domain open access and readable open formats okf recommends six conformant licenses three of okns open data commons public domain dedication and licence open data commons attribution license open data commons open database license and the cc by cc bysa and cc0 creative commons licenses697071
