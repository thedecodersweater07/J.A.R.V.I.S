the december 2015 hindu kush earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6313 in south asia on 25 december 20154 one woman was killed in pakistan at least 100 people were injured in pakistan and afghanistan5 the quake was also strongly felt in tajikistan and india the epicenter of the earthquake was in the afghanistantajikistan border region at a depth of 2034 km6 an earthquake of 73 mw was felt in the same region7 in october 2015 causing 398 deaths and 2536 injuries in pakistan8 and afghanistan9 the himalayan mountains are pushed up by the collision of tectonic plates making them prone to devastating quakes an earthquake in april 2015 nepals worst in 80 years killed over 8600 people10 the last major earthquake in the same region of similar magnitude 76 mw was almost ten years prior in october 2005 which resulted in 87351 deaths 75266 injured 28 million people being displaced and 250000 farm animals deaths the notable difference between this earthquake and the 2005 earthquake is the depth of the seismic activity the 2005 earthquake was 15 km deep while this earthquake was 2034 km deep reducing its effects at the surface11 in recent studies geologists claim that global warming is one of the reasons for increased seismic activity according to these studies melting glaciers and rising sea levels disturb the balance of pressure on earths tectonic plates thus causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes this could be one of the reasons why the himalayas are getting more prone to earthquakes in recent years12better source needed
