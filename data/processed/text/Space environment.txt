space environment is a branch of astronautics aerospace engineering and space physics that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft a related subject space weather deals with dynamic processes in the solarterrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft but that can also affect the atmosphere ionosphere and geomagnetic field giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies effects on spacecraft can arise from radiation space debris and meteoroid impact upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging various mitigation strategies have been adopted radiation in space usually comes from three main sources for longduration missions the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells a major concern is also radiationinduced singleevent effects such as singleevent upset crewed missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the international space station is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts during solar energetic events solar flares and coronal mass ejections particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the earth in times as short as 30 minutes but usually take some hours these particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage disruption to logic circuits and even hazards to astronauts crewed missions to return to the moon or to travel to mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety in addition to the important contribution to doses from the lowlevel background cosmic rays in nearearth orbits the earths magnetic field screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards a process called geomagnetic shielding space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds causing mechanical or electrical damage the average speed of space debris is 10 kms 22000 mph 36000 kmh1 while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater for example the meteoroids associated with the perseid meteor shower travel at an average speed of 58 kms 130000 mph 210000 kmh2 mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including ldef which had over 20000 documented impacts through its 57year mission3 electrical anomalies associated with impact events include esas olympus spacecraft which lost attitude control during the 1993 perseid meteor shower4 a similar event occurred with the landsat 5 spacecraft5 during the 2009 perseid meteor shower6 spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot plasma environment around the earth the plasma encountered in the region of the geostationary orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic substorms caused by disturbances in the solar wind hot electrons with energies in the kiloelectron volt range collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts as a result discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies solutions devised by scientists and engineers include but are not limited to spacecraft shielding special hardening of electronic systems various collision detection systems evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment including radiation belt models spacecraftplasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentry the field often overlaps with the disciplines of astrophysics atmospheric science space physics and geophysics albeit usually with an emphasis on application the united states government maintains a space weather prediction center at boulder colorado the space weather prediction center swpc is part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa swpc is one of the national weather services nws national centers for environmental prediction ncep environmental law in space law is being considered but lacks establishment7 but has become an issue in light of increased space debris8 space environmentalism is an advocacy that sees space as not devoid of needing regulation and protection and has gained attention by an increasing number of academics9 such as moriba jah10
