intraplate deformation is the folding breaking or flow of the earths crust within plates instead of at their margins this process usually occurs in areas with especially weak crust and upper mantle such as the tibetan plateau figure 1 intraplate deformation brings another aspect to plate tectonic theory the theory of plate tectonics states that the earths lithosphere crust and upper mantle is made up of rigid plates that float on top of the asthenosphere lower mantle and move relative to one another as the plates move the crust deforms dominantly along the plate margins intraplate deformation differs from that respect by the observation that deformation can occur anywhere the crust is weak and not just at plate margins deformation is the folding breaking or flow of rocks there are many different types of crustal deformation depending on whether the rocks are brittle or ductile the aspects that determine these properties are due to certain temperatures and pressures that rocks experience within the earth therefore temperature and pressure control deformation processes ductile rocks tend to bend fold stretch or flow due to compressional or extensional forces brittle rocks on the other hand tend to break the zone where the crust breaks is termed a fault there are three main types of faults1 normal faults reverse faults and strike slip transform faults all of these are ways the crust can deform is due to the different types of plate margins which are2 divergent boundaries convergent boundaries and transform boundaries these three boundaries do not always form perfectly and this can lead to a mixed boundary mixed boundaries can be a combination of a transform with convergence or a transform with divergence centraleast asia is possibly the best example of largescale intraplate deformation the formation and uplift of the tibetan plateau and the himalayan mountain range started in the cenozoic era around 50 million years ago when the indian plate collided with the eurasian plate3 the collision caused much shortening of the lithosphere adding to increased crustal thickness and high stress in the himalayatibet region3 many geophysical observations in tibet show a weak crustal zone and suggest that the middle to lower crust may contain fluids and be partially melted4 as the himalayantibet region began to rise lateral extrusion of the crust in the tibetan plateau gradually became the dominant mechanism for accommodating the collision and crustal shortening4 the lateral extrusion is sliding dominantly to the east and out of indias path eastern tibet is traditionally interpreted as being part of a broad accommodation zone5 much of the eastern movement is due to major strikeslip faults6 these strikeslip faults along with the other faults in tibet could still be interpreted as on a plate margin though true intraplate deformation occurs farther north in areas such as mongolia or the tian shan mountains these areas display true intraplate deformation because there is still much faulting and folding to accommodate some of the crustal shortening from the indiaeurasia collision hundreds of kilometers away from the plate margin
