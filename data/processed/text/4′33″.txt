433a is a modernist compositionb by american experimental composer john cage it was composed in 1952 for any instrument or combination of instruments the score instructs performers not to play their instruments throughout the three movements it is divided into three movementsc lasting 30 seconds 2 minutes and 23 seconds and 1 minute and 40 seconds respectivelyd although cage later stated that the movements durations can be determined by the musician as suggested by the title the composition lasts 4 minutes and 33 seconds it is marked by silence except for ambient sound which is intended to contribute to the performance 433 was conceived around 194748 while cage was working on the piano cycle sonatas and interludes many prior musical pieces were largely composed of silence and silence played a notable role in his prior work including sonatas and interludes his studies on zen buddhism during the late 1940s about chance music led him to acknowledge the value of silence in providing an opportunity to reflect on ones surroundings and psyche recent developments in contemporary art also bolstered cages understanding on silence which he increasingly began to perceive as impossible after rauschenbergs white painting was first displayed 433 premiered in 1952 and was met with shock and widespread controversy many musicologists revisited the very definition of music and questioned whether cages work qualified as such in fact cage intended 433 to be experimentalto test the audiences attitude to silence and prove that any auditory experience may constitute music seeing that absolute silencee cannot exist although 433 is labelled as four minutes and thirtythree seconds of silence cage maintains that the ambient noises heard during the performance contribute to the composition since this counters the conventional involvement of harmony and melody in music many musicologists consider 433 to be the birth of noise music and some have likened it to dadaist art 433 also embodies the idea of musical indeterminacy as the silence is subject to the individuals interpretation thereby one is encouraged to explore their surroundings and themselves as stipulated by lacanianism 433 greatly influenced modernist music furthering the genres of noise music and silent music whichwhilst still controversial to this dayreverberate among many contemporary musicians cage reexplored the idea of silent composition in two later renditions 000 1962 and one3 1989 in a 1982 interview and on numerous other occasions he stated that 433 was his most important work8 the new grove dictionary of music and musicians describes 433 as cages most famous and controversial creation in 2013 dale eisinger of complex ranked the composition eighth in his list of the greatest performance art works9 the first time cage mentioned the idea of a piece composed entirely of silence was during a 1947 or 1948 lecture at vassar college a composers confessions at this time he was working on the cycle for piano sonatas and interludes10 cage told the audience that he had several new desires one of which was to compose a piece of uninterrupted silence and sell it to muzak co it will be three or fourandahalf minutes longthose being the standard lengths of canned music and its title will be silent prayer it will open with a single idea which i will attempt to make as seductive as the color and shape and fragrance of a flower the ending will approach imperceptibility11 prior to this silence had played a major role in several of cages works composed before 433 the duet for two flutes 1934 composed when cage was 22 opens with silence and silence was an important structural element in some of the sonatas and interludes 194648 music of changes 1951 and two pastorales 1951 the concerto for prepared piano and orchestra 1951 closes with an extended silence and waiting 1952 a piano piece composed just a few months before 433 consists of long silences framing a single short ostinato pattern furthermore in his songs the wonderful widow of eighteen springs 1942 and a flower 1950 cage directs the pianist to play a closed instrument which may be understood as a metaphor of silence12 however at the time of its conception cage felt that a fully silent piece would be incomprehensible and was reluctant to write it down i didnt wish it to appear even to me as something easy to do or as a joke i wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it13 painter alfred leslie recalls cage presenting a oneminuteofsilence talk in front of a window during the late 1940s while visiting studio 35 at new york university14 although he was a pioneer of silent music cage was not the first to compose it others especially in the first half of the twentieth century had already published related work which possibly influenced cage as early as 1907 ferruccio busoni delineated the importance of silence in music what comes closest to its original essence in our musical art today are the pause and fermata great performance artists and improvisers know how to use this expressive tool to a greater and more extensive extent the exciting silence between two movementsin this environment itself musicis more suggestive than the more definite but less flexible sound15 an example is the funeral march for the obsequies of a deaf man in french marche funbre compose pour les funrailles dun grand homme sourd 1897 by alphonse allais consisting of 24 empty measures16 allais was a companion of his fellow composer erik satie17 and since cage admired the latter the funeral march may have motivated him to compose 433 but he later wrote that he was not aware of allais work at the time18 silent compositions of the twentieth century preceding cages include the in futurum movement from the fnf pittoresken 1919 by erwin schulhoffsolely comprising rests19 and yves kleins monotonesilence symphony 1949 in which the second and fourth movements are bare twenty minutes of silence17 similar ideas had been envisioned in literature for instance harold actons prose fable cornelian 1928 mentions a musician conducting performances consisting largely of silence2021 in 1947 jazz musician dave tough joked that he was writing a play in which a string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written its made up entirely of rests suddenly the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin lout he screams you played that last measure wrong22 since the late 1940s cage had been studying zen buddhism especially through japanese scholar daisetz suzuki who introduced the field to the western world thereon he connected sounds in silence to the notions of unimpededness and interpenetration23 in a 19511952 lecture he defined unimpededness as seeing that in all of space each thing and each human being is at the center and interpenetration as the view that each one of the things and humans at the center is moving out in all directions penetrating and being penetrated by every other one no matter what the time or what the space concluding that each and every thing in all of time and space is related to each and every other thing in all of time and space24 cage believed that sounds existed in a state of unimpededness as each one is not hindered by the other due to them being isolated by silence but also that they interpenetrate each other since they work in tandem with each other and interact with the silence hence he thought that music is intrinsically an alternation between sound and silence especially after his visit to harvard universitys anechoic chamber25 he increasingly began to see silence as an integral part of music since it allows for sounds to exist in the first placeto interpenetrate each other the prevalence of silence in a composition also allowed the opportunity for contemplation on ones psyche and surroundings reflecting the zen emphasis on meditation music as means to soothe the mind26 as he began to realize the impossibility of absolute silence cage affirmed the psychological significance of lack of sound in a musical composition ive thought of music as a means of changing the mind in being themselves sounds open the minds of people who made them or listened to them to other possibilities than they had previously considered27 in 1951 cage composed the concerto for prepared piano and chamber orchestra which can be seen as a representation of the concept of interpenetration2528further explanation needed cage also explored the concept of chance musica composition without melodic structure or regular notation26 the aforementioned concerto for prepared piano employs the concepts posited in the ancient chinese text i ching29further explanation needed in 1951 cage visited the anechoic chamber at harvard university cage entered the chamber expecting to hear silence but he later wrote i heard two sounds one high and one low when i described them to the engineer in charge he informed me that the high one was my nervous system in operation the low one my blood in circulation30 cage had gone to a place where he expected total silence and yet heard sound until i die there will be sounds and they will continue following my death one need not fear about the future of music31 the realization as he saw it of the impossibility of silence led to the composition of 433 another cited influence for this piece came from the field of the visual arts13 cages friend and sometimes colleague robert rauschenberg had produced in 1951 a series of white paintings collectively named white painting seemingly blank canvases though painted with white house paint that in fact change according to varying light conditions in the rooms in which they were hung the shadows of people in the room and so on this inspired cage to use a similar idea as he later stated actually what pushed me into it was not guts but the example of robert rauschenberg his white paintings when i saw those i said oh yes i must otherwise im lagging otherwise music is lagging32 in an introduction to an article on robert rauschenberg artist and his works john cage writes to whom it may concern the white paintings came first my silent piece came later33 they missed the point theres no such thing as silence what they thought was silence because they didnt know how to listen was full of accidental sounds you could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement during the second raindrops began pattering the roof and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out the premiere of the threemovement 433 was given by david tudor on august 29 1952 in maverick concert hall woodstock new york as part of a recital of contemporary piano music the audience saw him sit at the piano and to mark the beginning of the piece close the keyboard lid some time later he opened it briefly to mark the end of the first movement this process was repeated for the second and third movementsf although the audience was enthusiastic about contemporary art the premiere was met with widespread controversy and scandal34 such that calvin tomkins notes the woodstock audience considered the piece either a joke or an affront and this has been the general reaction of most people who have heard it or heard of it ever since some listeners have been unaware they were hearing it at all35 music critic kyle gann called the piece one of the most misunderstood pieces of music ever written and yet at times one of the avantgardes best understood as well he dismissed the idea that 433 was a joke or a hoax wrote that the theory of dada and theater have some justification and said that for him the composition is a thought experiment he concluded that the idea that 433 is a zen practice may be the most directly fertile suggestion36 the composition is an indispensable contribution to the modernist movement3738 and formalized noise music as a genre3940 noise music is seen as the anathema to the traditional view of harmony in music exploiting random sound patterns noise in the process of making musicthe detritus of the music process41 paul hegarty notes that the silence of the pianist in 433 can be understood as the traditional silence of the audience so that it can appreciate the music being played music itself is sacrificed sacrificed to the musicality of the world42 for hegarty 433 is made up of incidental sounds that represent perfectly the tension between desirable sound properly played musical notes and undesirable noise that make up all noise music42 it is made of three movements3738further explanation needed 433 challenges or rather exploits to a radical extent the social regiments of the modern concert life etiquette experimenting on unsuspecting concertgoers to prove an important point first the choice of a prestigious venue and the social status of the composer and the performers automatically heightens audiences expectations for the piece as a result the listener is more focused giving cages 433 the same amount of attention or perhaps even more as if it were beethovens ninth symphony43 thus even before the performance the reception of the work is already predetermined by the social setup of the concert furthermore the audiences behavior is limited by the rules and regulation of the concert hall they will quietly sit and listen to 433 of ambient noise it is not easy to get a large group of people to listen to ambient noise for nearly five minutes unless they are regulated by the concert hall etiquette the second point made by 433 concerns duration according to cage duration is the essential building block of all of music this distinction is motivated by the fact that duration is the only element shared by both silence and sound as a result the underlying structure of any musical piece consists of an organized sequence of time buckets44 they could be filled with either sounds silence or noise where neither of these elements is absolutely necessary for completeness in the spirit of his teacher schoenberg cage managed to emancipate the silence and the noise to make it an acceptable or perhaps even an integral part of his music composition 433 serves as a radical and extreme illustration of this concept asking that if the time buckets are the only necessary parts of the musical composition then what stops the composer from filling them with no intentional sounds45 the third point is that the work of music is defined not only by its content but also by the behavior it elicits from the audience43 in the case of igor stravinskys rite of spring this would consist of widespread dissatisfaction leading up to violent riots46 in cages 433 the audience felt cheated by having to listen to no composed sounds from the performer nevertheless in 433 the audience contributed the bulk of the musical material of the piece since the piece consists of exclusively ambient noise the audiences behavior their whispers and movements are essential elements that fill the abovementioned time buckets47 above all 433in fact more of an experiment than a compositionis intended to question the very notion of music cage believed that silence is a real note and will henceforth designate all the sounds not wanted by the composer48 he had the ambition to go beyond what is achievable on a piece of paper by leaving the musical process to chance inviting the audience to closely monitor the ambient noises characterizing the piece48 french musicologist daniel charles proposes a related theory 433 isresulting from the composers lack of interference in the piecea happening since during the performance the musician is more of an actor than a musician per se4950 he also notes that it resembles a duchampstyle found object due to the fact that it creates art from objects that do not serve an artistic function as silence is often associated with the opposite of music5051 in fact cages composition draws parallels to the dadaist movement due to the involvement of antiart objects into art music its apparent nonsensical nature and blatant defiance of the status quo5253 the perceived silence characterizing cages composition is not actually silence but the interference of the ambient sounds made by the audience and environment8 to him any auditory experience containing some degree of sound and hence can be considered music54 countering its frequent label as four minutes thirtythree seconds of silence5556 the lacanian approach implies a profound psychological connection to 433 as the individual is invited to ponder their surroundings and psyche57 in a 2013 ted talk psychologist paul bloom put forward 433 as one example to show that knowing about the origin of something influences how one formulates an opinion on it in this case one can deem the five minutes of silence in cages composition as different than five minutes of ordinary silence as in a library as they know where this silence originates hence they can feel motivated to pay to listen to 433 even though it is inherently no different than five minutes of ordinary silence5859 some musicologists have argued that 433 is an example of surrealist automatism since the romantic era composers have been striving to produce music that could be separated from any social connections transcending the boundaries of time and space in automatism composers and artists strive to eliminate their role in the creation of work motivated by the belief that selfexpression always includes the infiltration of the social standardsthat the individual including the musician is subjected to from birthin artistic truth the message the musician wishes to convey4560 therefore the only method by which the listener can realize artistic truth involves the separation of the musician from their work in 433 the composer has no impact in his work as cage cannot control the ambient sounds detected by the audience hence the composition is automatic since the musician has no involvement in how the listener interprets it45 a pioneer of musical indeterminacy cage defined it as the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways61 several versions of the score exist34 the four below are the main samples that could be identified their shared quality is the compositions duration of four minutes and thirtythree secondsreflected in the title 43362 but there is some discrepancy between the lengths of individual movements specified in different versions of the scoregh the causes of this discrepancy are not currently understood34 the original woodstock manuscript august 1952 is written in conventional notation and dedicated to david tudor the first to perform the piece it is currently lost but tudor did attempt to recreate the original score reproduced in william fettermans book john cages theatre pieces notations and performances66 the reproduction notes that 433 can be performed for any instrument or combination of instruments regarding tempo it includes a treble clef staff with a 44 time signature and the beginning of each sentence is identified with roman numerals and a scale indication 60 quarter 12inch at the end of each sentence there is information about each movements duration in minutes and seconds these are i 30 seconds ii 2 minutes 23 seconds and iii 1 minute 40 seconds67 tudor commented its important that you read the score as youre performing it so there are these pages you use so you wait and then turn the page i know it sounds very straight but in the end it makes a difference68 the kremen manuscript 1953 is written in graphic spacetime notationwhich cage dubbed proportional notationand dedicated to the american artist irwin kremen the movements of the piece are rendered as space between long vertical lines a tempo indication is provided 60 and at the end of each movement the time is indicated in minutes and seconds in page 4 the note 1 page 7 inches 56 is included the same instructions timing and indications to the reproduced woodstock manuscript are implemented6970 the socalled first tacet edition or typed tacet edition 1960 is a typewritten score originally printed in edition peters as ep no 677762 it lists the three movements using roman numbers with the word tacet underneath each a note by cage describes the first performance and mentions that the work may be performed by any instrumentalist or combination of instrumentalists and last any length of time in doing so cage not only regulates the reading of the score but also determines the identity of the composition7172 conversely to the initial two manuscripts cage notes that the premiere organized the movements into the following durations 33 240 and 120 and adds that their length must be found by chance performance7371 the first tacet edition is described in michael nymans book experimental music cage and beyond but is not reproduced74 the socalled second tacet edition or calligraphic tacet edition 1986 is the same as the first except that it is printed in cages calligraphy and the explanatory note mentions the kremen manuscript75 it is also classified as ep no 6777 ie it carries the same catalog number as the first tacet edition62 additionally a facsimile reduced in size of the kremen manuscript appeared in july 1967 in source 1 no 24654 in 1962 cage wrote 000 which is also referred to as 433 no 2 the directions originally consisted of one sentence in a situation provided with maximum amplification perform a disciplined action76 at the first performance cage had to write that sentence the second performance added four new qualifications to the directions the performer should allow any interruptions of the action the action should fulfill an obligation to others the same action should not be used in more than one performance and should not be the performance of a musical composition77 in late 1989 three years before his death cage revisited the idea of 433 one last time he composed one3 the full title of which is one3 433 000 as in all of the number pieces one refers to the number of performers required the score instructs the performer to build a sound system in the concert hall so that the whole hall is on the edge of feedback without actually feeding back the content of the piece is the electronically amplified sound of the hall and the audience78 in july 2002 cages heirs sued british singersongwriter mike batt for plagiarism for the song a one minute silence literally a minute of silence to support his crossover ensemble the planets he inserted a oneminute pause in their february 2002 album classical graffiti under the authorship battcage79 supposedly to honor the composer he was then sued by the mechanical copyright protection society for plagiarizing cages silence 43379 initially batt said he would defend himself against these accusations stating that a one minute silence was a much better silent piece and that he was able to say in one minute what cage could only say in four minutes and 33 seconds80 he eventually reached an outofcourt settlement with the composers heirs in september 2002 and paid what was described at the time as a sixfigure sum in compensation6081 however in december 2010 batt admitted that the alleged legal dispute had been a publicity stunt and that he had actually only made a donation of 1000 to the john cage foundation81 in the week leading up to christmas 2010 a facebook page was created to encourage residents of the united kingdom to buy a new rendition of 43382 in the hope that it would prevent the winner of the seventh series of the x factor matt cardle from topping the uk singles chart and becoming the christmas number one83 the page was inspired by a similar campaign the year prior in which a facebook page set up by english radio dj jon morter and his thenwife tracey prompting people to buy rage against the machines killing in the name in the week before christmas 2009 to make it the christmas number one84 hence the 433 campaign was dubbed cage against the machine8586 the creators of the facebook page hoped that reaching number one would promote cages composition and make december 25 a silent night87 the campaign received support from several celebrities it first came into prominence after science writer ben goldacre mentioned it on his twitter profile88 despite many similar campaigns occurring that year the guardian journalist tom ewing considered cage against the machine the only effort this year with a hope of reaching number one89 xfm dj eddy templemorris and the guardian journalist luke bainbridge also voiced their support9091 ultimately the rendition of 433 failed to reach number one only peaking at number 21 on the charts the winning song of x factor instead became christmas number one of 20109293 due to its unique avantgarde style many musicians and groups have performed 433 featuring in several works such as albums audio apps
