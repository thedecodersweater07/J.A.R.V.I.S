mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines and mechanisms that may involve force and movement it is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design analyze manufacture and maintain mechanical systems1 it is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics dynamics thermodynamics materials science design structural analysis and electricity in addition to these core principles mechanical engineers use tools such as computeraided design cad computeraided manufacturing cam computeraided engineering cae and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants industrial equipment and machinery heating and cooling systems transport systems motor vehicles aircraft watercraft robotics medical devices weapons and others23 mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the industrial revolution in europe in the 18th century however its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world in the 19th century developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science the field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites mechatronics and nanotechnology it also overlaps with aerospace engineering metallurgical engineering civil engineering structural engineering electrical engineering manufacturing engineering chemical engineering industrial engineering and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering specifically with biomechanics transport phenomena biomechatronics bionanotechnology and modelling of biological systems the application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies the six classic simple machines were known in the ancient near east the wedge and the inclined plane ramp were known since prehistoric times4 mesopotamian civilization is credited with the invention of the wheel by several mainly old sources567 however some recent sources either suggest that it was invented independently in both mesopotamia and eastern europe or credit prehistoric eastern europeans with the invention of the wheel891011 the lever mechanism first appeared around 5000 years ago in the near east where it was used in a simple balance scale12 and to move large objects in ancient egyptian technology13 the lever was also used in the shadoof waterlifting device the first crane machine which appeared in mesopotamia circa 3000 bc12 the earliest evidence of pulleys date back to mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium bc14 the saqiyah was developed in the kingdom of kush during the 4th century bc it relied on animal power reducing the tow on the requirement of human energy15 reservoirs in the form of hafirs were developed in kush to store water and boost irrigation16 bloomeries and blast furnaces were developed during the seventh century bc in meroe17181920 kushite sundials applied mathematics in the form of advanced trigonometry2122 the earliest practical waterpowered machines the water wheel and watermill first appeared in the persian empire in what are now iraq and iran by the early 4th century bc23 in ancient greece the works of archimedes 287212 bc influenced mechanics in the western tradition the geared antikythera mechanisms was an analog computer invented around the 2nd century bc24 in roman egypt heron of alexandria c 1070 ad created the first steampowered device aeolipile25 in china zhang heng 78139 ad improved a water clock and invented a seismometer and ma jun 200265 ad invented a chariot with differential gears the medieval chinese horologist and engineer su song 10201101 ad incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock tower two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval european clocks he also invented the worlds first known endless powertransmitting chain drive26 the cotton gin was invented in india by the 6th century ad27 and the spinning wheel was invented in the islamic world by the early 11th century28 dualroller gins appeared in india and china between the 12th and 14th centuries29 the worm gear roller gin appeared in the indian subcontinent during the early delhi sultanate era of the 13th to 14th centuries30 during the islamic golden age 7th to 15th century muslim inventors made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology aljazari who was one of them wrote his famous book of knowledge of ingenious mechanical devices in 1206 and presented many mechanical designscitation needed in the 17th century important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in england and the continent the dutch mathematician and physicist christiaan huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1657 which was the first reliable timekeeper for almost 300 years and published a work dedicated to clock designs and the theory behind them3132 in england isaac newton formulated his laws of motion and developed calculus which would become the mathematical basis of physics newton was reluctant to publish his works for years but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues such as edmond halley gottfried wilhelm leibniz who earlier designed a mechanical calculator is also credited with developing the calculus during the same time period33 during the early 19th century industrial revolution machine tools were developed in england germany and scotland this allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering they brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them34 the first british professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 institution of mechanical engineers thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society institution of civil engineers35 on the european continent johann von zimmermann 18201901 founded the first factory for grinding machines in chemnitz germany in 1848citation needed in the united states the american society of mechanical engineers asme was formed in 1880 becoming the third such professional engineering society after the american society of civil engineers 1852 and the american institute of mining engineers 187136 the first schools in the united states to offer an engineering education were the united states military academy in 1817 an institution now known as norwich university in 1819 and rensselaer polytechnic institute in 1825 education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science37 degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study depending on the place and university and result in a bachelor of engineering beng or be bachelor of science bsc or bs bachelor of science engineering bsceng bachelor of technology btech bachelor of mechanical engineering bme or bachelor of applied science basc degree in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering in spain portugal and most of south america where neither bs nor btech programs have been adopted the formal name for the degree is mechanical engineer and the course work is based on five or six years of training in italy the course work is based on five years of education and training but in order to qualify as an engineer one has to pass a state exam at the end of the course in greece the coursework is based on a fiveyear curriculum38 in the united states most undergraduate mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the accreditation board for engineering and technology abet to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities the abet web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 march 201439 mechanical engineering programs in canada are accredited by the canadian engineering accreditation board ceab40 and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies in australia mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as bachelor of engineering mechanical or similar nomenclature although there are an increasing number of specialisations the degree takes four years of fulltime study to achieve to ensure quality in engineering degrees engineers australia accredits engineering degrees awarded by australian universities in accordance with the global washington accord before the degree can be awarded the student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an engineering firm41 similar systems are also present in south africa and are overseen by the engineering council of south africa ecsa in india to become an engineer one needs to have an engineering degree like a btech or be have a diploma in engineering or by completing a course in an engineering trade like fitter from the industrial training institute itis to receive a iti trade certificate and also pass the all india trade test aitt with an engineering trade conducted by the national council of vocational training ncvt by which one is awarded a national trade certificate a similar system is used in nepal42 some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a master of engineering master of technology master of science master of engineering management mengmgt or mem a doctor of philosophy in engineering engd or phd or an engineers degree the masters and engineers degrees may or may not include research the doctor of philosophy includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia43 the engineers degree exists at a few institutions at an intermediate level between the masters degree and the doctoratecitation needed standards set by each countrys accreditation society are intended to provide uniformity in fundamental subject material promote competence among graduating engineers and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole engineering programs in the us for example are required by abet to show that their students can work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas44 the specific courses required to graduate however may differ from program to program universities and institutes of technology will often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into multiple classes depending on the faculty available and the universitys major areas of research the fundamental subjects required for mechanical engineering usually include mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic concepts from chemistry physics tribology chemical engineering civil engineering and electrical engineering all mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including calculus and advanced mathematical concepts including differential equations partial differential equations linear algebra differential geometry and statistics among others in addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes such as control systems robotics transport and logistics cryogenics fuel technology automotive engineering biomechanics vibration optics and others if a separate department does not exist for these subjects47 most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problemsolving experience in the united states it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one or more internships while studying though this is not typically mandated by the university cooperative education is another option research puts demand on study components that feed students creativity and innovation48 mechanical engineers research design develop build and test mechanical and thermal devices including tools engines and machines mechanical engineers typically do the following mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacturing of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries they also design powerproducing machines such as electric generators internal combustion engines and steam and gas turbines as well as powerusing machines such as refrigeration and airconditioning systems like other engineers mechanical engineers use computers to help create and analyze designs run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work engineers may seek license by a state provincial or national government the purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge realworld experience and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level once certified the engineer is given the title of professional engineer united states canada japan south korea bangladesh and south africa chartered engineer in the united kingdom ireland india and zimbabwe chartered professional engineer in australia and new zealand or european engineer much of the european union in the us to become a licensed professional engineer pe an engineer must pass the comprehensive fe fundamentals of engineering exam work a minimum of 4 years as an engineering intern ei or engineerintraining eit and pass the principles and practice or pe practicing engineer or professional engineer exams the requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the national council of examiners for engineering and surveying ncees composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all us states and territories in australia queensland and victoria an engineer must be registered as a professional engineer within the state in which they practice for example registered professional engineer of queensland or victoria rpeq or rpev respectively in the uk current graduates require a beng plus an appropriate masters degree or an integrated meng degree a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development and a peerreviewed project report to become a chartered mechanical engineer ceng mimeche through the institution of mechanical engineers ceng mimeche can also be obtained via an examination route administered by the city and guilds of london institute49 in most developed countries certain engineering tasks such as the design of bridges electric power plants and chemical plants must be approved by a professional engineer or a chartered engineer only a licensed engineer for instance may prepare sign seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval or to seal engineering work for public and private clients50 this requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation such as in the canadian provinces for example the ontario or quebecs engineer act51 in other countries such as the uk no such legislation exists however practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics independent of legislation that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion52 the total number of engineers employed in the us in 2015 was roughly 16 million of these 278340 were mechanical engineers 1728 the largest discipline by size53 in 2012 the median annual income of mechanical engineers in the us workforce was 80580 the median income was highest when working for the government 92030 and lowest in education 5709054 in 2014 the total number of mechanical engineering jobs was projected to grow 5 over the next decade55 as of 2009 the average starting salary was 58800 with a bachelors degree56 the field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below with a brief explanation and the most common application of each some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines as well as specialized subdisciplines specialized subdisciplines as used in this article are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or onthejob training than undergraduate research several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section mechanics is in the most general sense the study of forces and their effect upon matter typically engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation both elastic and plastic of objects under known forces also called loads or stresses subdisciplines of mechanics include mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering if the engineering project were the design of a vehicle statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense dynamics might be used when designing the cars engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle see hvac or to design the intake system for the engine mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics it is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid automation systems in this way machines can be automated through the use of electric motors servomechanisms and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software a common example of a mechatronics system is a cdrom drive mechanical systems open and close the drive spin the cd and move the laser while an optical system reads the data on the cd and converts it to bits integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the cd to the computer robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous unpleasant or repetitive these robots may be of any shape and size but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world to create a robot an engineer typically employs kinematics to determine the robots range of motion and mechanics to determine the stresses within the robot robots are used extensively in industrial automation engineering they allow businesses to save money on labor perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically and to ensure better quality many companies employ assembly lines of robots especially in automotive industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves outside the factory robots have been employed in bomb disposal space exploration and many other fields robots are also sold for various residential applications from recreation to domestic applications58 structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering and also civil engineering devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance structural failures occur in two general modes static failure and fatigue failure static structural failure occurs when upon being loaded having a force applied the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically depending on the criterion for failure fatigue failure occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object a microscopic crack on the surface of the object for instance will grow slightly with each cycle propagation until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure59 failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks however it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended some systems such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags are designed to break if these systems do not break failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred or when designing to prevent failure engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by asm60 to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes once theory is applied to a mechanical design physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts in the field to analyze failed parts or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering including mechanical and chemical engineering at its simplest thermodynamics is the study of energy its use and transformation through a system61 typically engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another as an example automotive engines convert chemical energy enthalpy from the fuel into heat and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer thermofluids and energy conversion mechanical engineers use thermoscience to design engines and power plants heating ventilation and airconditioning hvac systems heat exchangers heat sinks radiators refrigeration insulation and others62 drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts a technical drawing can be a computer model or handdrawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part as well as assembly notes a list of required materials and other pertinent information63 a us mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman drafting has historically been a twodimensional process but computeraided design cad programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery either manually through programmed instructions or through the use of a computeraided manufacturing cam or combined cadcam program optionally an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings however with the advent of computer numerically controlled cnc manufacturing parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings surface finishes and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering and by many other branches of engineering and architecture threedimensional models created using cad software are also commonly used in finite element analysis fea and computational fluid dynamics cfd many mechanical engineering companies especially those in industrialized nations have incorporated computeraided engineering cae programs into their existing design and analysis processes including 2d and 3d solid modeling computeraided design cad this method has many benefits including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances other cae programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include product lifecycle management plm tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads including fatigue life and manufacturability these tools include finite element analysis fea computational fluid dynamics cfd and computeraided manufacturing cam using cae programs a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost performance and other constraints no physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated instead of a relative few in addition cae analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand such as viscoelasticity complex contact between mating parts or nonnewtonian flows as mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines as seen in mechatronics multidisciplinary design optimization mdo is being used with other cae programs to automate and improve the iterative design process mdo tools wrap around existing cae processes allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day they also use sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs often finding better innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems engineering teams can access external finiteelement analysis fea expertise through ondemand platforms by submitting structured project inputssuch as cad or fea input files load cases boundary conditions and desired deliverables users receive instant quotes and connect with prequalified simulation engineers providers manage the entire workflow remotely often running simulations on cloud and gpubased infrastructure to accelerate turnaround which can be significantly faster than inhouse cpubased systems6465 this model offers scalability access to niche simulation domains like cfd or multiphysics and avoids the delays licensing burden and overhead of traditional procurement cycles it is particularly valuable for smaller teams operating under tight deadlines or limited inhouse capacity mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer cheaper and more efficient machines and mechanical systems some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below see also exploratory engineering micronscale mechanical components such as springs gears fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon glass and polymers like su8 examples of mems components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors modern cell phones gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications friction stir welding a new type of welding was discovered in 1991 by the welding institute twi the innovative steady state nonfusion welding technique joins materials previously unweldable including several aluminum alloys it plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes potentially replacing rivets current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main space shuttle external tank orion crew vehicle boeing delta ii and delta iv expendable launch vehicles and the spacex falcon 1 rocket armor plating for amphibious assault ships and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new eclipse 500 aircraft from eclipse aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses666768 composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing and subsequently finding applications for stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight susceptibility to corrosion and other undesirable factors carbon fiber reinforced composites for instance have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering electronic engineering and software engineering the discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electromechanical systems69 typical electromechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges thermocouples and pressure transducers at the smallest scales mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnologyone speculative goal of which is to create a molecular assembler to build molecules and materials via mechanosynthesis for now that goal remains within exploratory engineering areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters70 nanofilms71 and nanostructures72 among others finite element analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress strain and deflection of solid bodies it uses a mesh setup with userdefined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node the more nodes there are the higher the precision73 this field is not new as the basis of finite element analysis fea or finite element method fem dates back to 1941 but the evolution of computers has made feafem a viable option for analysis of structural problems many commercial software applications such as nastran ansys and abaqus are widely used in industry for research and the design of components some 3d modeling and cad software packages have added fea modules in the recent times cloud simulation platforms like simscale are becoming more common other techniques such as finite difference method fdm and finitevolume method fvm are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer fluid flows fluid surface interaction etc biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems such as humans animals plants organs and cells74 biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans75 biomechanics is closely related to engineering because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems some simple applications of newtonian mechanics andor materials sciences can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems in the past decade reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia the structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight76 the goal is to replace crude steel with biomaterial for structural design over the past decade the finite element method fem has also entered the biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of biomechanics fem has since then established itself as an alternative to in vivo surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia the main advantage of computational biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endoanatomical response of an anatomy without being subject to ethical restrictions77 this has led fe modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy eg biospine computational fluid dynamics usually abbreviated as cfd is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions78 with highspeed supercomputers better solutions can be achieved ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as turbulent flows initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in fullscale testing eg flight tests acoustical engineering is one of many other subdisciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics acoustical engineering is the study of sound and vibration these engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise the study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid microphone headphone or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems79 manufacturing engineering aerospace engineering automotive engineering and marine engineering are grouped with mechanical engineering at times a bachelors degree in these areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes
