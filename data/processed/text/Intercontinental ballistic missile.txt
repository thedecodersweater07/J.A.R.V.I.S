an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm is a ballistic missile with a range greater than 5500 kilometres 3400 mi1 primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads conventional chemical and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness but have never been deployed on icbms most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs allowing a single missile to carry several warheads each of which can strike a different target the united states russia china france india the united kingdom israel and north korea are the only countries known to have operational icbms pakistan is the only nucleararmed state that does not possess icbms early icbms had limited precision which made them suitable for use only against the largest targets such as cities they were seen as a safe basing option one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack attacks against military targets especially hardened ones demanded the use of a more precise crewed bomber second and thirdgeneration designs such as the lgm118 peacekeeper dramatically improved accuracy to the point where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked icbms are differentiated by having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles intermediaterange ballistic missiles irbms mediumrange ballistic missiles mrbms shortrange ballistic missiles srbms and tactical ballistic missiles the first practical design for an icbm grew out of nazi germanys v2 rocket program the liquidfueled v2 designed by wernher von braun and his team was then widely used by nazi germany from mid1944 until march 1945 to bomb british and belgian cities particularly antwerp and london under projekt amerika von brauns team developed the a910 icbm intended for use in bombing new york and other american cities initially intended to be guided by radio it was changed to be a piloted craft after the failure of operation elster the second stage of the a9a10 rocket was tested a few times in january and february 1945 after the war the us executed operation paperclip which took von braun and hundreds of other leading nazi scientists to the united states to develop irbms icbms and launchers for the us army this technology was predicted by us general of the army hap arnold who wrote in 1943 someday not too distant there can come streaking out of somewhere we wont be able to hear it it will come so fast some kind of gadget with an explosive so powerful that one projectile will be able to wipe out completely this city of washington23 after world war ii the americans and the soviets started rocket research programs based on the v2 and other german wartime designs each branch of the us military started its own programs leading to considerable duplication of effort in the soviet union rocket research was centrally organized although several teams worked on different designs the us initiated icbm research in 1946 with the rtva2 hiroc project this was a threestage effort with the icbm development not starting until the third stage however funding was cut in 1948 after only three partially successful launches of the second stage design that was used to test variations of the v2 design4 with overwhelming air superiority and truly intercontinental bombers the newly formed us air force did not take the problem of icbm development seriously things changed in 1953 with the soviet testing of their first thermonuclear weapon but it was not until 1954 that the atlas missile program was given the highest national priority the atlas a first flew on 11 june 1957 the flight lasted only about 24 seconds before the rocket exploded the first successful flight of an atlas missile to full range occurred 28 november 19585 the first armed version of the atlas the atlas d was declared operational in january 1959 at vandenberg although it had not yet flown the first test flight was carried out on 9 july 19596 and the missile was accepted for service on 1 september the titan i was another us multistage icbm with a successful launch february 5 1959 with titan i a3 unlike the atlas the titan i was a twostage missile rather than three the titan was larger yet lighter than the atlas due to the improvements in engine technology and guidance systems the titan i overtook the atlas7 in the soviet union early development was focused on missiles able to attack european targets that changed in 1953 when sergei korolev was directed to start development of a true icbm able to deliver newly developed hydrogen bombs given steady funding throughout the r7 developed with some speed the first launch took place on 15 may 1957 and led to an unintended crash 400 km 250 mi from the site the first successful test followed on 21 august 1957 the r7 flew over 6000 km 3700 mi and became the worlds first icbm8 the first strategicmissile unit became operational on 9 february 1959 at plesetsk in northwest russia9 it was the same r7 launch vehicle that placed the first artificial satellite in space sputnik on 4 october 1957 the first human spaceflight in history was accomplished on a derivative of r7 vostok on 12 april 1961 by soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin a heavily modernized version of the r7 is still used as the launch vehicle for the sovietrussian soyuz spacecraft marking more than 60 years of operational history of sergei korolyovs original rocket design the r7 and atlas each required a large launch facility making them vulnerable to attack and could not be kept in a ready state failure rates were very high throughout the early years of icbm technology human spaceflight programs vostok mercury voskhod gemini etc served as a highly visible means of demonstrating confidence in reliability with successes translating directly to national defense implications the us was well behind the soviets in the space race and so us president john f kennedy increased the stakes with the apollo program which used saturn rocket technology that had been funded by president dwight d eisenhower these early icbms also formed the basis of many space launch systems examples include r7 atlas redstone titan and proton which was derived from the earlier icbms but never deployed as an icbm the eisenhower administration supported the development of solidfueled missiles such as the lgm30 minuteman polaris and skybolt modern icbms tend to be smaller than their ancestors due to increased accuracy and smaller and lighter warheads and use solid fuels making them less useful as orbital launch vehicles the western view of the deployment of these systems was governed by the strategic theory of mutual assured destruction in the 1950s and 1960s development began on antiballistic missile systems by both the americans and soviets such systems were restricted by the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty the first successful abm test was conducted by the soviets in 1961 which later deployed a fully operational system defending moscow in the 1970s see moscow abm system the 1972 salt treaty froze the number of icbm launchers of both the americans and the soviets at existing levels and allowed new submarinebased slbm launchers only if an equal number of landbased icbm launchers were dismantled subsequent talks called salt ii were held from 1972 to 1979 and actually reduced the number of nuclear warheads held by the us and soviets salt ii was never ratified by the us senate but its terms were honored by both sides until 1986 when the reagan administration withdrew after it had accused the soviets of violating the pact in the 1980s president ronald reagan launched the strategic defense initiative as well as the mx and midgetman icbm programs china developed a minimal independent nuclear deterrent entering its own cold war after an ideological split with the soviet union beginning in the early 1960s after first testing a domestic built nuclear weapon in 1964 it went on to develop various warheads and missiles beginning in the early 1970s the liquid fuelled df5 icbm was developed and used as a satellite launch vehicle in 1975 the df5 with a range of 10000 to 12000 km 6200 to 7500 milong enough to strike the western united states and the soviet unionwas silo deployed with the first pair in service by 1981 and possibly twenty missiles in service by the late 1990s10 china also deployed the jl1 mediumrange ballistic missile with a reach of 1700 kilometres 1100 mi aboard the ultimately unsuccessful type 092 submarine11 in 1991 the united states and the soviet union agreed in the start i treaty to reduce their deployed icbms and attributed warheads as of 2016update all five of the nations with permanent seats on the united nations security council have fully operational longrange ballistic missile systems russia the united states and china also have landbased icbms the us missiles are silobased while china and russia have both silo and roadmobile df31 rt2pm2 topolm missiles israel is believed to have deployed a road mobile nuclear icbm the jericho iii which entered service in 2008 an upgraded version is in development1213 india successfully test fired agni v with a strike range of more than 5000 km 3100 mi on 19 april 2012 claiming entry into the icbm club14 the missiles actual range is speculated by foreign researchers to be up to 8000 km 5000 mi with india having downplayed its capabilities to avoid causing concern to other countries15 on 15 december 2022 first night trial of agniv was successfully carried out by sfc from abdul kalam island odisha the missile is now 20 percent lighter because the use of composite materials rather than steel material the range has been increased to 7000 km16 by 2012 there was speculation by some intelligence agencies that north korea is developing an icbm17 north korea successfully put a satellite into space on 12 december 2012 using the 32metretall 105 ft unha3 rocket the united states claimed that the launch was in fact a way to test an icbm18 see timeline of first orbital launches by country in early july 2017 north korea claimed for the first time to have tested successfully an icbm capable of carrying a large thermonuclear warhead in july 2014 china announced the development of its newest generation of icbm the dongfeng41 df41 which has a range of 12000 kilometres 7500 miles capable of reaching the united states and which analysts believe is capable of being outfitted with mirv technology19 most countries in the early stages of developing icbms have used liquid propellants with the known exceptions being the indian agniv the planned but cancelled20 south african rsa4 icbm and the now in service israeli jericho iii21 the rs28 sarmat22 russian 28 nato reporting name satan 2 is a russian liquidfueled mirvequipped superheavy thermonuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile in development by the makeyev rocket design bureau22 from 200923 intended to replace the previous r36 missile its large payload would allow for up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter ones or up to 24 hypersonic glide vehicles yu7424 or a combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures designed to defeat antimissile systems25 it was announced by the russian military as a response to the us prompt global strike26 in july 2023 north korea fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile that landed short of japanese waters the launch follows north koreas threat to retaliate against the us for alleged spy plane incursions27 the following flight phases can be distinguished2829 icbms usually use the trajectory which optimizes range for a given amount of payload the minimumenergy trajectory an alternative is a depressed trajectory which allows less payload shorter flight time and has a much lower apogee30 modern icbms typically carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs each of which carries a separate nuclear warhead allowing a single missile to hit multiple targets mirv was an outgrowth of the rapidly shrinking size and weight of modern warheads and the strategic arms limitation treaties salt i and salt ii which imposed limitations on the number of launch vehicles it has also proved to be an easy answer to proposed deployments of antiballistic missile abm systems it is far less expensive to add more warheads to an existing missile system than to build an abm system capable of shooting down the additional warheads hence most abm system proposals have been judged to be impractical the first operational abm systems were deployed in the united states during the 1970s the safeguard abm facility located in north dakota was operational from 1975 to 1976 the soviets deployed their abm1 galosh system around moscow in the 1970s which remains in service israel deployed a national abm system based on the arrow missile in 199831 but it is mainly designed to intercept shorterranged theater ballistic missiles not icbms the alaskabased united states national missile defense system attained initial operational capability in 200432 icbms can be deployed from multiple platforms the last three kinds are mobile and therefore hard to detect prior to a missile launch during storage one of the most important features of the missile is its serviceability one of the key features of the first computercontrolled icbm the minuteman missile was that it could quickly and easily use its computer to test itself after launch a booster pushes the missile and then falls away most modern boosters are solidpropellant rocket motors which can be stored easily for long periods of time early missiles used liquidfueled rocket motors many liquidfueled icbms could not be kept fueled at all times as the cryogenic fuel liquid oxygen boiled off and caused ice formation and therefore fueling the rocket was necessary before launch this procedure was a source of significant operational delay and might allow the missiles to be destroyed by enemy counterparts before they could be used to resolve this problem nazi germany invented the missile silo that protected the missile from strategic bombing and also hid fueling operations undergroundcitation needed although the ussrrussia preferred icbm designs that use hypergolic liquid fuels which can be stored at room temperature for more than a few years once the booster falls away the remaining bus releases several warheads each of which continues on its own unpowered ballistic trajectory much like an artillery shell or cannonball the warhead is encased in a coneshaped reentry vehicle and is difficult to detect in this phase of flight as there is no rocket exhaust or other emissions to mark its position to defenders the high speeds of the warheads make them difficult to intercept and allow for little warning striking targets many thousands of kilometers away from the launch site and due to the possible locations of the submarines anywhere in the world within approximately 30 minutescitation needed manywho authorities say that missiles also release aluminized balloons electronic noisemakers and other decoys intended to confuse interception devices and radarscitation needed as the nuclear warhead reenters the earths atmosphere its high speed causes compression of the air leading to a dramatic rise in temperature which would destroy it if it were not shielded in some way in one design warhead components are contained within an aluminium honeycomb substructure sheathed in a pyrolytic carbonepoxy synthetic resin composite material heat shieldcitation needed warheads are also often radiationhardened to protect against nuclear armed abms or the nearby detonation of friendly warheads one neutronresistant material developed for this purpose in the uk is threedimensional quartz phenoliccitation needed circular error probable is crucial because halving the circular error probable decreases the needed warhead energy by a factor of four accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the navigation system and the available geodetic information strategic missile systems are thought to use custom integrated circuits designed to calculate navigational differential equations thousands to millions of flops in order to reduce navigational errors caused by calculation alone these circuits are usually a network of binary addition circuits that continually recalculate the missiles position the inputs to the navigation circuit are set by a generalpurpose computer according to a navigational input schedule loaded into the missile before launch one particular weapon developed by the soviet union the fractional orbital bombardment system had a partial orbital trajectory and unlike most icbms its target could not be deduced from its orbital flight path it was decommissioned in compliance with arms control agreements which address the maximum range of icbms and prohibit orbital or fractionalorbital weapons however according to president putin russia is working on the new sarmat icbm which leverages fractional orbital bombardment conceptscitation needed to use a southern polar approach instead of flying over the northern polar regions33 it is theorized that by using that approach it could potentially avoid the american missile defense batteries in california and alaska new development of icbm technology are icbms able to carry hypersonic glide vehicles as a payload such as rs28 sarmat on 12 march 2024 india announced that it had joined a very limited group of countries which are capable of firing multiple warheads on a single icbm the announcement came after successfully testing multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle mirv technology34 russia russia russia russia russia the united states china north korea india and israel are the only countries currently known to possess landbased icbms3738 the united states currently operates 405 icbms in three usaf bases39 the only model deployed is lgm30g minutemaniii all previous usaf minuteman ii missiles were destroyed in accordance with start ii and their launch silos have been sealed or sold to the public the powerful mirvcapable peacekeeper missiles were phased out in 200540 the russian strategic rocket forces have 286 icbms able to deliver 958

flight in 1971 and was in operational service 10 years later one of the downsides of the missile was that it took between 30 and 60 minutes to fuel the dong feng 31 aka css10 is a mediumrange threestage solidpropellant intercontinental ballistic missile and is a landbased variant of the submarinelaunched jl2 the df41 or cssx10 can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads which are mirvs and has a range of approximately 1200014000 km 75008700 mi424344 the df41 deployed underground in xinjiang qinghai gansu and inner mongolia the mysterious underground subway icbm carrier systems are called the underground great wall project45 israel is believed to have deployed a road mobile nuclear icbm the jericho iii which entered service in 2008 it is possible for the missile to be equipped with a single 750 kg 1650 lb nuclear warhead or up to three mirv warheads it is believed to be based on the shavit space launch vehicle and is estimated to have a range of 4800 to 11500 km 3000 to 7100 mi12 in november 2011 israel tested an icbm believed to be an upgraded version of the jericho iii13 india has a series of ballistic missiles called agni on 19 april 2012 india successfully test fired its first agniv a threestage solid fueled missile with a strike range of more than 7500 km 4700 mi missile was testfired for the second time on 15 september 201314 on 31 january 2015 india conducted a third successful test flight of the agniv from the abdul kalam island facility the test used a canisterised version of the missile mounted over a tata truck46 on 15 december 2022 first night trial of agniv was successfully carried out by sfc from abdul kalam island odisha the missile is now 20 percent lighter because the use of composite materials rather than steel material the range has been increased to 7000 km16 united kingdom russia russia russia russia an antiballistic missile is a missile which can be deployed to counter an incoming nuclear or nonnuclear icbm icbms can be intercepted
