aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft3 it has two major and overlapping branches aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering avionics engineering is similar but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering aeronautical engineering was the original term for the field as flight technology advanced to include vehicles operating in outer space the broader term aerospace engineering has come into use4 aerospace engineering particularly the astronautics branch is often colloquially referred to as rocket science5a flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those caused by changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature with structural loads applied upon vehicle components consequently they are usually the products of various technological and engineering disciplines including aerodynamics air propulsion avionics materials science structural analysis and manufacturing the interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers each having their own specialized area of expertise7 the origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries although the work of sir george cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to the mid19th century one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics8 and a pioneer in aeronautical engineering9 cayley is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag which affect any atmospheric flight vehicle10 early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering11 some key elements like fluid dynamics were understood by 18thcentury scientists12 in december 1903 the wright brothers performed the first sustained controlled flight of a powered heavierthanair aircraft lasting 12 seconds the 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of world war i military aircraft in 1914 robert goddard was granted two us patents for rockets using solid fuel liquid fuel multiple propellant charges and multistage designs13 this would set the stage for future applications in multistage propulsion systems for outer space on march 3 1915 the us congress established the first aeronautical research administration known as the national advisory committee for aeronautics or naca14 it was the first governmentsponsored organization to support aviation research13 though intended as an advisory board upon inception the langley aeronautical laboratory became its first sponsored research and testing facility in 192015 between world wars i and ii great leaps were made in the field accelerated by the advent of mainstream civil aviation notable airplanes of this era include the curtiss jn 4 farman f60 goliath and fokker trimotor notable military airplanes of this period include the mitsubishi a6m zero supermarine spitfire and messerschmitt bf 109 from japan united kingdom and germany respectively a significant development came with the first operational jet enginepowered airplane the messerschmitt me 262 which entered service in 1944 towards the end of the second world war16 the first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in february 19584 considering the earths atmosphere and outer space as a single realm thereby encompassing both aircraft aero and spacecraft space under the newly coined term aerospace in response to the ussr launching the first satellite sputnik into space on october 4 1957 us aerospace engineers launched the first american satellite on january 31 1958 the national aeronautics and space administration was founded in 1958 after the sputnik crisis in 1969 apollo 11 the first human space mission to the moon took place it saw three astronauts enter orbit around the moon with two neil armstrong and buzz aldrin visiting the lunar surface the third astronaut michael collins stayed in orbit to rendezvous with armstrong and aldrin after their visit17 an important innovation came on january 30 1970 when the boeing 747 made its first commercial flight from new york to london this aircraft made history and became known as the jumbo jet or queen of the skies18 due to its ability to hold up to 480 passengers another significant development came in 1976 with the development of the first passenger supersonic aircraft the concorde the development of this aircraft was agreed upon by the french and british on november 29 196219 on december 21 1988 the antonov an225 mriya cargo aircraft commenced its first flight it holds the records for the worlds heaviest aircraft heaviest airlifted cargo and longest airlifted cargo of any aircraft in operational service20 on october 25 2007 the airbus a380 made its maiden commercial flight from singapore to sydney australia this aircraft was the first passenger plane to surpass the boeing 747 in terms of passenger capacity with a maximum of 853 though development of this aircraft began in 1988 as a competitor to the 747 the a380 made its first test flight in april 200521 some of the elements of aerospace engineering are2223 the basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical physics such as fluid dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations of motion for flight dynamics there is also a large empirical component historically this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere more recently advances in computing have enabled the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the behavior of the fluid reducing time and expense spent on windtunnel testing those studying hydrodynamics or hydroacoustics often obtain degrees in aerospace engineering additionally aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle subsystems including power aerospace bearings communications thermal control life support system etc and its life cycle design temperature pressure radiation velocity lifetime aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced diploma bachelors masters and phd levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities and in mechanical engineering departments at others a few departments offer degrees in spacefocused astronautical engineering some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry a background in chemistry physics computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree25 the term rocket scientist is sometimes used to describe a person of great intelligence since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability especially technically and mathematically see eg rocket science finance the term is used ironically in the expression its not rocket science to indicate that a task is simple26 strictly speaking the use of science in rocket science is a misnomer since science is about understanding the origins nature and behavior of the universe engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to solve problems and develop new technology56 the more etymologically correct version of this phrase would be rocket engineer however science and engineering are often misused as synonyms5627
