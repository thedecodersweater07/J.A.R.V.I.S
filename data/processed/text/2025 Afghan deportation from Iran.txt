the 2025 deportation of afghans from iran was a stateled mass expulsion of afghan migrants and refugees from iran while part of a broader campaign announced earlier in the year the deportations sharply accelerated in june and july 2025 following a 12day conflict between iran and israel12 the international organization for migration iom reported that over half a million afghans were expelled in a 16day period in what was described as potentially one of the largest forced movements of a population in the decade1 according to sources iran intends to expel 4 million afghans from iran as of july 2025 11 million had been expelled3 iranian authorities cited national security as the primary justification leveraging unsubstantiated claims that afghans had acted as spies for israel during the conflict45 the campaign triggered a severe humanitarian crisis at the afghanistaniran border and drew widespread condemnation for its violation of international law particularly the principle of nonrefoulement46 for four decades following decades of war and instability in afghanistan iran has hosted one of the worlds largest refugee populations7 following the talibans return to power in 2021 the number of afghans in iran was estimated to be between 4 and 6 million many of whom were undocumented78 throughout their time in iran afghans have often faced discrimination restrictions on freedom limited legal protection and human rights abuses9 over the years iran has established a pattern of mass deportations of afghan refugees from iran in the early 1990s following the collapse of the democratic republic of afghanistan in 1992 and amid growing economic and social pressures within iran afghan refugees increasingly faced systematic harassment by iranian law enforcement this pressure campaign manifested in various forms children were barred from attending public schools identity documents were confiscated and afghans lacking legal status were subjected to mass deportations physical abuse and extortion in response to the influx of refugees and to formalize their presence iranian authorities issued more than 500000 temporary registration cards to undocumented or newly arrived afghans in 1993 though initially renewable these cards were ultimately invalidated in 1996 leaving many vulnerable once again to removal by 1999 the state expelled an estimated 100000 undocumented afghans deportation campaigns often targeting both documented and undocumented residents continued sporadically a significant escalation occurred in april 2007 when iran launched an unprecedented crackdown arresting nearly 490000 afghans by june 2008 detainees were held in deportation camps often for days before being expelled reports detailed widespread abuses families were separated individuals were beaten or mistreated and many were forced to leave their homes with little to no notice1011 after the taliban takeover in august 2021 repatriations surged in 2022 about 485000 afghans deported12 2023 saw over 650000 from march 2024 to march 2025 iran deported 12 million afghans1314 the iranian government has long regarded the large afghan refugee population as a liability15 following the june 2025 iranisrael war the government intensified its antiimmigrant rhetoric blaming afghans for security failures and accusing them of espionage for israel16 iranian state media aired footage of an alleged afghan spy confessing to his activities though no supporting evidence was provided1 critics and international observers suggested that the espionage claims were a baseless pretext for fulfilling a longheld ambition to reduce the afghan population and to deflect internal dissent by scapegoating a vulnerable minority14 arafat jamal the unhcr representative for afghanistan stated perhaps the afghans are being scapegoated and some of the anger is being taken out on them5 economic pressures also played a role with irans economy suffering under international sanctions rising inflation and unemployment public calls to expel afghan refugees who were often blamed for taking jobs had increased15 on 6 june 2025 the iranian government announced a onemonth deadline for all undocumented afghan refugees to leave the country or face arrest and deportation17 the campaign accelerated dramatically after the conflict with israel the iom reported that 508426

didnt listen they threw us out like garbage6 in detention centers deportees reported beatings extortion and being denied food and water one young man stated they would beat us up they would abuse us1 there were widespread reports of officials destroying legal documents including passports and valid visas to prevent any challenge to the deportation419 the deportees were then forcibly marched onto

priority and naturally illegal nationals must return5 other officials claimed the returns would be gradual and dignified respecting their neighbors and brothers in faith23 in an early july 2025 television interview mustafa kavakebian a former iranian mp claimed that the expulsion of afghans from iran for security reasons is false while the real reason was deep western infiltration through the alleged espionage activities of french journalist catherine perezshakdam242526 on 20 july it was reported that legal proceedings were initiated against him for his claims27 the taliban leadership publicly called on iran to allow afghans to return with respect and in a gradual manner noting that the country lacked the resources to support a sudden mass influx23 the talibans prime minister hassan akhund asked iran to avoid humiliating behaviour that could lead to hatred between the two nations19 in the absence of a robust official response afghan citizens organized grassroots aid efforts in herat businessmen and residents formed convoys of private cars to transport thousands of deportees from the border for free while others provided food water and temporary shelter19 the un
