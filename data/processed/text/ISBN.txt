the international standard book number isbn is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be uniqueab publishers purchase or receive isbns from an affiliate of the international isbn agency2 a different isbn is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item for example an ebook a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different isbn but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same isbn the isbn is ten digits long if assigned before 2007 and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007c the method of assigning an isbn is nationspecific and varies between countries often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country the first version of the isbn identification format was devised in 1967 based upon the 9digit standard book numbering sbn created in 1966 the 10digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 any 9digit sbn can be converted to a 10digit isbn by prefixing it with a zero privately published books sometimes appear without an isbn the international isbn agency sometimes assigns isbns to such books on its own initiative4 a separate identifier code of a similar kind the international standard serial number issn identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers the international standard music number ismn covers musical scores the standard book number sbn is a commercial system using ninedigit code numbers to identify books in 1965 british bookseller and stationers whsmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books1 they hired consultants to work on their behalf and the system was devised by gordon foster emeritus professor of statistics at trinity college dublin5 the international organization for standardization iso technical committee on documentation sought to adapt the british sbn for international use the isbn identification format was conceived in 1967 in the united kingdom by david whitaker67 regarded as the father of the isbn8 and in 1968 in the united states by emery koltay6 who later became director of the us isbn agency r r bowker8910 the 10digit isbn format was developed by the iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 210816 the united kingdom continued to use the ninedigit sbn code until 1974 iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso technical committee 46subcommittee 9 tc 46sc 9 the iso online facility only refers back to 197811 an sbn may be converted to an isbn by prefixing the digit 0 for example the second edition of mr j g reeder returns published by hodder in 1965 has sbn 340 01381 8 where 340 indicates the publisher 01381 is the serial number assigned by the publisher and 8 is the check digit by prefixing a zero this can be converted to isbn 0340013818 the check digit does not need to be recalculated some publishers such as ballantine books would sometimes use 12digit sbns where the last three digits indicated the price of the book12 for example woodstock handmade houses had a 12digit standard book number of 345242238595 valid sbn 345242238 isbn 034524223813 and it cost us59514 since 1 january 2007 isbns have contained thirteen digits a format that is compatible with bookland european article numbers which have 13 digits3 since 2016 isbns have also been used to identify mobile games by chinas administration of press and publication15 the united states with 39 million registered isbns in 2020 was by far the biggest user of the isbn identifier in 2020 followed by the republic of korea 329582 germany 284000 china 263066 the uk 188553 and indonesia 144793 lifetime isbns registered in the united states are over 39 million as of 202016 a separate isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a publication for example an ebook audiobook paperback and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different isbn assigned to it17 12 the isbn of an electronic publication is often colloquially called eisbn1819 however no such notation is present in the documentation whether a publication is electronic or print cannot be inferred from the isbn only the isbn is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and ten digits long if assigned before 2007c3 an international standard book number consists of four parts if it is a 10digit isbn or five parts for a 13digit isbn section 5 of the international isbn agencys official user manual17 11 describes the structure of the 13digit isbn as follows a 13digit isbn can be separated into its parts prefix element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces separating the parts registration group registrant publication and check digit of a 10digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or spaces figuring out how to correctly separate a given isbn is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digitse online tools such the isbn converter provided by the library of congress and isbnbarcodeorg can assist with hyphenation and generate standard barcodes2122 isbn issuance is countryspecific in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded23 a full directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency website24 a list for a few countries is given below the isbn registration group element is a 1to5digit number that is valid within a single prefix element ie one of 978 or 97917 11 and can be separated between hyphens such as 9781 registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element many inherited from the 10 digit isbn45 the singledigit registration groups within the 978prefix element are 0 or 1 for englishspeaking countries 2 for frenchspeaking countries 3 for germanspeaking countries 4 for japan 5 for russianspeaking countries and 7 for peoples republic of china example 5digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980 for bhutan the allocated registration groups are 05 600631 65 7 8094 950989 99109989 and 999019999346 books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements47 within the 979 prefix element the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with international standard music numbers ismns but such material is not actually assigned an isbn48 the registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the united states of america 10 for france 11 for the republic of korea and 12 for italy49 the original 9digit standard book number sbn had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero to a 9digit sbn creates a valid 10digit isbn the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element cf categoryisbn agencies and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not legally required to assign an isbn although most large bookstores only handle publications that have isbns assigned to them505152 the international isbn agency maintains the details of over one million isbn prefixes and publishers in the global register of publishers53 this database is freely searchable over the internet publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements54 here are some sample isbn10 codes illustrating block length variations englishlanguage registration group elements are 0 and 1 2 of more than 220 registration group elements these two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern which allows their length to be determined as follows20 a check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the 10digit isbn is an extension of that for sbns so the two systems are compatible an sbn prefixed with a zero the 10digit isbn will give the same check digit as the sbn without the zero the check digit is base eleven and can be an integer between 0 and 9 or an x the system for 13digit isbns is not compatible with sbns and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10digit isbn so does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the 13digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain the letter x according to the 2001 edition of the international isbn agencys official user manual55 the isbn10 check digit which is the last digit of the 10digit isbn must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11 that is if xi is the ith digit then x10 must be chosen such that for example for an isbn10 of 0306406152 formally using modular arithmetic this is rendered it is also true for isbn 10s that the sum of all ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this example formally this is rendered the two most common errors in handling an isbn eg when typing it or writing it down are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid isbn 10s differ in at least two digits it can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid isbn 10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits these proofs are true because the isbn is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbnthe sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11 however if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected the book would be issued with an invalid isbn56 in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered nontransposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn although it is still unlikely each of the first nine digits of the 10digit isbnexcluding the check digit itselfis multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 2 and the sum of these nine products found the value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of 11 for example the check digit for an isbn10 of 030640615 is calculated as follows adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 because 132 1211this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so therefore the check digit has to be 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0306406152 if the value of x 10 displaystyle x10 required to satisfy this condition is 10 then an x should be used alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 the remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 ie its value modulo 11 is computed this remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11 0 11 which is invalid strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is not needed but it may be considered to simplify the calculation for example the check digit for the isbn of 030640615 is calculated as follows thus the check digit is 2 it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples the modular reduction can be done once at the end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 999999999x or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition appendix 1 of the international isbn agencys official user manual17 33 describes how the 13digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10 as isbn13 is a subset of ean13 the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both formally using modular arithmetic this is rendered the calculation of an isbn13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13digit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero replaces a ten so in all cases a single check digit results for example the isbn13 check digit of 978030640615 is calculated as follows thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 9780306406157 in general the isbn check digit is calculated as follows let then this check systemsimilar to the upc check digit formuladoes not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3 6 1 1 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3 1 1 6 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 09 to express the check digit additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 ie end in 0 a 10digit isbn is converted to a 13digit isbn by prepending 978 to the isbn10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the isbn13 algorithm the reverse process can also be performed but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978 which have no 10digit equivalent publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers57 for example isbn 0590764845 is shared by two booksninja gaiden a novel based on the bestselling game by tecmo 1990 and wacky laws 1997 both published by scholastic most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase cancelled isbn58 the international union library catalog worldcat oclconline computer library center system often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member library59 the barcodes on a books back cover or inside a massmarket paperback books front cover are ean13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an ean5 for the currency and the recommended retail price60 for 10digit isbns the number 978 the bookland country code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula modulo 10 1 and 3 weighting on alternating digits partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization iso decided to migrate to a 13digit isbn isbn13 the process began on 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 january 200761 as of 2011update all the 13digit isbns began with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn the 10digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an m letter the bar code represents the m as a zero and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now thirteen digits commencing 9790 9791 to 9799 will be used by isbn publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the 10digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the 13digit isbn check digit because the gtin13 is part of the global trade item number gtin system that includes the gtin14 the gtin12 and the gtin8 the 13digit isbn falls within the 14digit data field range62 barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the isbn13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10digit isbns so migration to an eanbased system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and nonbook products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers eg barnes noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean13 in 2005 eased migration to the isbn in north america
