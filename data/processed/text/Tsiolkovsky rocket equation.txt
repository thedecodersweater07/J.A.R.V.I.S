the classical rocket equation or ideal rocket equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of vehicles that follow the basic principle of a rocket a device that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with high velocity and can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum it is credited to konstantin tsiolkovsky who independently derived it and published it in 190312 although it had been independently derived and published by william moore in 18103 and later published in a separate book in 18134 robert goddard also developed it independently in 1912 and hermann oberth derived it independently about 1920 the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle v displaystyle delta v with no external forces acting is v v e ln m 0 m f i

konstantin tsiolkovsky who independently derived it and published it in his 1903 work12 the equation had been derived earlier by the british mathematician william moore in 18103 and later published in a separate book in 18134 american robert goddard independently developed the equation in 1912 when he began his research to improve rocket engines for possible space flight german engineer hermann oberth independently derived the equation about 1920 as he studied the feasibility of space travel while the derivation of the rocket equation is a straightforward calculus exercise tsiolkovsky is honored as being the first to apply it to the question of whether rockets could achieve speeds necessary for space travel in order to understand the principle of rocket propulsion konstantin tsiolkovsky proposed the famous experiment of the boatcitation needed a person is in a boat away from the shore without oars they want to reach this shore they notice that the boat is loaded with a certain quantity of stones and have the idea of quickly and repeatedly throwing the stones in succession in the opposite direction effectively the quantity of movement of the stones thrown in one direction corresponds to an equal quantity of movement for the boat in the other direction ignoring friction drag consider the following system in the following derivation the rocket is taken to mean

propellant expended v displaystyle delta v deltav is the integration over time of the magnitude of the acceleration produced by using the rocket engine what would be the actual acceleration if external forces were absent in free space for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity this is the increase of the speed in the case of an acceleration in opposite direction deceleration it is the decrease of the speed of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle hence deltav may not always be the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle the equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force thrust over mass by representing the

perform a maneuver such as launching from or landing on a planet or moon or an inspace orbital maneuver it is a scalar that has the units of speed as used in this context it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle deltav is produced by reaction engines such as rocket engines is proportional to the thrust per unit mass and burn time and is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given manoeuvre through the rocket equation for multiple manoeuvres deltav sums linearly for interplanetary missions deltav is often plotted on a porkchop plot which displays the required mission deltav as a function of launch date in aerospace engineering the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicles mass which does not reach the destination and is instead burned as propellant usually used as a measure of the vehicles performance in other words the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle in a spacecraft the destination is usually an orbit while for aircraft it is their landing location a higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design another related measure is the payload fraction which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload while the original wording of the tsiolkovsky rocket equation does not directly use the mass fraction the mass fraction can be derived from the used ratio of initial to final mass or m 0 m f m f m p m f m p m f 1 displaystyle frac m0mffrac mfmpmffrac mpmf1 the effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by v e g 0 i sp displaystyle vtexteg0itextsp where the rocket equation captures the essentials of rocket flight physics in a single short equation it also holds true for rocketlike reaction vehicles whenever the effective exhaust velocity is constant and can be summed or integrated when the effective exhaust velocity varies the rocket equation only accounts for the reaction force from the rocket engine it does not include other forces that may act on a rocket such as aerodynamic or gravitational forces as such when using it to calculate the propellant requirement for launch from or powered descent to a planet with an atmosphere the effects of these forces must be included in the deltav requirement see examples below in what has been called the tyranny of the rocket equation there is a limit to the amount of payload that the rocket can carry as higher amounts of propellant increment the overall weight and thus also increase the fuel consumption7 the equation does not apply to nonrocket systems such as aerobraking gun launches space elevators launch loops tether propulsion or light sails the rocket equation can be applied to orbital maneuvers in order to determine how much propellant is needed to change to a particular new orbit or to find the new orbit as the result of a particular propellant burn when applying to orbital maneuvers one assumes an impulsive maneuver in which the propellant is discharged and deltav applied instantaneously this assumption is relatively accurate for shortduration burns such as for midcourse corrections and orbital insertion maneuvers as the burn duration increases the result is less accurate due to the effect of gravity on the vehicle over the duration of the maneuver for lowthrust long duration propulsion such as electric propulsion more complicated analysis based on the propagation of the spacecrafts state vector and the integration of thrust are used to predict orbital motion assume an exhaust velocity of 4500 meters per second 15000 fts and a v displaystyle delta v of 9700 meters per second 32000 fts earth to leo including v displaystyle delta v to overcome gravity and aerodynamic drag in the case of sequentially thrusting rocket stages the equation applies for each stage where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned for each stage the specific impulse may be different for example if 80 of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage and 10 is the dry mass of the first stage and 10 is the remaining rocket then v v e ln 100 100 80 v e ln 5 161 v e

the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquidfuel stage the situation is more complicated
