the french space program includes both civil and military spaceflight activities it is the third oldest national space program in the world after the soviet now russian and american space programs and the largest space program in europe space travel has long been a significant ambition in french culture from the gobelins 1664 tapestry representing a space rocket1 to jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon and george mlis 1902 film a trip to the moon space and rocketry were present in french society long before the technological means appeared to allow the development of a space exploration program during the late 18th century jeanfranois piltre de rozier jacques charles and the montgolfier brothers are seen as worldwide precursors and explorers of aeronautics with the world record altitude then reached by a human at 7016 metres 23018 ft performed by josephlouis gaylussac in 1804 those names their numerous students and their works will mark the early expertise of frances space program in all types of air balloons since in the beginning of the twentieth century the origins of the french space program are tied to french technological developments in aerospace and astronautics notably the nascent airplane and rocket industries robert esnaultpelterie appears as one of the early pioneers in space exploration design and rocket science from 1908 he studied propulsion and space flight without knowing the work of russian mathematician konstantin tsiolkovsky at that time he derived the mathematical equations for interplanetary flight flight durations and engine propulsion and was later nominated president of the chambre syndicale des industries aronautiques trade association of aircraft industries in 19122 from 1935 to 1939 he designed a highaltitude sounding rocket but world war ii interrupted his plans german experts believed that the rocket could have reached its design goal of 60 miles 97 km3 esnaultpelterie convinced physicist jeanjacques barr a pioneer in rocket propulsion to collaborate on the design of a selfpropelled cryogenic rocket between 1927 and 1933 barr did extensive research and developed a rocket that could reach the upper atmosphere and space the ea41 eole see picture4 the beginning of the institutional french space program dates back to 1946 when right after world war ii the laboratoire de recherches balistiques et arodynamiques lrba ballistic and aerodynamic research laboratory was formed in vernon to develop the next generation of rockets partly taking advantage of the german development of the v2 rocket before this and during the war as free france continued to work the ea41 was tested and improved by military personnel from october 1942 through to 19455 22 may 1952 vronique n1 is successfully launched from the saharan desert5 in 1958 president charles de gaulle directed the creation of several space research committees in 1959 the comit dtudes spatiales was born under the supervision of pierre auger in 1961 de gaulle signed the creation of the centre national dtudes spatiales cnes to coordinate french space activities development of western europes first carrier rocket the diamant began in 1962 first launched in algeria on november 26 1965 astrix the first french satellite in space is successfully launched by a diamant rocket from the algerian desert it is active for 2 consecutive days before ceasing to transmit5 in 1965 frances space launch pads and cnes settled in kourou in 1973 france drove the creation of the european space agency and became its first contributor the french space budget although stagnant since the early 2000s in constant euros remains in absolute terms the largest of the member countries of the european space agency esa and the third largest national budget after the united states of america and the peoples republic of china at 233 billion6 in 2004 this budget stood at 1698 billion with 685 million being transferred to the parisbased esa for the programs conducted under its supervision the ariane rocket family is frances own rocket family whose use has been extended to the whole of esa member countries its spaceport near kourou was selected in 1964 to host all of frances launches later it was selected as esas launch site before being in french guiana frances space launches were made from algeria in colombbchar and hammaguir7 the french space program thus benefits from the best ground position for launch sites on earth as its position 53 north of the equator allows rockets to gain propulsion from the spinning of the earth when launched eastward 460 ms and save on propellant no other governmental launch sites allow this level of physical parameters it is also able to launch satellites into polar orbits from this spaceport although the rotational velocity becomes a penalty for sunsynchronous orbits as of 2017update kourou counts amongst the spaceports with the highest percentage of successful launches both successive and overall here is a chronology of all orbital launches from the kourou spaceport since 1970 under the french and european space programmes success failure partial failure scheduled frances public involvement in space technologies is also deep into european programs such as columbus thales alenia space or automated transfer vehicle airbus defence and space the french space program includes collaborations between its institutions and other countries european as well as other foreign countries and institutions jaxa isro nasa cnsa in projects ranging from the herschel space observatory to bepicolombo saralaltika and the planck space observatory10 since 2010 france and russia have been collaborating on several space missions including longrun science programmes like cardiomed dedicated to monitoring cardiovascular health in cosmonauts11 in 2016 for the cop21 cnes and isro impulsed a groundbreaking and worldwide plan to unite all space agencies for the gathering of satellite information and detection on greenhouse gas emissions allowing more precise measurements and decision making12 in addition cnes and esa have a strong background of collaboration notably building the largest single satellite surveyance program for earths biological monitoring copernicus programme cnes has provided essential instruments cameras on an indian mission to the moon chandrayaan1 launched in january 201813 a consortium led by the cnes also built argos instruments on board indias oceansat3 in 201814 a third collaboration between the isro and french space actors lesia cnrs universit parisvi and universit parisvii has seen the launch of picsat in january 2018 a nanosatellite that surveys the beta pictoris star for exoplanets15 the french space agency was also responsible for the construction of the main instruments on the frenchgermanamerican insight mission to mars which launched on 5 may 2018 and landed on 26 november 2018 on 20 october 2018 cnes and jaxa launched the bepicolombo mission to study the magnetic field of mercury and map its surface on 29 october 2018 the cfosat fr chinafrance oceanography satellite was placed into earth orbit to study ocean surface winds and waves16 after president macrons state visit to china in january 2018 the frenchchinese collaboration in space was increased significantly and includes more indepth collaboration notably in the sharing of cfosat data meant to study oceans and their interaction with the atmosphere as well as in the svom program17 in 2020 solar orbiter was launched by nasa containing instruments designed by cnes and other french industrial actors18 the french satellite taranis with international collaboration was launched in november 2020 the launch was a failure of the launching rocket and the satellite never entered use it would have been the 1st satellite designed to observe lightning at altitudes of 20 to 100 km19 the construction of the ariane 6 launcher after being approved by all esa countries in 2016 was completed with its inaugural flight that took place on 9 july 202420 it is designed by airbus safran launchers21 2023 will mark the launch of jupiter icy moons explorer it will study jupiter and three of its moons with a view to gaining new insights into how life emerged22 this mission is a collaboration of cnes with cnrs and esa in 2025 france and germany will launch their collaborative mission merlin due to study methane levels and concentrations in the earths atmosphere2324
