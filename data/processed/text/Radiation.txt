in physics radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or a material medium12 this includes radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or nonionizing depending on the energy of the radiated particles ionizing radiation carries more than 10 electron volts ev which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds this is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms a common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit or radiation consisting of helium nuclei electrons or positrons and photons respectively other sources include xrays from medical radiography examinations and muons mesons positrons neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with earths atmosphere gamma rays xrays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum the word ionize refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply further down the spectrum the nonionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms but can disrupt the interatomic bonds that form molecules thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms a good example of this is sunburn caused by longwavelength solar ultraviolet the waves of longer wavelength than uv in visible light infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems these are not sharp delineations of the energies there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies3 the word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating ie traveling outward in all directions from a source this aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that apply to all types of radiation because such radiation expands as it passes through space and as its energy is conserved in vacuum the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inversesquare law in relation to the distance from its source like any ideal law the inversesquare law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point radiation with sufficiently high energy can ionize atoms that is to say it can knock electrons off atoms creating ions ionization occurs when an electron is stripped or knocked out from an electron shell of the atom which leaves the atom with a net positive charge because living cells and more importantly the dna in those cells can be damaged by this ionization exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer thus ionizing radiation is somewhat artificially separated from particle radiation and electromagnetic radiation simply due to its great potential for biological damage while an individual cell is made of trillions of atoms only a small fraction of those will be ionized at low to moderate radiation powers the probability of ionizing radiation causing cancer is dependent upon the absorbed dose of the radiation and is a function of the damaging tendency of the type of radiation equivalent dose and the sensitivity of the irradiated organism or tissue effective dose if the source of the ionizing radiation is a radioactive material or a nuclear process such as fission or fusion there is particle radiation to consider particle radiation is subatomic particles accelerated to relativistic speeds by nuclear reactions because of their momenta they are quite capable of knocking out electrons and ionizing materials but since most have an electrical charge they do not have the penetrating power of ionizing radiation the exception is neutron particles see below there are several different kinds of these particles but the majority are alpha particles beta particles neutrons and protons roughly speaking photons and particles with energies above about 10 electron volts ev are ionizing some authorities use 33 ev the ionization energy for water particle radiation from radioactive material or cosmic rays almost invariably carries enough energy to be ionizing most ionizing radiation originates from radioactive materials and space cosmic rays and as such is naturally present in the environment since most rocks and soil have small concentrations of radioactive materials since this radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses instruments such as geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence in some cases it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon its interaction with matter as in the case of cherenkov radiation and radioluminescence ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine research and construction but presents a health hazard if used improperly exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue high doses result in acute radiation syndrome ars with skin burns hair loss internal organ failure and death while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage a particular form of cancer thyroid cancer often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product iodine1314 however calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by populationbased data from the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and from followup of reactor accidents such as the chernobyl disaster the international commission on radiological protection states that the commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections and in particular the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided5 ultraviolet of wavelengths from 10 nm to 200 nm ionizes air molecules causing it to be strongly absorbed by air and by ozone o3 in particular ionizing uv therefore does not penetrate earths atmosphere to a significant degree and is sometimes referred to as vacuum ultraviolet although present in space this part of the uv spectrum is not of biological importance because it does not reach living organisms on earth there is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98 of nonionizing but dangerous uvc and uvb this ozone layer starts at about 20 miles 32 km and extends upward some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground is nonionizing but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions an example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in dna which begins at wavelengths below 365 nm 34 ev which is well below ionization energy this property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring in contrast visible light and longerwavelength electromagnetic radiation such as infrared microwaves and radio waves consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy xrays are electromagnetic waves with a wavelength less than about 109 m greater than 31017 hz and 1240 ev a smaller wavelength corresponds to a higher energy according to the equation e hc e is energy h is the planck constant c is the speed of light is wavelength when an xray photon collides with an atom the atom may absorb the energy of the photon and boost an electron to a higher orbital level or if the photon is extremely energetic it may knock an electron from the atom altogether causing the atom to ionize generally larger atoms are more likely to absorb an xray photon since they have greater energy differences between orbital electrons the soft tissue in the human body is composed of smaller atoms than the calcium atoms that make up bone so there is a contrast in the absorption of xrays xray machines are specifically designed to take advantage of the absorption difference between bone and soft tissue allowing physicians to examine structure in the human body xrays are also totally absorbed by the thickness of the earths atmosphere resulting in the prevention of the xray output of the sun smaller in quantity than that of uv but nonetheless powerful from reaching the surface gamma radiation consists of photons with a wavelength less than 31011 m greater than 1019 hz and 414 kev4 gamma radiation emission is a nuclear process that occurs to rid an unstable nucleus of excess energy after most nuclear reactions both alpha and beta particles have an electric charge and mass and thus are quite likely to interact with other atoms in their path gamma radiation however is composed of photons which have neither mass nor electric charge and as a result penetrates much further through matter than either alpha or beta radiation gamma rays can be stopped by a sufficiently thick or dense layer of material where the stopping power of the material per given area depends mostly but not entirely on the total mass along the path of the radiation regardless of whether the material is of high or low density however as is the case with xrays materials with a high atomic number such as lead or depleted uranium add a modest typically 20 to 30 amount of stopping power over an equal mass of less dense and lower atomic weight materials such as water or concrete the atmosphere absorbs all gamma rays approaching earth from space even air is capable of absorbing gamma rays halving the energy of such waves by passing through on the average 500 ft 150 m alpha particles are helium4 nuclei two protons and two neutrons they interact with matter strongly due to their charges and combined mass and at their usual velocities only penetrate a few centimetres of air or a few millimetres of low density material such as the thin mica material which is specially placed in some geiger counter tubes to allow alpha particles in this means that alpha particles from ordinary alpha decay do not penetrate the outer layers of dead skin cells and cause no damage to the live tissues below some very high energy alpha particles compose about 10 of cosmic rays and these are capable of penetrating the body and even thin metal plates however they are of danger only to astronauts since they are deflected by the earths magnetic field and then stopped by its atmosphere alpha radiation is dangerous when alphaemitting radioisotopes are inhaled or ingested breathed or swallowed this brings the radioisotope close enough to sensitive live tissue for the alpha radiation to damage cells per unit of energy alpha particles are at least 20 times more effective at celldamage than gamma rays and xrays see relative biological effectiveness for a discussion of this examples of highly poisonous alphaemitters are all isotopes of radium radon and polonium due to the amount of decay that occur in these short halflife materials betaminus radiation consists of an energetic electron it is more penetrating than alpha radiation but less than gamma beta radiation from radioactive decay can be stopped with a few centimetres of plastic or a few millimetres of metal it occurs when a neutron decays into a proton in a nucleus releasing the beta particle and an antineutrino beta radiation from linac accelerators is far more energetic and penetrating than natural beta radiation it is sometimes used therapeutically in radiotherapy to treat superficial tumors betaplus radiation is the emission of positrons which are the antimatter form of electrons when a positron slows to speeds similar to those of electrons in the material the positron will annihilate an electron releasing two gamma photons of 511 kev in the process those two gamma photons will be traveling in approximately opposite directions the gamma radiation from positron annihilation consists of high energy photons and is also ionizing neutrons are categorized according to their speedenergy neutron radiation consists of free neutrons these neutrons may be emitted during either spontaneous or induced nuclear fission neutrons are rare radiation particles they are produced in large numbers only where chain reaction fission or fusion reactions are active this happens for about 10 microseconds in a thermonuclear explosion or continuously inside an operating nuclear reactor production of the neutrons stops almost immediately in the reactor when it goes noncritical neutrons can make other objects or material radioactive this process called neutron activation is the primary method used to produce radioactive sources for use in medical academic and industrial applications even comparatively low speed thermal neutrons cause neutron activation in fact they cause it more efficiently neutrons do not ionize atoms in the same way that charged particles such as protons and electrons do by the excitation of an electron because neutrons have no charge it is through their absorption by nuclei which then become unstable that they cause ionization hence neutrons are said to be indirectly ionizing even neutrons without significant kinetic energy are indirectly ionizing and are thus a significant radiation hazard not all materials are capable of neutron activation in water for example the most common isotopes of both types atoms present hydrogen and oxygen capture neutrons and become heavier but remain stable forms of those atoms only the absorption of more than one neutron a statistically rare occurrence can activate a hydrogen atom while oxygen requires two additional absorptions thus water is only very weakly capable of activation the sodium in salt as in sea water on the other hand need only absorb a single neutron to become na24 a very intense source of beta decay with a halflife of 15 hours in addition highenergy highspeed neutrons have the ability to directly ionize atoms one mechanism by which high energy neutrons ionize atoms is to strike the nucleus of an atom and knock the atom out of a molecule leaving one or more electrons behind as the chemical bond is broken this leads to production of chemical free radicals in addition very high energy neutrons can cause ionizing radiation by neutron spallation or knockout wherein neutrons cause emission of highenergy protons from atomic nuclei especially hydrogen nuclei on impact the last process imparts most of the neutrons energy to the proton much like one billiard ball striking another the charged protons and other products from such reactions are directly ionizing highenergy neutrons are very penetrating and can travel great distances in air hundreds or even thousands of metres and moderate distances several metres in common solids they typically require hydrogen rich shielding such as concrete or water to block them within distances of less than 1 m a common source of neutron radiation occurs inside a nuclear reactor where a metresthick water layer is used as effective shielding there are two sources of high energy particles entering the earths atmosphere from outer space the sun and deep space the sun continuously emits particles primarily free protons in the solar wind and occasionally augments the flow hugely with coronal mass ejections cme the particles from deep space inter and extragalactic are much less frequent but of much higher energies these particles are also mostly protons with much of the remainder consisting of helions alpha particles a few completely ionized nuclei of heavier elements are present the origin of these galactic cosmic rays is not yet well understood but they seem to be remnants of supernovae and especially gammaray bursts grb which feature magnetic fields capable of the huge accelerations measured from these particles they may also be generated by quasars which are galaxywide jet phenomena similar to grbs but known for their much larger size and which seem to be a violent part of the universes early history the kinetic energy of particles of nonionizing radiation is too small to produce charged ions when passing through matter for nonionizing electromagnetic radiation see types below the associated particles photons have only sufficient energy to change the rotational vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms the effect of nonionizing forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied nevertheless different biological effects are observed for different types of nonionizing radiation46 even nonionizing radiation is capable of causing thermalionization if it deposits enough heat to raise temperatures to ionization energies these reactions occur at far higher total energies than with ionization radiation which requires only single particles to cause ionization a familiar example of thermal ionization is the flameionization of a common fire and the browning reactions in common food items induced by infrared radiation during broilingtype cooking the electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation frequencies4 the electromagnetic spectrum usually just spectrum of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by or absorbed by that particular object the nonionizing portion of electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves that as individual quanta or particles see photon are not energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules and hence cause their ionization these include radio waves microwaves infrared and sometimes visible light the lower frequencies of ultraviolet light may cause chemical changes and molecular damage similar to ionization but is technically not ionizing the highest frequencies of ultraviolet light as well as all xrays and gammarays are ionizing the occurrence of ionization depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves and not on their number an intense flood of particles or waves will not cause ionization if these particles or waves do not carry enough energy to be ionizing unless they raise the temperature of a body to a point high enough to ionize small fractions of atoms or molecules by the process of thermalionization this however requires relatively extreme radiation intensities as noted above the lower part of the spectrum of ultraviolet called soft uv from 3 ev to about 10 ev is nonionizing however the effects of nonionizing ultraviolet on chemistry and the damage to biological systems exposed to it including oxidation mutation and cancer are such that even this part of ultraviolet is often compared with ionizing radiation light or visible light is a very narrow range of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye or 380750 nm which equates to a frequency range of 790 to 400 thz respectively4 more broadly physicists use the term light to mean electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths whether visible or not infrared ir light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 07 and 300 m which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 thz respectively ir wavelengths are longer than that of visible light but shorter than that of microwaves infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by feel infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads called pits bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kwm2 at sea level of this energy 53 is infrared radiation 44 is visible light and 3 is ultraviolet radiation4 microwaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths ranging from as short as 1 mm to as long as 1 m which equates to a frequency range of 300 mhz to 300 ghz this broad definition includes both uhf and ehf millimetre waves but various sources use different other limits4 in all cases microwaves include the entire super high frequency band 3 to 30 ghz or 10 to 1 cm at minimum with rf engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 ghz 30 cm and the upper around 100 ghz 3 mm radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light like all other electromagnetic waves they travel at the speed of light naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning or by certain astronomical objects artificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication broadcasting radar and other navigation systems satellite communication computer networks and innumerable other applications in addition almost any wire carrying alternating current will radiate some of the energy away as radio waves these are mostly termed interference different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the earths atmosphere long waves may bend at the rate of the curvature of the earth and may cover a part of the earth very consistently shorter waves travel around the world by multiple reflections off the ionosphere and the earth much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel along the line of sight very low frequency vlf refers to a frequency range of 30 hz to 3 khz which corresponds to wavelengths of 100000 to 10000 m respectively since there is not much bandwidth in this range of the radio spectrum only the very simplest signals can be transmitted such as for radio navigation also known as the myriametre band or myriametre wave as the wavelengths range from 100 km to 10 km an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 km extremely low frequency elf is radiation frequencies from 3 to 30 hz 108 to 107 m respectively in atmosphere science an alternative definition is usually given from 3 hz to 3 khz4 in the related magnetosphere science the lower frequency electromagnetic oscillations pulsations occurring below 3 hz are considered to lie in the ulf range which is thus also defined differently from the itu radio bands a massive military elf antenna in michigan radiates very slow messages to otherwise unreachable receivers such as submerged submarines thermal radiation is a common synonym for infrared radiation emitted by objects at temperatures often encountered on earth thermal radiation refers not only to the radiation itself but also the process by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form of blackbody radiation infrared or red radiation from a common household radiator or electric heater is an example of thermal radiation as is the heat emitted by an operating incandescent light bulb thermal radiation is generated when energy from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation as noted above even lowfrequency thermal radiation may cause temperatureionization whenever it deposits sufficient thermal energy to raise temperatures to a high enough level common examples of this are the ionization plasma seen in common flames and the molecular changes caused by the browning during foodcooking which is a chemical process that begins with a large component of ionization blackbody radiation is an idealized spectrum of radiation emitted by a body that is at a uniform temperature the shape of the spectrum and the total amount of energy emitted by the body is a function of the absolute temperature of that body the radiation emitted covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum and the intensity of the radiation powerunitarea at a given frequency is described by plancks law of radiation for a given temperature of a blackbody there is a particular frequency at which the radiation emitted is at its maximum intensity that maximum radiation frequency moves toward higher frequencies as the temperature of the body increases the frequency at which the blackbody radiation is at maximum is given by wiens displacement law and is a function of the bodys absolute temperature a blackbody is one that emits at any temperature the maximum possible amount of radiation at any given wavelength a blackbody will also absorb the maximum possible incident radiation at any given wavelength a blackbody with a temperature at or below room temperature would thus appear absolutely black as it would not reflect any incident light nor would it emit enough radiation at visible wavelengths for our eyes to detect theoretically a blackbody emits electromagnetic radiation over the entire spectrum from very low frequency radio waves to xrays creating a continuum of radiation the color of a radiating blackbody tells the temperature of its radiating surface it is responsible for the color of stars which vary from infrared through red 2500 k to yellow 5800 k to white and to bluewhite 15000 k as the peak radiance passes through those points in the visible spectrum when the peak is below the visible spectrum the body is black while when it is above the body is bluewhite since all the visible colors are represented from blue decreasing to red electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than visible light were discovered in the early 19th century the discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to william herschel the astronomer herschel published his results in 1800 before the royal society of london herschel like ritter used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared beyond the red part of the spectrum through an increase in the temperature recorded by a thermometer in 1801 the german physicist johann wilhelm ritter made the discovery of ultraviolet by noting that the rays from a prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than violet light ritters experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography ritter noted that the uv rays were capable of causing chemical reactions the first radio waves detected were not from a natural source but were produced deliberately and artificially by the german scientist heinrich hertz in 1887 using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations in the radio frequency range following formulas suggested by the equations of james clerk maxwell wilhelm rntgen discovered and named xrays while experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 november 1895 he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass within a month he discovered the main properties of xrays that we understand to this day in 1896 henri becquerel found that rays emanating from certain minerals penetrated black paper and caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate his doctoral student marie curie discovered that only certain chemical elements gave off these rays of energy she named this behavior radioactivity alpha rays alpha particles and beta rays beta particles were differentiated by ernest rutherford through simple experimentation in 18997 rutherford used a generic pitchblende radioactive source and determined that the rays produced by the source had differing penetrations in materials one type had short penetration it was stopped by paper and a positive charge which rutherford named alpha rays the other was more penetrating able to expose film through paper but not metal and had a negative charge and this type rutherford named beta this was the radiation that had been first detected by becquerel from uranium salts in 1900 the french scientist paul villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium and after he described it rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation which in 1903 rutherford named gamma rays henri becquerel himself proved that beta rays are fast electrons while rutherford and thomas royds proved in 1909 that alpha particles are ionized helium rutherford and edward andrade proved in 1914 that gamma rays are like xrays but with shorter wavelengths cosmic ray radiations striking the earth from outer space were finally definitively recognized and proven to exist in 1912 as the scientist victor hess carried an electrometer to various altitudes in a free balloon flight the nature of these radiations was only gradually understood in later years the neutron and neutron radiation were discovered by james chadwick in 1932 a number of other high energy particulate radiations such as positrons muons and pions were discovered by cloud chamber examination of cosmic ray reactions shortly thereafter and others types of particle radiation were produced artificially in particle accelerators through the last half of the twentieth century radiation and radioactive substances are used for diagnosis treatment and research xrays for example pass through muscles and other soft tissue but are stopped by dense materials this property of xrays enables doctors to find broken bones and to locate cancers that might be growing in the body8circular reference doctors also find certain diseases by injecting a radioactive substance and monitoring the radiation given off as the substance moves through the body9circular reference radiation used for cancer treatment is called ionizing radiation because it forms ions in the cells of the tissues it passes through as it dislodges electrons from atoms this can kill cells or change genes so the cells cannot grow other forms of radiation such as radio waves microwaves and light waves are called nonionizing they do not have as much energy so they are not able to ionize cells10 all modern communication systems use forms of electromagnetic radiation variations in the intensity of the radiation represent changes in the sound pictures or other information being transmitted for example a human voice can be sent as a radio wave or microwave by making the wave vary to corresponding variations in the voice musicians have also experimented with gamma rays sonification or using nuclear radiation to produce sound and music11 researchers use radioactive atoms to determine the age of materials that were once part of a living organism the age of such materials can be estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon they contain in a process called radiocarbon dating similarly using other radioactive elements the age of rocks and other geological features even some manmade objects can be determined this is called radiometric dating environmental scientists use radioactive atoms known as tracer atoms to identify the pathways taken by pollutants through the environment radiation is used to determine the composition of materials in a process called neutron activation analysis in this process scientists bombard a sample of a substance with particles called neutrons some of the atoms in the sample absorb neutrons and become radioactive the scientists can identify the elements in the sample by studying the emitted radiation radiation is not always dangerous and not all types of radiation are equally dangerous contrary to several common medical myths121314 for example although bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes particularly potassium40 40k which emit ionizing radiation when undergoing radioactive decay the levels of such radiation are far too low to induce radiation poisoning and bananas are not a radiation hazard it would not be physically possible to eat enough bananas to cause radiation poisoning as the radiation dose from bananas is noncumulative151617 radiation is ubiquitous on earth and humans are adapted to survive at the normal lowtomoderate levels of radiation found on earths surface the relationship between dose and toxicity is often nonlinear and many substances that are toxic at very high doses actually have neutral or positive health effects or are biologically essential at moderate or low doses there is some evidence to suggest that this is true for ionizing radiation normal levels of ionizing radiation may serve to stimulate and regulate the activity of dna repair mechanisms high enough levels of any kind of radiation will eventually become lethal however181920 ionizing radiation in certain conditions can damage living organisms causing cancer or genetic damage4 nonionizing radiation in certain conditions also can cause damage to living organisms such as burns in 2011 the international agency for research on cancer iarc of the world health organization who released a statement adding radio frequency electromagnetic fields including microwave and millimetre waves to their list of things which are possibly carcinogenic to humans21 rwth aachen universitys emfportal web site presents one of the biggest database about the effects of electromagnetic radiation as of 12 july 2019 it has 28547 publications and 6369 summaries of individual scientific studies on the effects of electromagnetic fields22 on earth there are different sources of radiation natural as well as artificial natural radiation can come from the sun earth itself or from cosmic radiation
