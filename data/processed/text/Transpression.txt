in geology transpression is a type of strikeslip deformation that deviates from simple shear because of a simultaneous component of shortening perpendicular to the fault plane this movement ends up resulting in oblique shear it is generally very unlikely that a deforming body will experience pure shortening or pure strikeslip the relative amounts of shortening and strikeslip can be expressed in the convergence angle alpha which ranges from zero ideal strikeslip to 90 degrees ideal convergence during shortening unless material is lost transpression produces vertical thickening in the crust transpression that occurs on a regional scale along plate boundaries is characterized by oblique convergence1 more locally transpression occurs within restraining bends in strikeslip fault zones transpressional shear zones are characterized by an association of structures that suggest zonenormal shortening and zoneparallel shearing commonly developed features include transposition foliations lineations stylolites folds and reverse faults pure sheardominated transpression usually gives steep lineations while simple sheardominated transpression favors horizontal lineations2 it is also common for nonvertical transpressional zones to have a significant component of shearing parallel to the diplinecheck spelling of the zone boundary in these zones the lineations are between horizontal and vertical the complete geometry presented by all structural elements in the zone is used to constrain the actual boundary displacements a fault bend or fault stepover forms when individual segments of the fault overlap and link together the type of structures which form along the strikeslip fault depend on the sense of slip relative to the sense of stepping when a sinistral fault steps to the right or a dextral fault steps to the left a restraining bend is formed2 geologists may also refer to a restraining bend as a left bend these are areas of positive relief topographic uplift crustal shortening and exhumation of crystalline basement as seen in deeply eroded outcrop exposures or from subsurface geophysical surveys restraining bends commonly define positive flower structures in plan view we see them form contractional strikeslip duplexes subparallel reverse or obliqueslip contractional faults that are bounded by two strikeslip segments restraining bends are widespread on the earths surface from suboutcropscale examples to large scale mountain ranges they have been theorized to occur on extraterrestrial bodies like jupiters icy moon europa and on venus3
