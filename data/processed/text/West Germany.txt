in europe dark grey in europe dark grey west germanya was the common english name for the federal republic of germany frgb from its formation on 23 may 1949 until its reunification with east germany on 3 october 1990 it is sometimes known as the bonn republicc after its capital city of bonn or as the second german republic5 during the cold war the western portion of germany and the associated territory of west berlin were parts of the western bloc west germany was formed as a political entity during the allied occupation of germany after world war ii established from twelve states formed in the three allied zones of occupation held by the united states the united kingdom and france at the onset of the cold war europe was divided between the western and eastern blocs germany was divided into the two countries initially west germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of germany representing itself as the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 18711945 german reich6 three southwestern states of west germany merged to form badenwrttemberg in 1952 and the saarland joined west germany as a state in 1957 after it had been separated as the saar protectorate from alliedoccupied germany by france the separation had been not legal as it had not been recognized by the allied control council in addition to the resulting ten states west berlin was considered an unofficial de facto eleventh state while de jure not part of west germany for berlin was under the control of the allied control council west berlin politically aligned itself with west germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions the foundation for the influential position held by germany today was laid during the economic miracle of the 1950s wirtschaftswunder when west germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by world war ii to become the worlds secondlargest economy the first chancellor konrad adenauer who remained in office until 1963 worked for a full alignment with the nato rather than neutrality and secured membership in the military alliance adenauer was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the presentday european union when the g6 was established in 1975 there was no serious debate as to whether west germany would become a member following the collapse of the eastern bloc symbolised by the opening of the berlin wall both states took action to achieve german reunification east germany voted to dissolve and accede to the federal republic of germany in 1990 the five postwar states lnder were reconstituted along with the reunited berlin which ended its special status and formed a sixth land they formally joined the federal republic on 3 october 1990 raising the total number of states from ten to 16 and ending the division of germany the reunited germany is thus the direct continuation of the state previously informally called west germany and not a new state as the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession the federal republic of germany was enlarged to include the additional six states of the dissolved german democratic republic the expanded federal republic retained west germanys political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations as well as its western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to western alliances such as the united nations nato oecd and the european economic community before reunification germany was divided between the bundesrepublik deutschland federal republic of germany commonly known as west germany and the deutsche demokratische republik ddr german democratic republic commonly known as east germany reunification was achieved by accession beitritt of the german democratic republic to the federal republic of germany so bundesrepublik deutschland became the official name of reunified germany in east germany the terms westdeutschland west germany or westdeutsche bundesrepublik west german federal republic were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s this changed under its constitutional amendment in 1974 when the idea of a single german nation was abandoned by east germany as a result it officially considered west germans and west berliners as foreigners the initialism brd frg in english began to prevail in east german usage in the early 1970s beginning in the newspaper neues deutschland other eastern bloc nations soon followed suit in 1965 the west german federal minister of allgerman affairs erich mende had issued the directives for the appellation of germany recommending avoiding the initialism brd on 31 may 1974 the heads of west german federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications from then on west german sources avoided the abbreviated form with the exception of leftleaning organizations which embraced it in november 1979 the federal government informed the bundestag that the west german public broadcasters ard and zdf had agreed to refuse to use the initialism7 the iso 31661 alpha2 country code of west germany was de for deutschland germany which has remained the country code of germany after reunification iso 31661 alpha2 codes are the most widely used country codes and the de code is notably used as a country identifier extending the postal code and as the internets country code toplevel domain de the less widely used iso 31661 alpha3 country code of west germany was deu which has remained the country code of reunified germany the now deleted codes for east germany on the other hand were dd in iso 31661 alpha2 and ddr in iso 31661 alpha3 the colloquial term west germany or its equivalent was used in many languages westdeutschland was also a widespread colloquial form used in germanspeaking countries usually without political overtones on 411 february 1945 leaders from the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union held the yalta conference where future arrangements regarding postwar europe and allied strategy against japan in the pacific were negotiated they agreed that the boundaries of germany as at 31 december 1937 would be chosen as demarcating german national territory from germanoccupied territory all german annexations after 1937 were automatically null subsequently and into the 1970s the west german state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be valid in international law although the allies had already agreed amongst themselves that the territories east of the oderneisse line must be transferred to poland and the soviet union in any peace agreement the conference agreed that postwar germany minus these transfers would be divided into four occupation zones a french zone in the far west a british zone in the northwest an american zone in the south and a soviet zone in the east berlin was separately divided into four zones these divisions were not intended to dismember germany only to designate zones of administration by the subsequent potsdam agreement the four allied powers asserted joint sovereignty over germany as a whole defined as the totality of the territory within the occupation zones former german areas east of the rivers oder and neisse and outside of germany as a whole were officially separated from german sovereignty in august 1945 and transferred from soviet military occupation to polish and soviet in the case of the territory of kaliningrad civil administration their polish and soviet status to be confirmed at a final peace treaty following wartime commitments by the allies to the governmentsinexile of czechoslovakia and poland the potsdam protocols also agreed to the orderly and humane transfer to germany as a whole of the ethnic german populations in poland czechoslovakia and hungary eight million german expellees and refugees eventually settled in west germany between 1946 and 1949 three of the occupation zones began to merge first the british and american zones were combined into the quasistate of bizonia soon afterwards the french zone was included into trizonia conversely the soviet zone became east germany at the same time new federal states lnder were formed in the allied zones replacing the geography of prenazi german states such as the free state of prussia and the republic of baden which had derived ultimately from former independent german kingdoms and principalities in the dominant postwar narrative of west germany the nazi regime was characterised as having been a criminal state8 illegal and illegitimate from the outset while the weimar republic was characterised as having been a failed state9 whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by hitler in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers consequently following the death of hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the german armed forces the national political judicial administrative and constitutional instruments of both nazi germany and the weimar republic were understood as entirely defunct such that a new west germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity10 nevertheless the new west germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the overall german state that was held to have embodied the unified german people since the frankfurt parliament of 1848 and which from 1871 had been represented within the german reich albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 may 1945 in 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the cold war for example the berlin airlift of 194849 the two german states that had originated in the western allied and the soviet zones respectively became known internationally as west germany and east germany commonly known in english as east germany the former soviet occupation zone in germany eventually became the german democratic republic or gdr in 1990 west germany and east germany jointly signed the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany also known as the twoplusfour agreement by which transitional status of germany following world war ii was definitively ended and the four allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for germany as a whole including the area of west berlin which had officially remained under allied occupation for the purposes of international and gdr law a status that the western countries applied to berlin as a whole despite the soviets declaring the end of occupation of east berlin unilaterally many decades before the twoplusfour agreement also saw the two parts of germany confirm their postwar external boundaries as final and irreversible including the 1945 transfer of former german lands east of the oderneisse line and the allied powers confirmed their consent to german reunification from 3 october 1990 after the reformation of the gdrs lnder the east german states and east berlin joined the federal republic with territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old middle ages east francia and the 19thcentury napoleonic confederation of the rhine the federal republic of germany was founded on 23 may 1949 under the terms of the bonnparis conventions whereby it obtained the full authority of a sovereign state on 5 may 1955 although full sovereignty was not obtained until the two plus four agreement in 1990d the former occupying western troops remained on the ground now as part of the north atlantic treaty organization nato which west germany joined on 9 may 1955 promising to rearm itself soon12 west germany became a focus of the cold war with its juxtaposition to east germany a member of the subsequently founded warsaw pact the former capital berlin had been divided into four sectors with the western allies joining their sectors to form west berlin while the soviets held east berlin west berlin was completely surrounded by east german territory and had suffered a soviet blockade in 194849 which was overcome by the berlin airlift the outbreak of the korean war in june 1950 led to us calls to rearm west germany to help defend western europe from the perceived soviet threat germanys partners in the european coal and steel community proposed to establish a european defence community edc with an integrated army navy and air force composed of the armed forces of its member states the west german military would be subject to complete edc control but the other edc member states belgium france italy luxembourg and the netherlands would cooperate in the edc while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces though the edc treaty was signed may 1952 it never entered into force frances gaullists rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty and when the french national assembly refused to ratify it august 1954 the treaty died the french gaullists and communists had killed the french governments proposal then other means had to be found to allow west german rearmament in response at the london and paris conferences the brussels treaty was modified to include west germany and to form the western european union weu west germany was to be permitted to rearm an idea many germans rejected and have full sovereign control of its military called the bundeswehr the weu however would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states also the german constitution prohibited any military action except in the case of an external attack against germany or its allies bndnisfall also germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience and serve for civil purposes instead13 the three western allies retained occupation powers in berlin and certain responsibilities for germany as a whole under the new arrangements the allies stationed troops within west germany for nato defense pursuant to stationing and statusofforces agreements with the exception of 55000 french troops allied forces were under natos joint defense command france withdrew from the collective military command structure of nato in 1966 konrad adenauer was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949 and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker however he ruled for 14 years the grand statesman of german postwar politics had to be draggedalmost literallyout of office in 196314 in october 1962 the weekly news magazine der spiegel published an analysis of the west german military defence the conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system ten days after publication the offices of der spiegel in hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized chancellor adenauer proclaimed in the bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted the editorowner of the magazine rudolf augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored the fdp members of adenauers cabinet resigned from the government demanding the resignation of franz josef strauss defence minister who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president and this episode damaged his reputation even further he announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963 his successor was to be ludwig erhard15 in the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly in 1962 growth rate was 47 and the following year 20 after a brief recovery the growth rate slowed again into a recession with no growth in 1967 a new coalition was formed to deal with this problem erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by kurt georg kiesinger he led a grand coalition between west germanys two largest parties the cducsu and the social democratic party spd this was important for the introduction of new emergency acts the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the twothirds majority of votes required for their ratification these controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency during the time leading up to the passing of the laws there was fierce opposition to them above all by the free democratic party the rising west german student movement a group calling itself notstand der demokratie democracy in crisis and members of the campaign against nuclear armament a key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967 when the shah of iran mohammad reza pahlavi visited west berlin several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the opera house where he was to attend a special performance supporters of the shah later known as jubelperser armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched a demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named benno ohnesorg was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman it has now been established that the policeman kurras was a paid spy of the east german security forces protest demonstrations continued and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made which was declared by the press especially the tabloid bildzeitung newspaper as a massive disruption to life in berlin in a massive campaign against the protesters protests against the us intervention in vietnam mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in berlin one of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from east germany called rudi dutschke who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in west berlin just before easter 1968 a young man tried to kill dutschke as he bicycled to the student union seriously injuring him all over west germany thousands demonstrated against the springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken16 in the wakes of these demonstrations in which the question of americas role in vietnam began to play a bigger role came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parentgeneration in the nazi era the proceedings of the war crimes tribunal at nuremberg had been widely publicised in germany but until a new generation of teachers educated with the findings of historical studies could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the german people one courageous attorney fritz bauer patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the auschwitz concentration camp and about twenty were put on trial in frankfurt in 1963 daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the german public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that the shoah was of vastly greater dimensions than the german population had believed the term holocaust for the systematic massmurder of jews first came into use in 1979 when a 1978 american miniseries with that name was shown on west german television the processes set in motion by the auschwitz trial reverberated decades later the calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate the issues of emancipation colonialism environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society in 1979 the environmental party the greens reached the 5 limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the free hanseatic city of bremen provincial election also of great significance was the steady growth of a feminist movement in which women demonstrated for equal rights until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account17 further reforms in 1979 to parental rights law gave equal legal rights to the mother and the father abolishing the legal authority of the father18 parallel to this a gay movement began to grow in the larger cities especially in west berlin where homosexuality had been widely accepted during the twenties in the weimar republic anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of benno ohnesorg and the attack on rudi dutschke coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters in may 1968 three young people set fire to two department stores in frankfurt they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the struggle against imperialism16 the student movement began to split into different factions ranging from the unattached liberals to the maoists and supporters of direct action in every formthe anarchists several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in italy of the red brigades brigate rosse many students went to work in the factories but with little or no success the most notorious of the underground groups was the red army faction which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen several bystanders and eventually two prominent west germans whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas in the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name raf the last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998 evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by german intelligence undercover agents has since emerged partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims the state counsel siegfried buback19 in october 1969 willy brandt became chancellor he maintained west germanys close alignment with the united states and focused on strengthening european integration in western europe while launching the new policy of ostpolitik aimed at improving relations with eastern europe brandt was controversial on both the right wing for his ostpolitik and on the left wing for his support of american policies including the vietnam war and rightwing authoritarian regimes the brandt report became a recognised measure for describing the general northsouth divide in world economics and politics between an affluent north and a poor south brandt was also known for his fierce anticommunist policies at the domestic level culminating in the radikalenerlass antiradical decree in 1972 in 1970 while visiting a memorial to the warsaw ghetto uprising crushed by the germans brandt unexpectedly knelt and meditated in silence a moment remembered as the kniefall von warschau brandt resigned as chancellor in 1974 after gnter guillaume one of his closest aides was exposed as an agent of the stasi the east german secret service finance minister helmut schmidt spd formed a coalition and he served as chancellor from 1974 to 1982 hansdietrich genscher a leading fdp official became vice chancellor and foreign minister schmidt a strong supporter of the european community ec and the atlantic alliance emphasized his commitment to the political unification of europe in partnership with the usa20 mounting external problems forced schmidt to concentrate on foreign policy and limited the domestic reforms that he could carry out the ussr upgraded its intermediaterange missiles which schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power because it increased the likelihood of political coercion and required a western response nato responded in the form of its twintrack policy the domestic reverberations were serious inside the spd and undermined its coalition with the fdp21 one of his major successes in collaboration with french president valry giscard destaing was the launching of the european monetary system ems in april 197822 in october 1982 the spdfdp coalition fell apart when the fdp joined forces with the cducsu to elect cdu chairman helmut kohl as chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence following national elections in march 1983 kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the cdu the cducsu fell just short of an absolute majority due to the entry into the bundestag of the greens who received 56 of the vote in january 1987 the kohlgenscher government was returned to office but the fdp and the greens gained at the expense of the larger parties kohls cdu and its bavarian sister party the csu slipped from 488 of the vote in 1983 to 443 the spd fell to 37 longtime spd chairman brandt subsequently resigned in april 1987 and was succeeded by hansjochen vogel the fdps share rose from 7 to 91 its best showing since 1980 the greens share rose to 83 from their 1983 share of 56 with the collapse of eastern bloc in 1989 symbolised by the opening of the berlin wall there was a rapid move towards german reunification and a final settlement of the postwar special status of germany following democratic elections east germany declared its accession to the federal republic subject to the terms of the unification treaty between the two states and then both west germany and east germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that treatys provisions east germany then dissolved itself and its five postwar states lnder were reconstituted along with the reunited berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional land they formally joined the federal republic on 3 october 1990 raising the number of states from 10 to 16 ending the division of germany the expanded federal republic retained west germanys political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations as well as its western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to western alliances like nato and the european union the official german reunification ceremony on 3 october 1990 was held at the reichstag building including chancellor helmut kohl president richard von weizscker former chancellor willy brandt and many others one day later the parliament of the united germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the reichstag building however at that time the role of berlin had not yet been decided upon only after a fierce debate considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of parliament the bundestag concluded on 20 june 1991 with quite a slim majority that both government and parliament should move to berlin from bonn political life in west germany was remarkably stable and orderly the adenauer era 194963 was followed by a brief period under ludwig erhard 196366 who in turn was replaced by kurt georg kiesinger 196669 all governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the christiandemocratic union cdu and christian social union csu either alone or in coalition with the smaller free democratic party fdp or other right leaning parties kiesingers 196669 grand coalition was between west germanys two largest parties the cducsu and the social democratic party spd this was important for the introduction of new emergency actsthe grand coalition gave the ruling parties the twothirds majority of votes required to see them in these controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a state of emergency leading up to the passing of the laws there was fierce opposition to them above all by the fdp the rising german student movement a group calling itself notstand der demokratie de democracy in a state of emergency and the labour unions demonstrations and protests grew in number and in 1967 the student benno ohnesorg was shot in the head by a policeman the press especially the tabloid bildzeitung newspaper launched a campaign against the protesters by 1968 a stronger desire to confront the nazi past had come into being in the 1970s environmentalism and antinationalism became fundamental values among leftwing germans as a result in 1979 the greens were able to reach the 5 minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the free hanseatic city of bremen state election and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the red army faction raf the raf was active from 1968 carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in west germany during the 1970s even in the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name raf the last action took place in 1993 and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities in the 1969 election the spd gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the fdp spd leader and chancellor willy brandt remained head of government until may 1974 when he resigned after the guillaume affair in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the east german intelligence service the stasi however the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for brandts resignation not a fundamental cause instead brandt dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression2324 as well as the economic fallout of the 1973 oil crisis almost seems simply to have had enough as brandt himself later said i was exhausted for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time25 finance minister helmut schmidt spd then formed a government continuing the spdfdp coalition he served as chancellor from 1974 to 1982 hansdietrich genscher a leading fdp official was vice chancellor and foreign minister in the same years schmidt a strong supporter of the european community ec and the atlantic alliance emphasized his commitment to the political unification of europe in partnership with the usa the goals of spd and fdp however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s on 1 october 1982 the fdp joined forces with the cducsu to elect cdu chairman helmut kohl as chancellor in a constructive vote of no confidence following national elections in march 1983 kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the cdu the cducsu fell just short of an absolute majority because of the entry into the bundestag of the greens who received 56 of the vote in january 1987 the kohlgenscher government was returned to office but the fdp and the greens gained at the expense of the larger parties the social democrats concluded that not only were the greens unlikely to form a coalition but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority neither condition changed until 1998 denazification was an allied initiative to rid german politics judiciary society culture press and economy of nazi ideology and personnel following the second world war it was carried out by removing those who had been nazi party or ss members from positions of power and influence by disbanding the organizations associated with nazism and by trying prominent nazis for war crimes26 the program was hugely unpopular in west germany and was opposed by the new government of konrad adenauer27 in 1951 several laws were passed granting amnesties and ending denazification as a result many people with a former nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of west germany28 between 1951 and 1953 there was even an effort by a clandestine group of former nazi functionaries known as the naumann circle to infiltrate the free democratic party fdp in order to lay the groundwork for an eventual return to power although this effort was exposed and disrupted many former nazis still attained positions of power and influence in the political system29 west german president 19741979 walter scheel and chancellor 19661969 kurt georg kiesinger were both former members of the nazi party konrad adenauers state secretary hans globke had played a major role in drafting the antisemitic nuremberg race laws in nazi germany30 in 1957 77 of the west german ministry of justices senior officials were former nazi party members31 in west germany most of the political agencies and buildings were located in bonn while the german stock market was located in frankfurt which became the economic center the judicial branch of both the german federal constitutional court bundesverfassungsgericht and the highest court of appeals were located in karlsruhe the west german government was known to be much more decentralised than its state socialist east german counterpart the former being a federal state and the latter a unitary one whilst east germany was divided into 15 administrative districts bezirke which were merely local branches of the national government west germany was divided into states lnder with independently elected state parliaments and control of the bundesrat the second legislative chamber of the federal government the official position of west germany concerning east germany at the outset was that the west german government was the only democratically elected and therefore the only legitimate representative of the german people according to the hallstein doctrine any country with the exception of the ussr that recognised the authorities of the german democratic republic would not have diplomatic relations with west germany in the early 1970s willy brandts policy of neue ostpolitik led to a form of mutual recognition between east and west germany the treaty of moscow august 1970 the treaty of warsaw december 1970 the four power agreement on berlin september 1971 the transit agreement may 1972 and the basic treaty december 1972 helped to normalise relations between east and west germany and led to both german states joining the united nations the hallstein doctrine was relinquished and west germany ceased to claim an exclusive mandate for germany as a whole following the ostpolitik the west german view was that east germany was a de facto government within a single german nation and a de jure state organisation of parts of germany outside the federal republic the federal republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the gdr de jure as a sovereign state under international law while at the same time acknowledging that within the structures of international law the gdr was an independent sovereign state by distinction west germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries not only the de facto and de jure government but also the sole de jure legitimate representative of a dormant germany as whole32 the two germanies relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations de jure in participating in international bodies and agreements such as the united nations and the helsinki final act this assessment of the basic treaty was confirmed in a decision of the federal constitutional court in 197333 the west german constitution grundgesetz basic law provided two articles for the unification with other parts of germany after the peaceful revolution of 1989 in east germany the volkskammer of the gdr on 23 august 1990 declared the accession of east germany to the federal republic under article 23 of the basic law and thus initiated the process of reunification to come into effect on 3 october 1990 nevertheless the act of reunification itself with its many specific terms and conditions including fundamental amendments to the west german basic law was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent unification treaty of 31 august 1990 that is through a binding agreement between the former gdr and the federal republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law35 this treaty was then voted into effect on 20 september 1990 by both the volkskammer and the bundestag by the constitutionally required twothirds majorities effecting on the one hand the extinction of the gdr and the reestablishment of lnder on the territory of east germany and on the other the agreed amendments to the basic law of the federal republic amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very article 23 in respect of which the gdr had nominally declared its postdated accession to the federal republic the two german states entered into a currency and customs union in july 1990 and on 3 october 1990 the german democratic republic dissolved and the reestablished five east german lnder as well as a unified berlin joined the federal republic of germany bringing an end to the eastwest divide the west german wirtschaftswunder economic miracle coined by the times began in 1950 this improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the reichsmark with the deutsche mark and halted rampant inflation the allied dismantling of the west german coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950 as demand for consumer goods increased after world war ii the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of german products at the time germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of germans from central and eastern europe which affected up to 165 million germans this helped germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war apart from these factors hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of gastarbeiter guest workers provided a vital base for the economic upturn this would have implications later on for successive german governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers36 with the dropping of allied reparations the freeing of german intellectual property and the impact of the marshall plan stimulus west germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world almost as strong as before the second world war the east german economy showed a certain growth but not as much as in west germany partly because of continued reparations to the ussr37 in 1952 west germany became part of the european coal and steel community which would later evolve into the european union on 5 may 1955 west germany was declared to have the authority of a sovereign stated the british french and us militaries remained in the country just as the soviet army remained in east germany four days after obtaining the authority of a sovereign state in 1955 west germany joined nato the uk and the usa retained an especially strong presence in west germany acting as a deterrent in case of a soviet invasion in 1976 west germany became one of the founding nations of the group of six g6 in 1973 west germanyhome to roughly 126 of the worlds populationfeatured the worlds fourthhighest gdp of 814796 million compared to east germanys 129969 million38 together combining for 944755 million and

bundesamt4 40 religious affiliation in west germany decreased from the 1960s onward42 religious affiliation declined faster among protestants than among catholics causing the roman catholic church to
