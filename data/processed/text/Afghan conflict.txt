ongoing lowlevel conflict12 the afghan conflict pashto dari 10 is the series of events that have kept afghanistan in a nearcontinuous state of armed conflict since the 1970s1112 early instability followed the collapse of the kingdom of afghanistan in the largely nonviolent 1973 coup dtat which deposed afghan monarch mohammad zahir shah in absentia ending his 40yearlong reign with the concurrent establishment of the republic of afghanistan headed by mohammad daoud khan the countrys relatively peaceful and stable period in modern history came to an end however allout fighting did not erupt until after 1978 when the saur revolution violently overthrew khans government and established the democratic republic of afghanistan subsequent unrest over the radical reforms that were being pushed by the thenruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan pdpa led to unprecedented violence prompting a largescale propdpa military intervention by the soviet union in 1979 in the ensuing sovietafghan war the antisoviet afghan mujahideen received extensive support from pakistan the united states and saudi arabia in a joint covert effort that was dubbed operation cyclone although the soviets withdrew from afghanistan in 1989 the various mujahideen factions continued to fight against the pdpa government which collapsed in the face of the peshawar accord in 1992 however the peshawar accord failed to remain intact in light of the mujahideens representatives inability to reach an agreement on a powersharing coalition for the new government triggering a multisided civil war between them by 1996 the taliban supported by pakistans interservices intelligence had seized the capital city of kabul in addition to approximately 90 of the country while northern afghanistan remained under the authority of the antitaliban northern alliance during this time the northern alliances islamic state of afghanistan enjoyed widespread international recognition and was represented at the united nations as opposed to the talibans islamic emirate of afghanistan which only received diplomatic recognition from three nations despite the fall of kabul to the taliban the northern alliance continued to resist in another civil war for the next five years after the september 11 attacks were carried out by alqaeda against the united states in 2001 the taliban granted saudiborn jihadist osama bin laden political asylum in the islamic emirates territory the groups subsequent noncompliance with the demand by the bush administration to extradite him prompted the americanled invasion of talibancontrolled afghanistan which bolstered the northern alliance by toppling the islamic emirate and installing the afghan transitional authority in 2002 the invasion triggered the 20yearlong war in afghanistan in which nato and natoallied countries fought alongside the nascent islamic republic of afghanistan to combat the taliban insurgency during the battle of tora bora the americanled military coalition failed to capture bin laden who subsequently relocated to pakistan and remained there until he was killed by us seal team six in abbottabad in 2011 nonetheless the fighting in afghanistan continued eventually leading to the 20202021 american withdrawal and ultimately ending with the 2021 taliban offensive which led to the reestablishment of the presentday islamic emirate though the countrywide war ended in 2021 clashes and unrest currently persist in some parts of afghanistan131415 due to the isistaliban conflict and the antitaliban republican insurgency as of 2025update the collapsed islamic republic of afghanistan remains the internationally recognized government of the country by 2014 adding different estimates of casualties for some of these individual conflicts together 1405111 to 2084468 people had been killed over the duration of the afghanistan conflict56789disputed discuss from 1933 to 1973 the kingdom of afghanistan experienced a lengthy period of peace and relative stability16 it was ruled as a monarchy by king zahir shah who belonged to the afghan musahiban barakzai dynasty1617 in the 1960s afghanistan as a constitutional monarchy held limited parliamentary elections18 shah was overthrown by his cousin mohammad daoud khan in july 1973 after discontent with the monarchy grew in the urban areas of afghanistan16 the country had experienced several droughts and charges of corruption and poor economic policies were leveled against the ruling dynasty khan abolished the monarchy and declared the republic of afghanistan and he became the first president of afghanistan he was supported by a faction of the peoples democratic party of afghanistan pdpa afghanistans communist party which was founded in 1965 and enjoyed a strong relationship with the soviet union in the rise of the taliban in afghanistan mass mobilization civil war and the future of the region neamatollah nojumi writes the establishment of the republic of afghanistan increased the soviet investment in afghanistan and the pdpa influence in the governments military and civil bodies19 in 1976 alarmed by the growing power of the pdpa and the partys strong affiliation with the soviet union khan tried to scale back the pdpas influence20 he dismissed pdpa members from their government posts appointed conservative elements instead and finally announced the dissolution of the pdpa arresting senior party members19 on 27 april 1978 the pdpa and military units loyal to the pdpa revolted and killed khan his immediate family and bodyguards in a violent coup during the battle to seize control of the capital kabul in the saur revolution21 as the pdpa had chosen a weekend holiday to conduct the coup when many government employees were having a day off khan was not able to fully activate the welltrained armed forces which remained loyal to him to counter the coup21 the pdpa formed a new government through a revolutionary council which attempted to balance the two major competing factions within itselfthe more radical and revolutionary khalq and the more moderate and reformist parcham the khalqist wing led by the charismatic nur muhammad taraki who became the new chairman gained supremacy in the aftermath of the revolution and adopted a program of land reform abolition of feudal and tribal structures and equality for women the council also prefixed the term democratic to the countrys daoudera name making it the democratic republic of afghanistan though these reforms were supported by the army and citydwelling population they opposed the very traditional religious and tribal customs of rural afghanistan which in turn led to strong rural and clerical opposition to the government and various antigovernment uprisings22 around this time the party came to be influenced by hafizullah amin who undermined taraki despite being a fellow khalqist purged parchamites from the party and began ruthlessly cracking down on political opposition therefore a hostile doctrine against any political dissent was adopted whether inside or outside the party19 taraki who had ruled for only about a year was assassinated by amin who took over formal leadership of the country23 amin was known for his independent and nationalist inclinations and was also seen by many as a ruthless leader he has been accused of killing tens of thousands of afghan civilians at pulecharkhi and other national prisons while cracking down on both the opposition and the parchamites 27000 politically motivated executions reportedly took place at pulecharkhi prison alone2425 afghans generally held amin personally responsible for most of the repression while the soviet union considered his government illegitimate discredited and doomed to collapse in a civil war2625 the soviet union secured an alliance with the more moderate babrak karmal and his parchamite faction invading afghanistan on 24 december 1979 and originally meeting only limited resistance27 amin was deposed from power almost immediately as he and 200 of his guards were killed during operation storm333 on 27 december by soviet army spetsnaz replaced by karmal after deployment into afghanistan soviet forces whom the locals dubbed shuravi along with government forces would begin to engage in a protracted counterinsurgency war against a wide coalition of various antigovernment insurgent forces who in turn styled themselves as mujahideenislamic holy warriors28 karmal declared a general amnesty for people imprisoned during taraki and amins rule and restored the afghan national symbols in place of the khalqist red flag he also granted several concessions to religious leaders and at least partially restored property seized during the original khalqist land reform28 however this did not satisfy the opposition as they considered his ascension to power during the soviet intervention to be a mark that he would rule as a soviet puppet thus continuing their insurgency against the government29 the soviet government realized that a military solution to the conflict would require far more troops because of this they discussed troop withdrawals and searched for a political and peaceful solution as early as 1980 but they never took any serious steps in that direction until 1988 early soviet military reports confirm the difficulties the soviet army had while fighting on the mountainous terrain for which the soviet army had no training parallels with the vietnam war were frequently referred to by soviet army officers30 policy failures and the stalemate that ensued after the soviet intervention led the soviet leadership to become highly critical of karmals leadership under mikhail gorbachev the soviet union was able to depose karmal and replace him with mohammad najibullah karmals leadership was seen as a failure by the soviet union because of the rise of violence and crime during his administration najibullah another parchamite attempted to end the insurgency through a policy of accommodation and power sharing known as the national reconciliation he reversed several of his predecessors unpopular reforms abolished the oneparty system reinstated islam as the state religion though still maintaining a fairly secular legal and political setup31 replaced the revolutionary council with a republican presidency and bicameral parliament removed communist symbols deemed provocative to the opposition from the countrys national emblem dropped the democratic prefix from the countrys name offered amnesty to mujahideen fighters and called for a sixmonth ceasefire in which fighting would stop in exchange for political negotiations intended to create a coalition government between the pdpa and various rebel groups in an attempt to end the countrys crisis the talks did not succeed in reconciling the government and the mujahideen though it was noted that they increased the governments popularity among urban areas stabilized the armed forces and led to a round of defections from disillusioned mujahideen fighters to government militias32 despite this the only insurgent group to fully reconcile with the government was the shiadominated afghan hizbullah a mujahideen boycott of the 1988 elections which were the firstever afghan elections to allow competing political parties foiled najibullahs attempt to reconstruct the nations parliament who in turn ordered 50 seats be left vacant to offer to the mujahideen if they decided to reconcile at a later date moreover though najibullah presented himself personally as a pious muslim and restored the legal status of islam his government was unable to acquire the same islamic credentials that the mujahideen forces wielded which in turn meant that many of his reforms were not nearly as successful at convincing the devout conservative rural and tribal population as najibullah had hoped33 most importantly najibullah oversaw the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan the withdrawal was to be done according to the geneva accords which entailed a full removal of soviet forces from afghanistan in exchange for the end of american and pakistan support to the mujahideen34 throughout the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan troop convoys came under attack by afghan rebel fighters in all 523 soviet soldiers were killed during the withdrawal the total withdrawal of all soviet troops from afghanistan was completed in february 198935 the last soviet soldier to leave was lieutenant general boris gromov leader of the soviet military operations in afghanistan at the time of the soviet invasion36 in total 14453 soviet soldiers died during the sovietafghan war though the soviet forces did withdraw the mujahideen refused to abide by the accords since they were not party to the negotiations furthermore the united states reneged on its agreement and continued funding the insurgent groups even after the soviet withdrawal37 najibullahs government further complained to the un that pakistan had also continued supplying training and arming the rebel forces fighting against his government34 the soviet war had a damaging impact on afghanistan the death of up to 2 million afghans in the war has been described as a genocide by a number of sources383940 five to ten million afghans fled to pakistan and iran amounting to 13 of the prewar population of the country and another 2 million were displaced within the country pakistans northwest frontier province functioned as an organisational and networking base for the antisoviet afghan resistance with the provinces influential deobandi ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the jihad41 after the soviet withdrawal the republic of afghanistan under najibullah continued to face resistance from the various mujahideen forces and instituted a state of emergency as he prepared to fend off the armed opposition on his own nevertheless najibullah received funding and arms from the soviet union until 1991 when the soviet union collapsed42 for several years the afghan army had actually increased their effectiveness past levels ever achieved during the soviet military presence the afghan army was able to prove itself in combat during the battle of jalalabad in 1989 where it defeated a major assault on the city by mujahideen forces with us and pakistani backing inflicting on them greater than 3000 losses moreover it was actually able to go on the offensive forestalling several more attacks and preventing the governmental collapse that both american and pakistani policymakers expected this greatly increased army morale and demoralized the rebel groups who had hoped for a quick postwithdrawal victory4344 in 1990 najibullah reformed the pdpa into the watan homeland party which rejected marxismleninism in favour of leftist afghan nationalism this did not necessarily have the desired effect as it did not lead to significant drop in opposition but did enrage several of his party members not only khalqists but also prokarmal parchamites who accused him of conceding too much of the saur revolutions gains to the mujahideen najibullah rejected the accusations stating that his actions had been done in an attempt to preserve and protect the gains of the revolution not sacrifice them regardless these reforms caused further rifts within the ruling party45 these tensions boiled over in the 1990 afghan coup dtat attempt in which a group of disillusioned khalqists led by defence minister shahnawaz tanai attempted to overthrow najibullah with the aid of hezbe islami gulbuddin and external support from pakistan the coup failed but led to many prokhalqist officers either fleeing the country or being sacked by najibullah considerably weakening the afghan armed forces46 the resulting instability led to a defeat in the siege of khost a year later to the hands of pakistanbacked mujahideen forces after ten years of heavy fighting47 another blow was dealt to his government in late 1991 as the dissolution of the soviet union signalled the end of foreign aid for najibullahs afghanistan as russian president boris yeltsin had neither the resources nor the desire to aid the afghan government48 because of this and with afghanistan being landlocked and not having a fuel supply of its own the relatively modern and formidable afghan air force essentially became grounded by a lack of fuel which in turn made it all the more difficult to supply the army and various progovernment militias spread across afghanistans harsh geography consequently causing a considerable increase in desertion49 a few months later and with the war still continuing najibullah offered his entire governments resignation and voiced his support for a united nations plan for a transitional administration including both watan and all mujahideen groups in the country this announcement led to the desertion of many of his own supporters who feared the end of his government50 in these circumstances abdul rashid dostum a leading army general created an alliance with the shurae nazar of ahmad shah massoud and turned against najibullah taking with him over 40000 previously progovernment soldiers najibullah sent a highranking army general to talk to dostum and attempt to salvage the situation only to learn that the general had also defected alongside his own foreign minister5152 these defections devastated the afghan armed forces morale and large parts of the afghan government and armed forces capitulated to the forces of massoud in early 1992 by april najibullah stated that he would be handing power to a sevenmember transitional council and resigning immediately mujahideen forces loyal to massoud and dostum entered and captured kabul shortly thereafter leading to the definitive end of pdpawatan rule in afghanistan53 najibullah was granted safety by the un office in kabul he had obtained political asylum in india but was unable to leave as he was prevented from doing so by forces loyal to massoud dostum and hekmatyar because of this he was forced to remain in the un building until he was captured dragged from a truck castrated and executed by the taliban several years later54 after the soviet defeat the wall street journal named massoud the afghan who won the cold war55 he had defeated the soviet forces nine times in his home region of the panjshir valley in northeastern afghanistan56 pakistan tried to install gulbuddin hekmatyar in power in afghanistan despite the opposition of all other mujahideen commanders and factions57 as early as october 1990 the interservices intelligence had devised a plan for hekmatyar to conduct a mass bombardment of the afghan capital kabul with possible pakistani troop enforcements57 this unilateral isihekmatyar plan came although the thirty most important mujahideen commanders had agreed on holding a conference inclusive of all afghan groups to decide on a common future strategy57 peter tomsen reports that the protest by the other mujahideen commanders was like a firestorm ahmad zia massoud the brother of ahmad shah massoud said that his faction strongly opposed the plan and like other factions would take measures if any pakistani troops reinforced hekmatyar abdul haq was reportedly so angry about the isi plan that he was red in the face57 and nabi mohammad another commander pointed out that kabuls 2 million could not escape hekmatyars rocket bombardmentthere would be a massacre57 representatives for massoud haq and wardak said that hekmatyars rocketing of kabul would produce a civilian bloodbath57 the united states finally put pressure on pakistan to stop the 1990 plan which was subsequently called off until 199257 after the fall of najibullahs government in 1992 the afghan political parties agreed on a powersharing agreement the peshawar accord the peshawar accord created the islamic state of afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period to be followed by general democratic elections human rights watch said the sovereignty of afghanistan was vested formally in the islamic state of afghanistan an entity created in april 1992 after the fall of the sovietbacked najibullah government with the exception of gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbe islami all of the parties were ostensibly unified under this government in april 1992 hekmatyars hezbe islami for its part refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and kabul generally shells and rockets fell everywhere58 hekmatyar received operational financial and military support from pakistan59 on modern afghanistan a history of struggle and survival afghanistan expert amin saikal says that pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in central asia islamabad could not possibly expect the new islamic government leaders to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help pakistan realize its regional ambitions had it not been for the isis logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets hekmatyars forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of kabul60 in addition saudi arabia and iranas competitors for regional hegemonysupported afghan militias hostile towards each other60 according to human rights watch iran was assisting the shia hazara hezbi wahdat forces of abdul ali mazari as iran was attempting to maximize wahdats military power and influence586061 saudi arabia supported the wahhabite abdul rasul sayyaf and his ittihadi islami faction5860 conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a fullscale war a publication by the george washington university describes the situation outside forces saw instability in afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas62 owing to the sudden initiation of the war working government departments police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created islamic state of afghanistan did not have time to form atrocities were committed by individuals of the different armed factions while kabul descended into lawlessness and chaos as described in reports by human rights watch and the afghanistan justice project5863 because of the chaos some leaders increasingly had only nominal control over their subcommanders64 for civilians there was little security from murder rape and extortion64 an estimated 25000 people died during the most intense period of bombardment by hekmatyars hezbi islami and the junbishi milli forces of dostum who had created an alliance with hekmatyar in 199463 half a million people fled afghanistan64 human rights watch writes rare ceasefires usually negotiated by representatives of ahmad shah massoud sibghatullah mojaddedi or burhanuddin rabbani the interim government or officials from the international committee of the red cross commonly collapsed within days58 southern afghanistan was not under the control of foreignbacked militias nor was it under the control of the government in kabul instead it was ruled by local leaders such as gul agha sherzai and their militias in 1994 the taliban a movement which originated in jamiat ulemaeislam religious schools for afghan refugees in pakistan also developed as a politicalreligious force in afghanistan reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor65 mullah omar founded his movement with less than 50 armed madrassah students in his home town of kandahar65 when the taliban took control of the city in 1994 they forced dozens of local pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities to surrender64 in 1994 the taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central afghanistan in late 1994 most of the militia factions hezbi islami junbishi milli and hezbi wahdat which had been fighting in the battle for control of kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the islamic states secretary of defense massoud bombardment of the capital came to a halt636667 massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections also inviting the taliban to join the process68 massoud had united political and cultural personalities governors commanders clergymen and representatives to reach a lasting agreement massoud like most people in afghanistan saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections his favourite for candidacy to the presidency was dr mohammad yusuf the first democratic prime minister under zahir shah the former king in the first meeting representatives from 15 different afghan provinces met in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating massoud went unarmed to talk to several taliban leaders in maidan shar but the taliban declined to join this political process68 when massoud returned safely the taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life he was killed by other senior taliban for failing to execute massoud while the possibility was there the taliban started to shell kabul in early 1995 but they were defeated by the forces of the islamic state government under massoud66 amnesty international referring to the taliban offensive wrote in a 1995 report this is the first time in several months that kabul civilians have become the targets of rocket attacks and shelling aimed at residential areas in the city66 the talibans early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses64 pakistan provided strong support to the taliban6069 many analysts like amin saikal describe the taliban as developing into a proxy force for pakistans regional interests which the taliban deny60 on 26 september 1996 as the taliban with military support from pakistan and financial support from saudi arabia prepared for another major offensive massoud ordered a full retreat from kabul70 the taliban seized kabul on 27 september 1996 and established the islamic emirate of afghanistan the taliban imposed on the parts of afghanistan under their control their interpretation of islam the physicians for human rights phr stated to phrs knowledge no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment71 women were required to wear the allcovering burqa they were banned from public life and denied access to health care and education windows needed to be covered so that women could not be seen from the outside and they were not allowed to laugh in a manner that could be heard by others71 the taliban without any real court or hearing cut peoples hands or arms off when they were accused of stealing71 taliban hitsquads watched the streets conducting arbitrary brutal public beatings71 the taliban began preparing offensives against the remaining areas controlled by massoud and dostum the former foes responded by allying to form the united front northern alliance against the taliban72 in addition to the dominantly tajik forces of massoud and the uzbek forces of dostum the united front included hazara factions and pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as abdul haq or haji abdul qadir prominent politicians of the united front were afghan prime minister abdul rahim ghafoorzai and the united fronts foreign minister abdullah abdullah from the taliban conquest in 1996 until november 2001 the united front controlled roughly 30 of afghanistans population in provinces such as badakhshan kapisa takhar and parts of parwan kunar nuristan laghman samangan kunduz ghr and bamyan according to a 55page report by the united nations the taliban while trying to consolidate control over northern and western afghanistan committed systematic massacres against civilians7374 un officials stated that there had been 15 massacres between 1996 and 20017374 they also said these have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the taliban ministry of defense or to mullah omar himself7374 in a major effort to retake the shomali plains the taliban indiscriminately killed civilians while uprooting and expelling the population kamal hossein a special reporter for the un reported on these and other war crimes upon taking mazarisharif in 1998 about 4000 civilians were executed by the taliban and many more reported tortured7576 the taliban especially targeted people of shia religious or hazara ethnic background7374 among those killed in mazariisharif were several iranian diplomats others were kidnapped by the taliban touching off a hostage crisis that nearly escalated to a fullscale war with 150000 iranian soldiers massed on the afghan border at one time77 it was later admitted that the diplomats were killed by the taliban and their bodies were returned to iran78 the documents also reveal the role of arab and pakistani support troops in these killings7374 osama bin ladens socalled 055 brigade was responsible for mass killings of afghan civilians79 the report by the united nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people7374 pakistans isi wanted the mujahideen to establish a government in afghanistan the directorgeneral of the isi hamid gul was interested in an islamic revolution which would transcend national borders not just in afghanistan and pakistan but also in central asia to set up the proposed mujahideen government gul ordered an assault on jalalabad with the intent on using it as the capital for the new government pakistan was interested in establishing in afghanistan80 the taliban were largely funded by isi in 19948182838485868788 the isi used the taliban to establish a regime in afghanistan which would be favorable to pakistan as they were trying to gain strategic depth89909192 since the creation of the taliban the isi and the pakistani military have given financial logistical and military support939495 according to pakistani afghanistan expert ahmed rashid between 1994 and 1999 an estimated 80000 to 100000 pakistanis trained and fought in afghanistan on the side of the taliban96 peter tomsen stated that pakistani military and isi officers along with thousands of regular pakistani armed forces personnel had been involved in the fighting in afghanistan97 in 2001 alone according to several international sources 2800030000 pakistani nationals 1400015000 afghan taliban and 20003000 al qaeda militants were fighting against antitaliban forces in afghanistan as a roughly 45000strong military force68799899 pakistani president pervez musharraf then as chief of army staff was responsible for sending thousands of pakistanis to fight alongside the taliban and bin laden against the forces of massoud6869100 of the estimated 28000 pakistani nationals fighting in afghanistan 8000 were militants recruited in madrassas filling regular taliban ranks79 a 1998 document by the us state department confirms that 2040 percent of regular taliban soldiers are pakistani69 the document further states that the parents of those pakistani nationals know nothing regarding their childs military involvement with the taliban until their bodies are brought back to pakistan69 according to the us state department report and reports by human rights watch the other pakistani nationals fighting in afghanistan were regular pakistani soldiers especially from the frontier corps but also from the pakistani army providing direct combat support69101 in 2000 human rights watch wrote of all the foreign powers involved in efforts to sustain and manipulate the ongoing fighting in afghanistan pakistan is distinguished both by the sweep of its objectives and the scale of its efforts which include soliciting funding for the taliban bankrolling taliban operations providing diplomatic support as the talibans virtual emissaries abroad arranging training for taliban fighters recruiting skilled and unskilled manpower to serve in taliban armies planning and directing offensives providing and facilitating shipments of ammunition and fuel and directly providing combat support101 on 1 august 1997 the taliban launched an attack on sheberghan the main military base of dostum dostum has said the reason the attack was successful was that 1500 pakistani commandos took part and that the pakistani air force also gave support102 in 1998 iran accused pakistani troops of war crimes at bamiyan and claimed that pakistani warplanes had in support of the taliban bombarded afghanistans last shia stronghold103104 the same year russia said pakistan was responsible for the military expansion of the taliban in northern afghanistan by sending large numbers of pakistani troops some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the antitaliban united front105 in 2000 the un security council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the taliban with un officials explicitly singling out pakistan the un secretarygeneral implicitly criticized pakistan for its military support and the security council expressed deep distress over reports of involvement in the fighting on the taliban side of thousands of nonafghan nationals some of whom were below the age of 14106 in july 2001 several countries including the united states accused pakistan of being in violation of un sanctions because of its military aid to the taliban107 the taliban also obtained financial resources from pakistan in 1997 alone after the capture of kabul by the taliban pakistan gave 30 million in aid and a further 10 million for government wages108 in 2000 british intelligence reported that the isi was taking an active role in several al qaeda training camps109 the isi helped with the construction of training camps for both the taliban and al qaeda109110111 from 1996 to 2001 the al qaeda of osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri became a state within the taliban state112 bin laden sent arab and central asian alqaeda militants to join the fight against the united front among them his 055 brigade112113 dostum and his forces were defeated by the taliban in 1998 dostum subsequently went into exile massoud became the only leader to remain in afghanistan and who was able to defend vast parts of his area against the taliban in the areas under his control massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the womens rights declaration114 in the area of massoud women and girls did not have to wear the afghan burqa they were allowed to work and to go to school in at least two known instances massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage68 to massoud there was reportedly nothing worse than treating a person like an object68 he stated it is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the almighty both have equal rights women can pursue an education women can pursue a career and women can play a role in society just like men68 in massoud from warrior to statesman author pepe escobar writes massoud is adamant that in afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations he says that the cultural environment of the country suffocates women but the taliban exacerbate this with oppression his most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space freedom and equality to women they would have the same rights as men68 while it was massouds stated conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights he also had to deal with afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome in his opinion that could only be achieved through education68 humayun tandar who took part as an afghan diplomat in the 2001 international conference on afghanistan in bonn said that strictures of language ethnicity region were also stifling for massoud that is why he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day68 this applied also to strictures of religion jeanjos puig describes how massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a christian friend jeanjos puig or the jewish princeton university professor michael barry jeanjos we believe in the same god please tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language68 human rights watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of massoud for the period from october 1996 until the assassination of massoud in september 2001115 one million people fled the taliban many to the area of massoud116117 in its inside the taliban documentary national geographic states the only thing standing in the way of future taliban massacres is ahmad shah massoud100 the taliban repeatedly offered massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance but massoud declined he explained in one interview the taliban say come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us and they would keep the highest office in the country the presidentship but for what price the difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state we can not accept their conditions of compromise or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy we are fundamentally against the system called the emirate of afghanistan118 in another interview he was quoted as saying there should be an afghanistan where every afghan finds himself or herself happy and i think that can only be assured by democracy based on consensus119 with his proposals for peace120 massoud wanted to convince the taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections in a foreseeable future118 massoud stated the taliban are not a force to be considered invincible they are distanced from the people now they are weaker than in the past there is only the assistance given by pakistan osama bin laden and other extremist groups that keep the taliban on their feet with a halt to that assistance it is extremely difficult to survive119 in early 2001 massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals121 resentment was increasingly gathering against taliban rule from the bottom of afghan society including the pashtun areas121 massoud publicized their cause of popular consensus general elections and democracy worldwide at the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed kabul government of the early 1990s121 in 1999 he began training police forces specifically to keep order and protect the civilian population in case the united front was successful68 massoud also addressed the european parliament in brussels asking the international community to provide humanitarian help to the people of afghanistan122 he stated that the taliban and al qaeda had introduced a very wrong perception of islam and that without the support of pakistan and bin laden the taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year123 on this visit to europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a largescale attack on us soil being imminent124failed verification125 the president of the european parliament nicole fontaine called him the pole of liberty in afghanistan126 on 9 september 2001 massoud was the target of a suicide attack by two arabs posing as journalists at khwaja bahauddin in the takhar province127128 massoud died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital the funeral though in a rather rural area was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people129 the assassination was not the first time alqaeda the taliban the pakistani isiand before them the soviet kgb the afghan communist khad and hekmatyarhad tried to assassinate massoud he survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years the first attempt on massouds life was carried out by hekmatyar and two pakistani isi agents in 1975 when massoud was only 22 years old61 in early 2001 alqaeda wouldbe assassins were captured by massouds forces while trying to enter his territory121 the assassination of massoud is believed to have a strong connection to the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states which killed nearly 3000 people and appeared to be the terrorist attack that massoud had warned the european parliament about when he made his speech in the presence of it several months earlier130 john p oneill was a counterterrorism expert and the assistant director of the fbi until late 2001 he retired from the fbi and was offered the position of director of security at the world trade center wtc he took the job at the wtc two weeks before 911 on 10 september 2001 oneill allegedly told two of his friends were due and were due for something big some things have happened in afghanistan referring to the assassination of massoud i dont like the way things are lining up in afghanistani sense a shift and i think things are going to happensoon131 oneill died when the south tower collapsed131 after the terrorist attacks of 11 september 2001 massouds united front troops with american air support ousted the taliban from power in kabul in operation enduring freedom in november and december 2001 the united front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the posttaliban interim government of hamid karzai in late 2001132 the usled war in afghanistan began on 7 october 2001 as operation enduring freedom it was designed to capture or kill osama bin laden and alqaeda militants as well as replace the taliban with a usfriendly government the bush doctrine stated that as policy it would not distinguish between alqaeda and nations that harbor them several afghan leaders were invited to germany in december 2001 for the un sponsored bonn agreement which was to restore stability and governance in their country in the first step the afghan transitional administration was formed and was installed on 22 december133 chaired by hamid karzai it numbered 30 leaders and included a supreme court an interim administration and a special independent commission a loya jirga grand assembly was convened in june 2002 by former king zahir shah who returned from exile after 29 years karzai was elected president for the two years in the jirga in which the afghan interim authority was also replaced with the transitional islamic state of afghanistan tisa a constitutional loya jirga was held in december 2003 adopting the 2004 constitution with a presidential form of government and a bicameral legislature134 karzai was elected in the 2004 presidential election followed by winning a second term in the 2009 presidential election both the 2005 and the 2010 parliamentary elections were also successful in the meantime the reconstruction process of afghanistan began in 2002 there were more than 14000 reconstruction projects such as the kajaki dam and the salma dam135 many of these projects were supervised by the provincial reconstruction teams the world bank afghanistan reconstruction trust fund was set up in 2002 which was financed by 24 international donor countries and spent more than 137 billion as of 2007136 approximately 30 billion dollars were provided by the international community for the reconstruction of afghanistan most of it from the united states in 2002 the world community allocated 4 billion at the tokyo conference followed by another 4 billion in 2004 in february 2006 105 billion were committed for afghanistan at the london conference137 and 11 billion from the united states in early 2007 despite these vast investments by the international community the reconstruction efforts results were mixed implementation of development projects was frequently marred by lack of coordination knowledge of local conditions and sound planning on the side of international donors as well as by corruption and inefficiency on the side of afghan government officials on the provincial and national level projects such as the national solidarity programme interprovincial road construction and the usled revamping of rural health services met with more success nato and afghan troops led many offensives against the taliban in this period by 2009 a talibanled shadow government began to form complete with their own version of mediation court138 in 2010 us president barack obama deployed an additional 30000 soldiers over a period of six months and proposed that he would begin troop withdrawals by 2012 at the 2010 international conference on afghanistan in london karzai said he intended to reach out to the taliban leadership including mullah omar sirajuddin haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar supported by senior us officials karzai called on the groups leadership to take part in a loya jirga meeting to initiate peace talks according to the wall street journal these steps were initially reciprocated with an intensification of bombings assassinations and ambushes139 many afghan groups including the former intelligence chief amrullah saleh and opposition leader dr abdullah abdullah believed that karzais plan aimed to appease the insurgents senior leadership at the cost of the democratic constitution the democratic process and progress in the field of human rights especially womens rights140 abdullah stated i should say that taliban are not fighting in order to be accommodated they are fighting in order to bring the state down so its a futile exercise and its just misleading there are groups that will fight to the death whether we like to talk to them or we dont like to talk to them they will continue to fight so for them i dont think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily in terms of the taliban on the ground there are lots of possibilities and opportunities that with the help of the people in different parts of the country we can attract them to the peace process provided we create a favorable environment on this side of the line at the moment the people are leaving support for the government because of corruption so that expectation is also not realistic at this stage141 according to a report by the united nations the taliban were responsible for 76 of civilian casualties in 2009142 afghanistan was struggling to rebuild itself while dealing with the results of 30 years of war corruption among highlevel politicians and the ongoing taliban insurgency which according to different scientific institutes such as the london school of economics senior international officials such as former united states chairman of the joint chief of staff admrial michael mullen believed the taliban was backed by the isi143144 at the end of july 2010 the netherlands became the first nato ally to end its combat mission in afghanistan after 4 years military deployment including the most intense period of hostilities they withdrew 1900 troops the atlantic council described the decision as politically significant because it comes at a time of rising casualties and growing doubts about the war145 canada withdrew troops in 2011 but about 900 were left to train afghani soldiers146147 in february 2012 a small number of american service members burned several copies of the quran some afghans responded by staging massive demonstrations and riots in kabul and other areas assailants killed several american military personnel including two officers in the interior ministry building following this event on 11 march 2012 an american soldier robert bales killed 16 civilians in the kandahar massacre according to isaf there were about 120000 natoled troops in afghanistan per december 2012 of which 66000 were us troops and 9000 british the rest were from 48 countries a process of handing over power to local forces had started and according to plans a majority of international troops would leave in 2014148 on 24 november 2013 karzai held a loya jirga and imposed a ban on nato house raids this ban was put in place and nato soldiers were instructed to adhere to it in december 2013 a house raid in zabul province was exceptionally carried out by two nato soldiers karzai condemned this in a highly publicised speech on 3 january 2014 a bomb blast was heard by nato soldiers in a base in kabul there were no reported casualties or injuries the day after a bomb hit a us military base in kabul and killed one us citizen the bomb was planted by the taliban and the american service member was the first combat casualty in afghanistan in that year the taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on 1 may 2015 the media reported a scheduled meeting in qatar between taliban insurgents and peacemakers including the karzai about ending the war149150151 in 2016 the government signed a peace deal with hekmatyars hezbe islami which was at the time the second largest antigovernment insurgent after the taliban152 the deal proved controversial and several sectors of afghan society protested against it because of the hekmatyars alleged war crimes153 tensions between the us and pakistan worsened as us president donald trump accused pakistan of harboring the taliban154 afghan president ashraf ghani offered unconditional peace talks to the taliban offering them legal status as a regular political party alongside the release of taliban prisoners over 20 nations and organizations backed the deal but it was rejected by the taliban who refused to negotiate with the afghan government the taliban insisted on only negotiating directly with the united states and only upon a full us withdrawal from the countrya demand the us rejected155 an unprecedented threeday ceasefire was negotiated in 2018 around the eid alfitr celebrations with taliban members openly approaching and talking to civilians and government forces the ceasefire was widely celebrated and ghani announced it would be extended by ten days with some societal leaders calling for it to be made permanent the taliban however rejected the extension and relaunched their military campaign against the government at the end of the original threeday period156 as the afghan government had fallen into a major dispute over the 2019 afghan presidential election in which both ghani and his rival abdullah abdullah claimed victory a powersharing deal between the two men was signed which assigned responsibility for the peace negotiations to the latter157 eventually and after several years of backandforth negotiations the us trump administration struck a major deal with the taliban in 2020 known as the doha agreement the deal provided for a full but staggered us withdrawal from afghanistan in exchange for a taliban pledge not to allow alqueda to reestablish itself in the country and commit itself to talks with the afghan government which was not a party to the agreement158 the deal also required the afghan president to release 5000 taliban prisoners in exchange for a taliban release of 1000 captive afghan soldiers ghani having never agreed to the deal rejected the prisoner release stating that it was not a us prerogative and adding that he would reject any other releases as a prerequisite to talibanafghan government talks159 the taliban replied by reiterating that they would not start any talks with the afghan government until the 5000 prisoners were released160 the situation led to an increase in taliban attacks with the group having launched more than 4500 attacks on government forces during the 45day period following the signing of the doha agreementa 70 increase compared to the same period during the previous year161 as the us had stopped conducting airstrikes on taliban targets as part of the agreement in exchange for a halting of taliban attacks on us forces taliban casualties dropped by about two thirds during this period161 following what was described as some of the bloodiest fighting in 19 years the us conducted several airstrikes against the group in early march 2020162 ghani agreed on releasing 1500 taliban prisoners so long as those prisoners signed a pledge not to return to combat once released163 the taliban rejected this move insisting on the full and unconditional release of the full 5000 prisoner list164 by august the government agreed to free the 5000 taliban captives but stated that it could not release 400 of them as they had been accused of serious crimes against civilians calling a loya jirga to decide their fate it ruled in favor of release and all of the prisoners were freed165166 following these developments the first intraafghan talks between the taliban and afghan government were held in qatar167 in april 2021 the newly inaugurated us president joe biden announced that all us troops would withdraw from the country by 11 september 2021 the 20year anniversary of the 911 attacks168 he later brought this date forward to 31 august169 as us forces started to withdraw in may the taliban stepped up attacks on the afghan government170 the group began by first capturing the countryside to surround regional capitals then taking those capitals without facing any major resistance the united states intelligence community warned in july that the afghan government was likely to collapse 612 months after the us withdrawal171 biden stated that he would not cease or delay the withdrawal regardless of the situation172 by 15 august almost the entire country was under the control of the taliban who had already encircled and were preparing to enter the nations capital ghani fled the country to tajikistan and kabul was captured that same day with the entire political and military apparatus of the islamic republic having collapsed173169 the remainder of the nato forces in the country occupied the hamid karzai international airport in kabul evacuating hundreds of thousands of servicemen and civilians in their last act while in afghanistan coalition forces destroyed or damaged most of what was left behind in the airport to prevent it from being used by the taliban totalling 75 aircraft and over 100 vehicles and other equipment alongside the airports antiair defences before definitively leaving the country on 30 august thus meeting bidens withdrawal deadline174 biden defended his decision stating that he did not wish to prolong the forever war and blamed the afghan authorities for not having found a political settlement and fleeing the country for the collapse of the countrys government adding that the collapse had nevertheless unfolded more quickly than anticipated according to biden the american mission in the country had never been nationbuilding but instead a preemption of attacks on the us homeland which he considered to have been a success175 following the coalitions withdrawal taliban forces captured the airport and announced they would form a new government shortly thereafter176 despite the call to have some refugees admitted to the us after the withdrawal of nato troops only a tiny percentage of vulnerable afghans seeking to move to the united states under a refugee resettlement program were admitted to the us refugees admitted through the p2 criteria by the state departments preexisting priority 1 program had the only option to be referred to the un high commissioner for refugees or a designated ngo177 as the taliban took over kabul a coordination council was formed to transfer power to the taliban consisting of former mujahideen and hezbe islami commander gulbuddin hekmatyar former president hamid karzai and political leader abdullah abdullah178 the latter two then met with taliban representatives with the stated goal of ensuring safety and returning normalcy to the capital179 however it was reported that the two would likely not be a part of the future taliban government180 the new york times reported that karzai had been forced out of his home after the taliban disarmed his guards and took over security at his residence instead moving in to live in abdullahs house181 according to a source cited by the cnn both had effectively been placed under house arrest with their security details removed and at the mercy of the taliban182 following the talibans victory across afghanistan the islamic republics vice president and longtime opponent of the taliban amrullah saleh cited provisions in the 2004 constitution of afghanistan which would make him acting president of the country in doing so he appealed to a sense of continuity of the islamic republic which would lend him political legitimacy as kabul alongside the vast majority of afghanistan was under taliban control he joined forces with ahmad massoud son of former mujahideen commander ahmad shah massoud in declaring the national resistance front of afghanistan also known as the panjshir resistance an antitaliban coalition based in the panjshir valley in turn he was recognized as president by massoud as well as defence minister bismillah khan mohammadi183 a smallscale uprising led by the group in august 2021 succeeded in ousting the taliban from three districts establishing its own control in the valley184 the front often compared to the northern alliance reached a ceasefire with the taliban shortly thereafter185 the ceasefire did not last long and by the start of september the taliban had launched an assault against the panjshir resistance186 by 3 september the taliban claimed to have defeated the resistance establishing taliban control over the entirety of afghanistan for the first time in the countrys history these claims were dismissed as lies by resistance forces which in turn claimed they were still in control of much of their positions and were actively fighting the taliban187 fighting continued into the following day and mark milley chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff warned that the situation could develop into a fullscale civil war188 at the same time notable regional leaders tajik atta muhammad nur and uzbek abdul rashid dostum the pdpaera commander who turned on najibullah in 1991 and formed his own uzbekdominated and relatively leftsecular political movement junbish fled the country to avoid what they dubbed conspiracy as mazarisharif fell to the taliban the two had been bitter political rivals but joined forces in the face of the taliban advance according to nur the local equipment of the armed forces had been handed over to the taliban in a cowardly plot intended to entrap him and dostum which led to the fall of the city189 the two joined with other regional strongmen and politicians in creating a front for negotiations with the taliban in which they would hope to achieve concessions from the predominantly pashtun group for their respective local movements and ethnicities the two stated that they would never accept a surrender and were preparing for armed antitaliban resistance should the talks fail190191 prior to the ultimate fall of the panjshir valley to the taliban the following day both saleh and massoud fled the panjshiri capital but remained in the province192193 at least 14 armed antitaliban resistance groups including the national resistance front afghanistan freedom front supreme resistance council freedom uprising194 are active in afghanistan afghaniranian clashes occurred in december 2021 overlapping with the republican insurgency in afghanistan between the restored islamic emirate of afghanistan and iran in nimruz over border checkpoints it resulted in a de facto taliban victory with the islamic emirate capturing various border checkpoints however the taliban later withdrew from the checkpoints and things returned to status quo ante bellum195196
