in mathematics an equation is a mathematical formula that expresses the equality of two expressions by connecting them with the equals sign 23 the word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings for example in french an quation is defined as containing one or more variables while in english any wellformed formula consisting of two expressions related with an equals sign is an equation4 solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true the variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation there are two kinds of equations identities and conditional equations an identity is true for all values of the variables a conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables56 the symbol which appears in every equation was invented in 1557 by robert recorde who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length1 an equation is written as two expressions connected by an equals sign 2 the expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the lefthand side and righthand side of the equation very often the righthand side of an equation is assumed to be zero this does not reduce the generality as this can be realized by subtracting the righthand side from both sides the most common type of equation is a polynomial equation commonly called also an algebraic equation in which the two sides are polynomials the sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms for example the equation has lefthand side a x 2 b x c y displaystyle ax2bxcy which has four terms and righthand side 0 displaystyle 0 consisting of just one term the names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns and that a b and c are parameters but this is normally fixed by the context in some contexts y may be a parameter or a b and c may be ordinary variables an equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed when equal weights of something eg grain are placed into the two pans the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal if a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance an equal amount must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance more generally an equation remains balanced if the same operation is performed on each side7 two equations or two systems of equations are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions the following operations transform an equation or a system of equations into an equivalent one provided that the operations are meaningful for the expressions they are applied to if some function is applied to both sides of an equation the resulting equation has the solutions of the initial equation among its solutions but may have further solutions called extraneous solutions for example the equation x 1 displaystyle x1 has the solution x 1 displaystyle x1 raising both sides to the exponent of 2 which means applying the function f s s 2 displaystyle fss2 to both sides of the equation changes the equation to x 2 1 displaystyle x21 which not only has the previous solution but also introduces the extraneous solution x 1 displaystyle x1 moreover if the function is not defined at some values such as 1x which is not defined for x 0 solutions existing at those values may be lost thus caution must be exercised when applying such a transformation to an equation the above transformations are the basis of most elementary methods for equation solving as well as some less elementary ones like gaussian elimination an equation is analogous to a weighing scale balance or seesaw each side of the equation corresponds to one side of the balance to the left and to the right different quantities can be placed on each side if the weights on the two sides are equal the scale balances and in analogy the equality that represents the balance is also balanced if not then the lack of balance corresponds to an inequality represented by an inequation in the illustration x y and z are all different quantities in this case real numbers represented as circular weights and each of x y and z has a different weight addition corresponds to adding weight while subtraction corresponds to removing weight from what is already there when equality holds the total weight on each side is the same equations often contain terms other than the unknowns these other terms which are assumed to be known are usually called constants coefficients or parameters an example of an equation involving x and y as unknowns and the parameter r is when r is chosen to have the value of 2 r 2 this equation would be recognized in cartesian coordinates as the equation for the circle of radius of 2 around the origin hence the equation with r unspecified is the general equation for the circle usually the unknowns are denoted by letters at the end of the alphabet x y z w while coefficients parameters are denoted by letters at the beginning a b c d for example the general quadratic equation is usually written ax2 bx c 0 the process of finding the solutions or in case of parameters expressing the unknowns in terms of the parameters is called solving the equation such expressions of the solutions in terms of the parameters are also called solutions a system of equations is a set of simultaneous equations usually in several unknowns for which the common solutions are sought thus a solution to the system is a set of values for each of the unknowns which together form a solution to each equation in the system for example the system has the unique solution x 1 y 1 an identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variables it contains many identities are known in algebra and calculus in the process of solving an equation an identity is often used to simplify an equation making it more easily solvable in algebra an example of an identity is the difference of two squares which is true for all x and y trigonometry is an area where many identities exist these are useful in manipulating or solving trigonometric equations two of many that involve the sine and cosine functions are and which are both true for all values of for example to solve for the value of that satisfies the equation where is limited to between 0 and 45 degrees one may use the above identity for the product to give yielding the following solution for since the sine function is a periodic function there are infinitely many solutions if there are no restrictions on in this example restricting to be between 0 and 45 degrees would restrict the solution to only one number algebra studies two main families of equations polynomial equations and among them the special case of linear equations when there is only one variable polynomial equations have the form px 0 where p is a polynomial and linear equations have the form ax b 0 where a and b are parameters to solve equations from either family one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis algebra also studies diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers the techniques used are different and come from number theory these equations are difficult in general one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution and if they exist to count the number of solutions in general an algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation of the form where p and q are polynomials with coefficients in some field eg rational numbers real numbers complex numbers an algebraic equation is univariate if it involves only one variable on the other hand a polynomial equation may involve several variables in which case it is called multivariate multiple variables x y z etc for example is a univariate algebraic polynomial equation with integer coefficients and is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rational numbers some polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression with a finite number of operations involving just those coefficients ie can be solved algebraically this can be done for all such equations of degree one two three or four but equations of degree five or more cannot always be solved in this way as the abelruffini theorem demonstrates a large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation see root finding of polynomials and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations see system of polynomial equations a system of linear equations or linear system is a collection of linear equations involving one or more variablesb for example is a system of three equations in the three variables x y z a solution to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied a solution to the system above is given by since it makes all three equations valid the word system indicates that the equations are to be considered collectively rather than individually in mathematics the theory of linear systems is a fundamental part of linear algebra a subject which is used in many parts of modern mathematics computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra and play a prominent role in physics engineering chemistry computer science and economics a system of nonlinear equations can often be approximated by a linear system see linearization a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system in euclidean geometry it is possible to associate a set of coordinates to each point in space for example by an orthogonal grid this method allows one to characterize geometric figures by equations a plane in threedimensional space can be expressed as the solution set of an equation of the form a x b y c z d 0 displaystyle axbyczd0 where a b c displaystyle abc and d displaystyle d are real numbers and x y z displaystyle xyz are the unknowns that correspond to the coordinates of a point in the system given by the orthogonal grid the values a b c displaystyle abc are the coordinates of a vector perpendicular to the plane defined by the equation a line is expressed as the intersection of two planes that is as the solution set of a single linear equation with values in r 2 displaystyle mathbb r 2 or as the solution set of two linear equations with values in r 3 displaystyle mathbb r 3 a conic section is the intersection of a cone with equation x 2 y 2 z 2 displaystyle x2y2z2 and a plane in other words in space all conics are defined as the solution set of an equation of a plane and of the equation of a cone just given this formalism allows one to determine the positions and the properties of the focuses of a conic the use of equations allows one to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions the cartesian coordinate system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem once the figures are transformed into equations thus the name analytic geometry this point of view outlined by descartes enriches and modifies the type of geometry conceived of by the ancient greek mathematicians currently analytic geometry designates an active branch of mathematics although it still uses equations to characterize figures it also uses other sophisticated techniques such as functional analysis and linear algebra in cartesian geometry equations are used to describe geometric figures as the equations that are considered such as implicit equations or parametric equations have infinitely many solutions the objective is now different instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them which is impossible one uses equations for studying properties of figures this is the starting idea of algebraic geometry an important area of mathematics one can use the same principle to specify the position of any point in threedimensional space by the use of three cartesian coordinates which are the signed distances to three mutually perpendicular planes or equivalently by its perpendicular projection onto three mutually perpendicular lines the invention of cartesian coordinates in the 17th century by ren descartes revolutionized mathematics by providing the first systematic link between euclidean geometry and algebra using the cartesian coordinate system geometric shapes such as curves can be described by cartesian equations algebraic equations involving the coordinates of the points lying on the shape for example a circle of radius 2 in a plane centered on a particular point called the origin may be described as the set of all points whose coordinates x and y satisfy the equation x2 y2 4 a parametric equation for a curve expresses the coordinates of the points of the curve as functions of a variable called a parameter89 for example are parametric equations for the unit circle where t is the parameter together these equations are called a parametric representation of the curve the notion of parametric equation has been generalized to surfaces manifolds and algebraic varieties of higher dimension with the number of parameters being equal to the dimension of the manifold or variety and the number of equations being equal to the dimension of the space in which the manifold or variety is considered for curves the dimension is one and one parameter is used for surfaces dimension two and two parameters etc a diophantine equation is a polynomial equation in two or more unknowns for which only the solutions such that all the unknowns take integer values are sought a linear diophantine equation is an equation between two sums of monomials of degree zero or one an example of linear diophantine equation is ax by c where a b and c are constants an exponential diophantine equation is one for which exponents of the terms of the equation can be unknowns diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations in more technical language they define an algebraic curve algebraic surface or more general object and ask about the integer lattice points on it the word diophantine refers to the hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century diophantus of alexandria who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra the mathematical study of diophantine problems that diophantus initiated is now called diophantine analysis an algebraic number is a number that is a solution of a nonzero polynomial equation in one variable with rational coefficients or equivalently by clearing denominators with integer coefficients numbers such as that are not algebraic are said to be transcendental almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics classically studying solutions of polynomial equations modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra especially commutative algebra with the language and the problems of geometry the fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are plane algebraic curves which include lines circles parabolas ellipses hyperbolas cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates and cassini ovals a point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points the inflection points and the points at infinity more advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations a differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives in applications the functions usually represent physical quantities the derivatives represent their rates of change and the equation defines a relationship between the two they are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable and are used in areas such as physics chemistry biology and economics in pure mathematics differential equations are studied from several different perspectives mostly concerned with their solutions the set of functions that satisfy the equation only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas however some properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without finding their exact form if a selfcontained formula for the solution is not available the solution may be numerically approximated using computers the theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy an ordinary differential equation or ode is an equation containing a function of one independent variable and its derivatives the term ordinary is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation which may be with respect to more than one independent variable linear differential equations which have solutions that can be added and multiplied by coefficients are welldefined and understood and exact closedform solutions are obtained by contrast odes that lack additive solutions are nonlinear and solving them is far more intricate as one can rarely represent them by elementary functions in closed form instead exact and analytic solutions of odes are in series or integral form graphical and numerical methods applied by hand or by computer may approximate solutions of odes and perhaps yield useful information often sufficing in the absence of exact analytic solutions a partial differential equation pde is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives this is in contrast to ordinary differential equations which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives pdes are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables and are either solved by hand or used to create a relevant computer model pdes can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound heat electrostatics electrodynamics fluid flow elasticity or quantum mechanics these seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of pdes just as ordinary differential equations often model onedimensional dynamical systems partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems pdes find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations equations can be classified according to the types of operations and quantities involved important types include
