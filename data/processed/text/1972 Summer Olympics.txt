bavarian minga 1972 were an international multisport event held in munich west germany from 26 august to 11 september 1972 it was the second summer olympics to be held in germany after the 1936 games in berlin which had taken place under the nazi rule germany became only the second country at that point after the united states to have two different cities host the summer olympics2 the west german government had been eager to have the munich olympics present a democratic and optimistic germany to the world as shown by the games official motto die heiteren spiele3 or the cheerful games4 the logo of the games was a blue solar logo the bright sun by otl aicher the designer and director of the visual conception commission5 the hostesses wore skyblue dirndls as a promotion of bavarian cultural heritage6 the olympic mascot the dachshund waldi was the first officially named olympic mascot the olympic fanfare was composed by herbert rehbein7 the soviet union won the most gold and overall

hall the olympics hall olympiahalle a multipurpose facility and the olympic stadium olympiastadion and an olympic village very close to the park the design of these stadia was considered revolutionary with sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by metal ropes used on such a large scale for the first time8 the event was overshadowed by the munich massacre in the second week in which 11 israeli athletes and coaches and a west german police officer at the olympic village were killed by the palestinian militant organisation black september munich won its olympic bid on 26 april 1966 at the 64th ioc session in rome italy over bids presented by detroit madrid and montral montral would eventually host the following olympic games in 197610 other bids including one from the two cities that expressed interest alongside paris submitted a letter to the ioc to make an official bid but it ultimately did not materialize11 the games were largely overshadowed by what has come to be known as the munich massacre just before dawn on 5 september a group of eight members of the palestinian black september militant organization broke into the olympic village and took eleven israeli athletes coaches and officials hostage in their apartments two of the hostages who resisted were killed in the first moments of the breakin the subsequent standoff in the olympic village lasted for almost 18 hours late in the evening of 5 september that same day the terrorists and their nine remaining hostages were transferred by helicopter to the military airport of frstenfeldbruck ostensibly to board a plane bound for an undetermined arab country the german authorities planned to ambush them there but underestimated the numbers of their opposition and were thus undermanned during a botched rescue attempt all of the israeli hostages were killed four of them were shot then incinerated when one of the terrorists detonated a grenade inside the helicopter in which the hostages were sitting the 5 remaining hostages were then shot and killed with a machine gun our worst fears have been realized tonight they have now said that there were 11 hostages two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning nine were killed at the airport tonight theyre all gone all but three of the terrorists were killed as well although arrested and imprisoned pending trial they were released by the west german government on 29 october 1972 in exchange for the hijacked lufthansa flight 615 two of those three were supposedly hunted down and assassinated later by the mossad13 jamal algashey who is believed to be the sole survivor is still living today in hiding in an unspecified african country with his wife and two children the olympic events were suspended several hours after the initial attack for the first time in the modern olympic games history but once the incident was concluded avery brundage the international olympic committee president declared that the games must go on a memorial ceremony was then held in the olympic stadium and the competitions resumed after a stoppage of 34 hours due to the suspension the games that were originally to close on 10 september were rescheduled to 11 september14 the attack prompted heightened security at subsequent olympics beginning with the 1976 winter olympicscitation needed the massacre led the german federal government to reexamine its antiterrorism policies which at the time were dominated by a pacifist approach imposed after world war ii this led to the creation of the elite counterterrorist unit gsg 9 similar to the british sas it also led israel to launch the mossad assassinations following the munich massacre in which those suspected of involvement were systematically tracked down and assassinatedcitation needed the events of the munich massacre were chronicled in the oscarwinning documentary one day in september15 an account of the aftermath is also dramatized in three films the 1976 madefortv movie 21 hours at munich
