josephlouis lagrangea born giuseppe luigi lagrangia5b or giuseppe ludovico de la grange tournier6c 25 january 1736 10 april 1813 also reported as giuseppe luigi lagrange7 or lagrangia8 was an italian and naturalized french mathematician physicist and astronomer he made significant contributions to the fields of analysis number theory and both classical and celestial mechanics in 1766 on the recommendation of leonhard euler and dalembert lagrange succeeded euler as the director of mathematics at the prussian academy of sciences in berlin prussia where he stayed for over twenty years producing many volumes of work and winning several prizes of the french academy of sciences lagranges treatise on analytical mechanics mcanique analytique 4 ed 2 vols paris gauthiervillars et fils 178889 which was written in berlin and first published in 1788 offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since isaac newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century in 1787 at age 51 he moved from berlin to paris and became a member of the french academy of sciences he remained in france until the end of his life he was instrumental in the decimalisation process in revolutionary france became the first professor of analysis at the cole polytechnique upon its opening in 1794 was a founding member of the bureau des longitudes and became senator in 1799 lagrange was one of the creators of the calculus of variations deriving the eulerlagrange equations for extrema of functionals he extended the method to include possible constraints arriving at the method of lagrange multipliers lagrange invented the method of solving differential equations known as variation of parameters applied differential calculus to the theory of probabilities and worked on solutions for algebraic equations he proved that every natural number is a sum of four squares his treatise theorie des fonctions analytiques laid some of the foundations of group theory anticipating galois in calculus lagrange developed a novel approach to interpolation and taylors theorem he studied the threebody problem for the earth sun and moon 1764 and the movement of jupiters satellites 1766 and in 1772 found the specialcase solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as lagrangian points lagrange is best known for transforming newtonian mechanics into a branch of analysis lagrangian mechanics he presented the mechanical principles as simple results of the variational calculus in appearance he was of medium height and slightly formed with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion in character he was nervous and timid he detested controversy and to avoid it willingly allowed others to take the credit for what he had himself done he always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction ww rouse ball9 firstborn of eleven children as giuseppe lodovico lagrangia lagrange was of italian and french descent7 his paternal greatgrandfather was a french captain of cavalry whose family originated from the french region of tours7 after serving under louis xiv he had entered the service of charles emmanuel ii duke of savoy and married a conti from the noble roman family7 lagranges father giuseppe francesco lodovico was a doctor in law at the university of torino while his mother was the only child of a rich doctor of cambiano in the countryside of turin710 he was raised as a roman catholic but later on became an agnostic11 his father who had charge of the kings military chest and was treasurer of the office of public works and fortifications in turin should have maintained a good social position and wealth but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations a career as a lawyer was planned out for lagrange by his father7 and certainly lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly he studied at the university of turin and his favourite subject was classical latin at first he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics finding greek geometry rather dull it was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by edmond halley from 169312 which he came across by accident alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies at the end of a years incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician charles emmanuel iii appointed lagrange to serve as the sostituto del maestro di matematica mathematics assistant professor at the royal military academy of the theory and practice of artillery in 1755 where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the piedmontese armys early adoption of the ballistics theories of benjamin robins and leonhard euler in that capacity lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school according to alessandro papacino dantoni the academys military commander and famous artillery theorist lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style abstract reasoning and impatience with artillery and fortificationengineering applications13 in this academy one of his students was franois daviet14 lagrange is one of the founders of the calculus of variations starting in 1754 he worked on the problem of the tautochrone discovering a method of maximizing and minimizing functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions lagrange wrote several letters to leonhard euler between 1754 and 1756 describing his results he outlined his algorithm leading to the eulerlagrange equations of variational calculus and considerably simplifying eulers earlier analysis15 lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics generalising the results of euler and maupertuis euler was very impressed with lagranges results it has been stated that with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written which covered some of the same ground in order that the young italian might have time to complete his work and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus however this chivalric view has been disputed16 lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the turin society in 1762 and 1773 in 1757 together with giuseppe angelo saluzzo a chemist who made his home available for the meetings and the physicist giovanni francesco cigna lagrange established a society which was subsequently incorporated as the turin academy of sciences7 most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of the academys transactions usually known as the miscellanea taurinensia many of these are elaborate papers the first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound in this he indicates a mistake made by newton obtains the general differential equation for the motion and integrates it for motion in a straight line this volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a string vibrating transversely in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by brook taylor dalembert and euler and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time t is given by the equation y a sin m x sin n t displaystyle yasinmxsinnt the article concludes with a masterly discussion of echoes beats and compound sounds other articles in this volume are on recurring series probabilities and the calculus of variations the second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations and he illustrates its use by deducing the principle of least action and by solutions of various problems in dynamics the third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations some papers on the integral calculus a solution of a fermats problem given an integer n which is not a perfect square to find a number x such that nx2 1verification needed is a perfect square and the general differential equations of motion for three bodies moving under their mutual attractions the next work he produced was in 1764 on the libration of the moon and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth a problem which he treated by the aid of virtual work his solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion equations which he first formally proved in 1780 already by 1756 euler and maupertuis seeing lagranges mathematical talent tried to persuade lagrange to come to berlin but he shyly refused the offer in 1765 dalembert interceded on lagranges behalf with frederick of prussia and by letter asked him to leave turin for a considerably more prestigious position in berlin he again turned down the offer responding that17 361 in 1766 after euler left berlin for saint petersburg frederick himself wrote to lagrange expressing the wish of the greatest king in europe to have the greatest mathematician in europe resident at his court lagrange was finally persuaded he spent the next twenty years in prussia where he produced a long series of papers published in the berlin and turin transactions and composed his monumental work the mcanique analytique in 1767 he married his cousin vittoria conti lagrange was a favourite of the king who frequently lectured him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life the lesson was accepted and lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines and experimented to find the exact amount of work which he could do before exhaustion every night he set himself a definite task for the next day and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or the subjectmatter were capable of improvement he carefully planned his papers before writing them usually without a single erasure or correction nonetheless during his years in berlin lagranges health was rather poor and that of his wife vittoria was even worse she died in 1783 after years of illness and lagrange was very depressed in 1786 frederick ii died and the climate of berlin became difficult for lagrange10 in 1786 following fredericks death lagrange received similar invitations from states including spain and naples and he accepted the offer of louis xvi to move to paris in france he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the louvre were prepared for his reception and he became a member of the french academy of sciences which later became part of the institut de france 1795 at the beginning of his residence in paris he was seized with an attack of melancholy and even the printed copy of his mcanique on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk curiosity as to the results of the french revolution first stirred him out of his lethargy a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed it was about the same time 1792 that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24yearold renefranoiseadlade le monnier daughter of his friend the astronomer pierre charles le monnier she insisted on marrying him and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached in september 1793 the reign of terror began under the intervention of antoine lavoisier who himself was by then already thrown out of the academy along with many other scholars lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of october 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave france on 4 may 1794 lavoisier and 27 other tax farmers were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial lagrange said on the death of lavoisier though lagrange had been preparing to escape from france while there was yet time he was never in any danger different revolutionary governments and at a later time napoleon gave him honours and distinctions this luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before i believe that in general one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living even when they are unreasonable10 a striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the french commissary in italy was ordered to attend in the full state on lagranges father and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son who had done honour to all mankind by his genius and whom it was the special glory of piedmont to have produced it may be added that napoleon when he attained power warmly encouraged scientific studies in france and was a liberal benefactor of them appointed senator in 1799 he was the first signer of the snatusconsulte which in 1802 annexed his fatherland piedmont to france7 he acquired french citizenship in consequence7 the french claimed he was a french mathematician but the italians continued to claim him as italian10 lagrange was involved in the development of the metric system of measurement in the 1790s he was offered the presidency of the commission for the reform of weights and measures la commission des poids et mesures when he was preparing to escape after lavoisiers death in 1794 it was largely lagrange who influenced the choice of the metre and kilogram units with decimal subdivision by the commission of 179918 lagrange was also one of the founding members of the bureau des longitudes in 1795 in 1795 lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established cole normale which enjoyed only a short existence of four months his lectures there were elementary they contain nothing of any mathematical importance though they do provide a brief historical insight into his reason for proposing undecimal or base 11 as the base number for the reformed system of weights and measures19 23 the lectures were published because the professors had to pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory les professeurs aux coles normales ont pris avec les reprsentants du peuple et entreux lengagement de ne point lire ou dbiter de mmoire des discours crits20 iii the discourses were ordered and taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves it was also thought the published lectures would interest a significant portion of the citizenry quoique des feuilles stnographiques soient essentiellement destines aux lves de lcole normale on doit prvoir quelles seront lues par une grande partie de la nation20 v in 1794 lagrange was appointed professor of the cole polytechnique and his lectures there described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them were almost perfect both in form and mattercitation needed beginning with the merest elements he led his hearers on until almost unknown to themselves they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation however lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher fourier who attended his lectures in 1795 wrote in 1810 lagrange started a thorough revision of the mcanique analytique but he was able to complete only about twothirds of it before his death in paris in 1813 in 128 rue du faubourg sainthonor napoleon honoured him with the grand croix of the ordre imprial de la runion just two days before he died he was buried that same year in the panthon in paris the inscription on his tomb reads in translation joseph louis lagrange senator count of the empire grand officer of the legion of honour grand cross of the imperial order of the reunion member of the institute and the bureau of longitude born in turin on 25 january 1736 died in paris on 10 april 1813 lagrange was extremely active scientifically during the twenty years he spent in berlin not only did he produce his mcanique analytique but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the academy of turin the berlin academy and the french academy some of these are really treatises and all without exception are of a high order of excellence except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month of these note the following as amongst the most important first his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes 17661773 of the miscellanea taurinensia of which the most important was the one in 1771 in which he discussed how numerous astronomical observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result and later his contributions to the first two volumes 17841785 of the transactions of the turin academy to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion and to the second an article on integration by infinite series and the kind of problems for which it is suitable most of the papers sent to paris were on astronomical questions and among these including his paper on the jovian system in 1766 his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772 his work on the secular equation of the moon in 1773 and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778 these were all written on subjects proposed by the acadmie franaise and in each case the prize was awarded to him between 1772 and 1788 lagrange reformulated classicalnewtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations these mechanics are called lagrangian mechanics the greater number of his papers during this time were however contributed to the prussian academy of sciences several of them deal with questions in algebra several of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory there are also numerous articles on various points of analytical geometry in two of them written rather later in 1792 and 1793 he reduced the equations of the quadrics or conicoids to their canonical forms during the years from 1772 to 1785 he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of partial differential equations a large part of these results was collected in the second edition of eulers integral calculus which was published in 1794 lastly there are numerous papers on problems in astronomy of these the most important are the following over and above these various papers he composed his fundamental treatise the mcanique analytique in this book he lays down the law of virtual work and from that one fundamental principle by the aid of the calculus of variations deduces the whole of mechanics both of solids and fluids the object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained the method of generalised coordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system as dalembert and euler had done he showed that if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables x called generalized coordinates whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation for example in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation which is now usually written in the form where t represents the kinetic energy and v represents the potential energy of the system he then presented what we now know as the method of lagrange multipliersthough this is not the first time that method was publishedas a means to solve this equation23 amongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum and the principle of least action all the analysis is so elegant that sir william rowan hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions namely the time and the three coordinates of the point in space and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram at first no printer could be found who would publish the book but legendre at last persuaded a paris firm to undertake it and it was issued under the supervision of laplace cousin legendre editor and condorcet in 178810 lagranges lectures on the differential calculus at cole polytechnique form the basis of his treatise thorie des fonctions analytiques which was published in 1797 this work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the berlin papers in 1772 and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series relying in particular on the principle of the generality of algebra a somewhat similar method had been previously used by john landen in the residual analysis published in london in 1758 lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus the book is divided into three parts of these the first treats of the general theory of functions and gives an algebraic proof of taylors theorem the validity of which is however open to question the second deals with applications to geometry and the third with applications to mechanics another treatise on the same lines was his leons sur le calcul des fonctions issued in 1804 with the second edition in 1806 it is in this book that lagrange formulated his celebrated method of lagrange multipliers in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints these works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of cauchy jacobi and weierstrass at a later period lagrange fully embraced the use of infinitesimals in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms and in the preface to the second edition of the mcanique analytique which was issued in 1811 he justifies the employment of infinitesimals and concludes by saying that his rsolution des quations numriques published in 1798 was also the fruit of his lectures at cole polytechnique there he gives the method of approximating the real roots of an equation by means of continued fractions and enunciates several other theorems in a note at the end he shows how fermats little theorem that is where p is a prime and a is prime to p may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation he also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots a theory of the planetary motions had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of lagranges berlin papers in 1806 the subject was reopened by poisson who in a paper read before the french academy showed that lagranges formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits lagrange who was present now discussed the whole subject afresh and in a letter communicated to the academy in 1808 explained how by the variation of arbitrary constants the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined euler proposed lagrange for election to the berlin academy and he was elected on 2 september 1756 he was elected a fellow of the royal society of edinburgh in 1790 a fellow of the royal society and a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in 1806 in 1808 napoleon made lagrange a grand officer of the legion of honour and a count of the empire he was awarded the grand croix of the ordre imprial de la runion in 1813 a week before his death in paris and was buried in the panthon a mausoleum dedicated to the most honoured french people lagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the french academy of sciences for his memoir on the libration of the moon in 1766 the academy proposed a problem of the motion of the satellites of jupiter and the prize again was awarded to lagrange he also shared or won the prizes of 1772 1774 and 1778 lagrange is one of the 72 prominent french scientists who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the eiffel tower when it first opened rue lagrange in the 5th arrondissement in paris is named after him in turin the street where the house of his birth still stands is named via lagrange the lunar crater lagrange and the asteroid 1006 lagrangea also bear his name the initial version
