also downplayed by former stasi spy chief markus wolf and putins former kgb colleague vladimir usoltsev journalist catherine belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for putins

and is preparing for many more years of war7071 four russian sources told reuters that putin was ready to end the war in ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire that would recognize russias war gains and freeze the war on the then front lines as putin wanted to avoid unpopular steps such as further mobilization and increased war spending72 in august 2024 putin pardoned american journalist evan gershkovich opposition figures vladimir karamurza ilya yashin and others in a prisoner swap with western countries737475 the 2024 ankara prisoner exchange was the most extensive between russia and

participants in such an aggression7980 russia and the united states are the worlds biggest nuclear powers holding 88 of the worlds nuclear weapons81 putin has made implicit nuclear threats since the

organizing the 89 federal subjects of russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts whose official title is plenipotentiary representative93 according to stephen white under the presidency of putin russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a second edition of the american or british political system but rather a system that was closer to russias own traditions and circumstances94 some commentators have described putins administration as a sovereign democracy959697 according to the proponents of that description primarily vladislav surkov the governments actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country98 the practice of the system is characterized by swedish economist anders slund as manual management commenting after putin resumed the presidency in 2012 his rule is best described as manual management as the russians like to put it putin does whatever he wants with little consideration to the consequences with one important caveat during the russian financial crash of august 1998 putin learned that financial crises are politically destabilizing and must be avoided at all costs therefore he cares about financial stability99 the period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of elections censorship and toughening of free assembly laws in july 2000 according to a law proposed by putin and approved by the federal assembly of russia putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects in 2004 the direct election of those heads usually called governors by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures100101 this was seen by putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime102 this and other government actions effected under putins presidency have been criticized by many independent russian media outlets and western commentators as antidemocratic103104 during his first term in office putin opposed some of the yeltsinera business oligarchs as well as his political opponents resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as boris berezovsky vladimir gusinsky and mikhail khodorkovsky other oligarchs such as roman abramovich and arkady rotenberg are friends and allies with putin105 putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and

economic policy divided it into four distinct periods the reform years of his first term 19992003 the statist years of his second term 2004the first half of 2008 the world economic crisis and recovery the second half of 20082013 and the russoukrainian war russias growing isolation from the global economy and stagnation 2014present109 in 2000 putin launched the programme for the socioeconomic development of the russian federation for the period 20002010 but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30 complete110 fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including recordhigh oil prices910 under the putin administration from 2000 to 2016 an increase in income in usd terms was 45 times111 during putins first eight years in office industry grew substantially as did production construction real

continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to china of 400bn120 the ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against russia these events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight although it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on russias economy121122123 in 2014 the organized crime and corruption reporting project named putin their person of the year for furthering corruption and organized crime124125 according to meduza putin has

2004 putin signed the kyoto protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions128 however russia did not face mandatory cuts because the kyoto protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and russias greenhousegas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the soviet union129 excluding emissions from land use landuse change and forestry lulucf130 in 2019 russia joined the paris agreement131 russias goal is to reach net zero by 2060 but its energy strategy to 2035 is mostly about

church on the main holy days and has established a good relationship with patriarchs of the russian church the late alexy ii of moscow and the current kirill of moscow as president putin took an active personal part in promoting the act of canonical communion with the moscow patriarchate signed 17 may 2007 which restored relations between the moscowbased russian orthodox church and the russian orthodox church outside russia after the 80year schism137 under putin the hasidic federation of jewish communities of russia became increasingly influential within the jewish community partly due to the influence of federationsupporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with putin notably lev leviev and roman abramovich138139 according to the jewish telegraphic agency putin is popular amongst the russian jewish community who see him as a force for stability russias chief rabbi berel lazar said putin paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a

reducing the size of the central command introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff elimination of cadrestrength formations reorganising the reserves reorganising the army into a brigade system and reorganising air forces into an airbase system instead of regiments147 according to the kremlin putin embarked on a buildup of russias nuclear capabilities because of us president george w bushs unilateral decision to withdraw from the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty148 to counter what putin sees as the united states goal of undermining russias strategic nuclear deterrent moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons capable of defeating any new american ballistic missile defense or interception system some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under putin has brought russia into violation of the 1987 intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty149 accordingly us president donald trump announced the us would no longer consider itself bound by the treatys provisions raising nuclear tensions between the two powers149 this prompted putin to state that russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but that an aggressor should know that vengeance is inevitable that he will be annihilated and we would be the victims of the aggression we will go to heaven as martyrs150 putin has also sought to increase russian territorial claims in the arctic and its military presence there in august 2007 russian expedition arktika 2007 part of research related to the 2001 russian territorial extension claim planted a flag on the seabed at the north pole151

return to the kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently166 the internet has attracted putins attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information167 marian k leighton who worked for the cia as a soviet analyst in the 1980s says having muzzled russias print and broadcast media putin focused his energies on the internet168 robert w orttung and christopher walker reported that reporters without borders for instance ranked russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in terms of freedom of

journalists freedom house ranks russian media as not free indicating that basic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are absent169 about twothirds of russians use television as their primary source of daily news170 while around 85 of russians get most of their information from russian state media171 in the early 2000s putin and his circle began promoting the idea in russian media that they are the modernday version of the 17thcentury romanov tsars who ended russias time of troubles meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the

church endorsed his election in 2012 stating putins terms were like a miracle of god177 steven myers reports the church once heavily repressed had emerged from the soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions now kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state178 mark woods a baptist union of great britain minister and contributing editor to christian today provides specific examples of how the church has backed the expansion of russian power into crimea and eastern ukraine179 some russian orthodox believers consider putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents still others appreciate that putin defends some although not all orthodox teachings whether or not he

which appeared on the governments website russia at the turn of the millenium192 she presents putin as orienting himself to the plan that russia is a country with unique values in danger of losing its unity which is a historic russian fear this again points to the fundamental issue of russias identity issues and how the state had manipulated these to drive antiwestern security narratives with the aim of eroding the usled global order moreover a look at russias distribution of forces over the years under putin has been heavily weighted towards the south syria ukraine middle east another indicator of the kremlins threat perceptions193194 leonid bershidsky analyzed putins interview with the financial times and concluded putin is an imperialist of the old soviet school rather than a

2000 shortly after a visit to south korea217 putin criticized violence in myanmar against rohingya minorities in 2017218 following the 2021 myanmar coup dtat russia has pledged to boost ties with the myanmar military regime219 under putin the kremlin has consistently stated that russia has a sphere of influence and privileged interests over other postsoviet states which are referred to as the near abroad in russia it has also been stated that the postsoviet states are strategically vital to russian interests220 some russia experts have compared this concept to the monroe doctrine221 a series of socalled colour revolutions in the postsoviet states namely the rose revolution in georgia in 2003 the orange revolution in ukraine in 2004 and the tulip revolution in kyrgyzstan in 2005 led to frictions in the relations of those countries with russia in december 2004 putin criticized the rose and orange revolutions saying if you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the postsoviet space into endless conflict222 putin allegedly declared at a natorussia summit in 2008 that if ukraine joined nato russia could contend to annex the ukrainian east and crimea223 at the summit he told us president george w bush that ukraine is not even a state while the following year putin referred to ukraine as little russia224 following the revolution of dignity in march 2014 the russian federation annexed crimea225226227 according to putin this was done because crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of russia228 after the russian annexation of crimea he said that ukraine includes regions of russias historic south and was created on a whim by the bolsheviks229 he went on to declare that the february 2014 ousting of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych had been orchestrated by the west as an attempt to weaken russia our western partners have crossed a line they behaved rudely irresponsibly and unprofessionally he said adding that the people who had come to power in ukraine were nationalists neonazis russophobes and antisemites229 in a july 2014 speech during a russiansupported armed insurgency in eastern ukraine putin stated he would use russias entire arsenal of available means up to operations under international humanitarian law and the right of selfdefence to protect russian speakers outside russia230231 with the attainment of autocephaly by the ukrainian orthodox church in december 2018 and subsequent schism of the russian orthodox church from constantinople a number of experts came to the conclusion that putins policy of forceful engagement in postsoviet republics significantly backfired on him leading to a situation where he annexed crimea but lost ukraine and provoked a much more cautious approach to russia among other postsoviet countries232233 in late august 2014 putin stated people who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me but it seems to me that the russian and ukrainian peoples are practically one people234 after making a similar statement in late december 2015 he stated the ukrainian culture as well as ukrainian literature surely has a source of its own235 in july 2021 he published a lengthy article on the historical unity of russians and ukrainians236 revisiting these themes and saying the formation of a ukrainian state hostile to moscow was comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us237238it was made mandatory reading for militarypolitical training in the russian armed forces239 in august 2008 georgian president mikheil saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway south ossetia however the georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 south ossetia war after regular russian forces entered south ossetia and then other parts of georgia then also opened a second front in the other georgian breakaway province of abkhazia with abkhazian forces240 despite existing or past tensions between russia and most of the postsoviet states putin has followed the policy of eurasian integration putin endorsed the idea of a eurasian union in 2011241242 the concept was proposed by the

union was established on 1 january 2015245 under putin russias relations have improved significantly with uzbekistan the second largest postsoviet republic after ukraine this was demonstrated in putins visit to tashkent in may 2000 after lukewarm relations under yeltsin and islam karimov who had long distanced itself from moscow246 in another meeting in 2014 russia agreed to write off uzbek debt247 a theme of a greater soviet region including the former ussr and many of its neighbors or imperialera statesrather than just postsoviet russiahas been consistent in putins may day speeches248249250 on 22 december 2022 putin addressed the security council in a speech where he did not use the term special military operation but instead called the fighting in ukraine a war antiputin activists have called for putin to be prosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the special military operation a war this law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail251 on 25 december he openly declared in a tv interview that the goal of the invasion is to unite the russian people252 on 14 december 2023 president putin held a press conference where he indicated that russian would only negotiate with ukraine when we achieve our objectives he stated that another mobilization wasnt required as 617000 russian soldiers were fighting in ukraine253 during the 2024 yearend review president putin was asked if there were regrets from the special military operation president putin said that he regretted not launching it at the same time as the annexation of crimea and with more preparation saying this decision which was made at the beginning of 2022 should have been made earlier thats the first thing secondly we should have started preparing including for the smo the events in crimea were spontaneous the events of 2022 also began without preparation but why did we start because it was impossible to stand still and endure any longer254 under putin russias relationships with nato and the us have passed through several stages when he first became president relations were cautious but after the 911 attacks putin quickly supported the us in the war on terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared255 according to stephen f cohen the us repaid by further expansion of nato to russias borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty255 but others pointed out the applications from new countries willing to join nato was driven primarily by russians behavior in chechnya transnistria abkhazia yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore ussr in its previous borders by prominent russian politicians256257 from 2003 when russia strongly opposed the us when it waged the iraq war putin became ever more distant from the west and relations steadily deteriorated according to russia scholar stephen f cohen the narrative of the mainstream us media following that of the white house became antiputin255 in an interview with michael strmer putin said there were three questions which most concerned russia and eastern europe namely the status of kosovo the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe and american plans to build missile defence sites in poland and the czech republic and suggested that all three were linked258 his view was that concessions by the west on one of the questions might be met with concessions from russia on another258 one single center of power one single center of force one single center of decision making this is the world of one master one sovereign primarily the united states has overstepped its national borders and in every area in a january 2007 interview putin said russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law260 in february 2007 putin criticized what he called the united states monopolistic dominance in global relations and almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations he said the result of it is that no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race261 this came to be known as the munich speech and nato secretary jaap de hoop scheffer called the speech disappointing and not helpful262 the months following putins munich speech261 were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the atlantic both russian and american officials however denied the idea of a new cold war263 putin publicly opposed plans for the us missile shield in europe and presented president george w bush with a counterproposal on 7 june 2007 which was declined264 russia suspended its participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty on 11 december 2007265 putin opposed kosovos unilateral declaration of independence from serbia on 17 february 2008 warning that it would destabilize the whole system of international relations266 he described the recognition of kosovos independence by several major world powers as a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries and that they have not thought through the results of what they are doing at the end of the day it is a twoended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face267 in march 2014 putin used kosovos declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of crimea citing the socalled kosovo independence precedent268269 after the 911 attacks on the us in 2001 putin had good relations with american president george w bush and many western european leaders his cooler and more businesslike relationship with german chancellor angela merkel is often attributed to merkels upbringing in the former ddr where putin was stationed as a kgb agent270 he had a very friendly and warm relationship with prime minister of italy silvio berlusconi271 the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after berlusconis resignation in november 2011272 when berlusconi died in 2023 putin described him as an extraordinary man and a true friend273274 the natoled military intervention in libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders including putin who said that the united nations security council resolution 1973 is defective and flawed adding it allows everything it resembles medieval calls for crusades275 in late 2013 russianamerican relations deteriorated further when the united states canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after putin gave asylum to american edward snowden who had leaked massive amounts of classified information from the nsa276277 in 2014 russia was suspended from the g8 group as a result of its annexation of crimea278279 putin gave a speech highly critical of the united states accusing them of destabilizing

kingdom deteriorated when the united kingdom granted political asylum to putins former patron oligarch boris berezovsky295 this deterioration was intensified by allegations that the british were spying and making secret payments to prodemocracy and human rights groups296 a survey conducted in the united kingdom in 2022 found putin to be among the least popular foreign leaders with 8 of british respondents holding a positive opinion297 the end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning in london of former kgb and fsb officer alexander

rating climbed to 89 an alltime high352353354 observers saw putins high approval ratings in 2010s as a consequence of improvements in living standards and russias reassertion on the world scene during his presidency355356 putin was also highly popular in some nonwestern countries such as vietnam where his approval rating was 89 in 2017357 despite high approval for putin public confidence in the

stated in 2015 that drawing conclusions from russian poll results or comparing them to polls in democratic states was irrelevant as there is no real political competition in russia where unlike in democratic states russian voters are not offered any credible alternatives and public opinion is primarily formed by statecontrolled media which promotes those in power and discredits alternative candidates396 putin has cultivated a cult of personality for himself399400401 with an outdoorsy athletic tough guy public image demonstrating his physical prowess and taking part in unusual or
