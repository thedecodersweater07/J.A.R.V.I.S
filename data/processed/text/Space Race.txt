the space race russian romanized kosmicheskaya gonka ipa ksmitskj onk was a 20thcentury competition between the cold war rivals the united states and the soviet union to achieve superior spaceflight capability it had its origins in the ballistic missilebased nuclear arms race between the two nations following world war ii and the onset of the cold war the technological advantage demonstrated by spaceflight achievement was seen as necessary for national security particularly in regard to intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite reconnaissance capability but also became part of the cultural symbolism and ideology of the time the space race brought pioneering launches of artificial satellites robotic landers to the moon venus and mars and human spaceflight in low earth orbit and ultimately to the moon1234 public interest in space travel originated in the 1951 publication of a soviet youth magazine and was promptly picked up by us magazines5 the competition began on july 29 1955 when the united states announced its intent to launch artificial satellites for the international geophysical year five days later the soviet union responded by declaring they would also launch a satellite in the near future the launching of satellites was enabled by developments in ballistic missile capabilities since the end of world war ii6 the competition gained western public attention with the sputnik crisis when the ussr achieved the first successful satellite launch sputnik 1 on october 4 1957 it gained momentum when the ussr sent the first human yuri gagarin into space with the orbital flight of vostok 1 on april 12 1961 these were followed by a string of other firsts achieved by the soviets over the next few years789 gagarins flight led us president john f kennedy to raise the stakes on may 25 1961 by asking the us congress to commit to the goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the decade102 both countries began developing super heavylift launch vehicles with the us successfully deploying the saturn v which was large enough to send a threeperson orbiter and twoperson lander to the moon kennedys moon landing goal was achieved in july 1969 with the flight of apollo 11111213 the ussr continued to pursue crewed lunar programs to launch and land on the moon before the us with its n1 rocket but did not succeed and eventually canceled it to concentrate on salyut the first space station program and the first landings on venus and on mars meanwhile the us landed five more apollo crews on the moon14 and continued exploration of other extraterrestrial bodies robotically a period of dtente followed with the april 1972 agreement on a cooperative apollosoyuz test project astp resulting in the july 1975 rendezvous in earth orbit of a us astronaut crew with a soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard apas75 being considered as the final act of the space race by many observers15 the competition was however only gradually replaced with cooperation16 the collapse of the soviet union eventually allowed the us and the newly reconstituted russian federation to end their cold war competition also in space by agreeing in 1993 on the shuttlemir and international space station programs1718 although germans americans and soviets experimented with small liquidfuel rockets before world war ii launching satellites and humans into space required the development of larger ballistic missiles such as wernher von brauns aggregat4 a4 which became known as the vergeltungswaffe 2 v2 developed by nazi germany to bomb the allies in the war19 after the war both the us and ussr acquired custody of german rocket development assets which they used to leverage the development of their own missiles public interest in space flight was first aroused in october 1951 when the soviet rocketry engineer mikhail tikhonravov published flight to the moon in the newspaper pionerskaya pravda for young readers he described a twoperson interplanetary spaceship of the future and the industrial and technological processes required to create it he ended the short article with a clear forecast of the future we do not have long to wait we can assume that the bold dream of konstantin tsiolkovsky will be realized within the next 10 to 15 years20 from march 1952 to april 1954 the us colliers magazine reacted with a series of seven articles man will conquer space soon detailing wernher von brauns plans for crewed spaceflight in march 1955 disneylands animated episode man in space which was broadcast on us television with an audience of about 40 million people eventually fired the public enthusiasm for space travel and raised government interest both in the us and ussr soon after the end of world war ii the two former allies became engaged in a state of political conflict and military tension known as the cold war 19471991 which polarized europe between the soviet unions satellite states often referred to as the eastern bloc and the states of the western world allied with the us21 in august 1949 the soviet union became the second nuclear power after the united states with the successful rds1 nuclear weapon test in october 1957 the soviet union conducted the worlds first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm this was the r7 semyorka also known as ss6 by nato and was seen as capable of striking us territory with a nuclear payload2223 fears in the us due to this perceived threat became known as the missile gap the first american icbm the atlas missile was tested in late 19582224 icbms presented the ability to strike targets on the other side of the globe in a very short amount of time and in a manner which was impervious to air interception such as bombers might have been the value which icbms presented in a nuclear standoff were very substantial and this fact greatly accelerated efforts to develop rocket and rocket interception technology25 the first soviet development of artillery rockets was in 1921 when the soviet military sanctioned the gas dynamics laboratory a small research laboratory to explore solidfuel rockets led by nikolai tikhomirov who had begun studying solid and liquidfueled rockets in 1894 and obtained a patent in 1915 for selfpropelled aerial and watersurface mines2627 the first testfiring of a solid fuel rocket was carried out in 192828 further development was carried out in the 1930s by the group for the study of reactive motion gird where soviet rocket pioneers sergey korolev friedrich zander mikhail tikhonravov and leonid dushkin29 launched girdx the first soviet liquidfueled rocket in 193330 in 1933 the two design bureaus were combined into the reactive scientific research institute31 and produced the rp318 the ussrs first rocketpowered aircraft and the rs82 and rs132 missiles32 which became the basis for the katyusha multiple rocket launcher3334 during the 1930s soviet rocket technology was comparable to germanys35 but joseph stalins great purge from 1936 to 1938 severely damaged its progress in 1945 the soviets captured several key nazi german a4 v2 rocket production facilities and also gained the services of some german scientists and engineers related to the project a4s were assembled and studied and the experience derived from assembling and launching a4 rockets was directly applied to the soviet copy called the r13637 with nii88 chief designer sergei korolev overseeing the r1s development38 the r1 entered into service in the soviet army on 28 november 19503940 by the latter half of 1946 korolev and rocket engineer valentin glushko had with extensive input from german engineers outlined a successor to the r1 the r2 with an extended frame and a new engine designed by glushko41 which entered service in november 1951 with a range of 600 kilometres 370 mi twice that of the r142 this was followed in 1951 with the development of the r5 pobeda the soviet unions first real strategic missile with a range of 1200 km 750 mi and capable of carrying a 1 megaton mt thermonuclear warhead the r5 entered service in 195543 scientific versions of the r1 r2 and r5 undertook various experiments between 1949 and 1958 including flights with space dogs44 2123 design work began in 1953 on the r7 semyorka with the requirement for a missile with a launch mass of 170 to 200 tons range of 8500 km and carrying a 3000 kg 6600 lb nuclear warhead powerful enough to launch a nuclear warhead against the united states in late 1953 the warheads mass was increased to 55 to 6 tons to accommodate the then planned theromonuclear bomb4546 the r7 was designed in a twostage configuration with four boosters that would jettison when empty47 on the 21 august 1957 the r7 flew 6000 km 3700 mi and became the worldss first intercontinental ballistic missile4846 two months later the r7 launched sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite into orbit and became the basis for the r7 family which includes sputnik luna molniya vostok and voskhod space launchers as well as later soyuz variants several versions are still in use and it has become the worlds most reliable space launcher4950 although american rocket pioneer robert h goddard developed patented and flew small liquidpropellant rockets as early as 1914 the united states was the only one of the three major allied world war ii powers to not have its own rocket program until von braun and his engineers were expatriated from nazi germany in 1945 the us acquired a large number of v2 rockets and recruited von braun and most of his engineering team in operation paperclip51 the team was sent to the armys white sands proving ground in new mexico in 194552 they set about assembling the captured v2s and began a program of launching them and instructing american engineers in their operation53 these tests led to the first photos of earth from space and the first twostage rocket the wac corporalv2 combination in 194953 the german rocket team was moved from fort bliss to the armys new redstone arsenal located in huntsville alabama in 195054 from here von braun and his team developed the armys first operational mediumrange ballistic missile the redstone rocket derivatives of which launched both americas first satellite and the first piloted mercury space missions54 it became the basis for both the jupiter and saturn family of rockets54 each of the united states armed services had its own icbm development program the air force began icbm research in 1945 with the mx77455 in 1950 von braun began testing the air force pgm11 redstone rocket family at cape canaveral56 by 1957 a descendant of the air force mx774 received toppriority funding55 and evolved into the atlasa the first successful american icbm55 the atlas made use of a thin stainless steel fuel tank which relied on the internal pressure of the tank for structural integrity this allowed an overall lighter weight design57 wd40 was developed to prevent rust on the atlas rockets so that rust protecting paint could be avoided to further reduce weight5859 a later variant of the atlas the atlasd served as a nuclear icbm and as the orbital launch vehicle for project mercury and the remotecontrolled agena target vehicle used in project gemini55 the period from 1955 to 1960 saw the first artificial satellites put into earth orbit by both the ussr and the us the first animals sent into orbit and the first robotic probes to impact and flyby the moon by the soviets in 1955 with both the united states and the soviet union building ballistic missiles that could be used to launch objects into space the stage was set for nationalistic competition6 on july 29 1955 james c hagerty president dwight d eisenhowers press secretary announced that the united states intended to launch small earth circling satellites between july 1 1957 and december 31 1958 as part of the us contribution to the international geophysical year igy6 on august 2 at the sixth congress of the international astronautical federation in copenhagen scientist leonid i sedov told international reporters at the soviet embassy of his countrys intention to launch a satellite as well in the near future6 on august 30 1955 sergei korolev succeeded in convincing the soviet academy of sciences to establish a commission dedicated to achieving the goal of launching a satellite into earth orbit before the united states6 this can be viewed as the de facto start date of the space race the council of ministers of the soviet union began a policy of treating development of its space program as topsecret when the sputnik project was first approved one of the immediate courses of action the politburo took was to consider what to announce to the world regarding their event the telegraph agency of the soviet union tass established precedents for all official announcements on the soviet space program the information eventually released did not offer details on who built and launched the satellite or why it was launched60 the soviet space programs use of secrecy served as both a tool to prevent the leaking of classified information between countries and to avoid revealing specifics to the soviet populace in regards to their short and long term goals the programs nature embodied ambiguous messages concerning its goals successes and values launches were not announced until they took place cosmonaut names were not released until they flew and outside observers did not know the size or shape of their rockets or cabins of most of their spaceships except for the first sputniks lunar probes and venus probe61 the soviet military maintained control over the space program korolevs okb1 design bureau was subordinated under the ministry of general machine building60 tasked with the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and continued to give its assets random identifiers into the 1960s60 information about failures was systematically withheld historian james andrews notes that soviet media coverage of the space program particularly human space missions rarely reported any failures or difficulties creating the impression of a flawless operation with almost no exceptions coverage of soviet space exploits especially in the case of human space missions omitted reports of failure or trouble60 dominic phelan noted in the book cold war space sleuths springerpraxis 2013 the ussr was famously described by winston churchill as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma and nothing signified this more than the search for the truth behind its space program during the cold war although the space race was literally played out above our heads it was often obscured by a figurative space curtain that took much effort to see through61 initially president eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometers 62 mi might be seen as violating that nations airspace62 he was concerned that the soviet union would accuse the americans of an illegal overflight thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense63 eisenhower and his advisors were of the opinion that a nations airspace sovereignty did not extend past the krmn line and they used the 195758 international geophysical year launches to establish this principle in international law62 eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a warmonger if he were to use military missiles as launchers therefore he selected the untried naval research laboratorys vanguard rocket which was a researchonly rocket64 this meant that von brauns team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their jupiterc rocket because of its intended use as a future military vehicle64 on september 20 1956 von braun and his team did launch a jupiterc that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of reentry vehicle technology64 korolev received word about von brauns 1956 jupiterc test and mistakenly thinking it was a satellite mission that failed expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit since the r7 was substantially more powerful than any of the us launch vehicles he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing object d as his primary satellite65 it was given the designation d to distinguish it from other r7 payload designations a b v and g which were nuclear weapon payloads66 object d dwarfed the proposed us satellites having a weight of 1400 kilograms 3100 lb of which 300 kilograms 660 lb would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the earth take readings on radiation levels and check on the planets magnetic field66 however things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite so in february 1957 korolev sought and received permission from the council of ministers to build a prosteishy sputnik ps1 or simple satellite65 the council also decreed that object d be postponed until april 195867 the new sputnik was a metallic sphere that would be a much lighter craft weighing 838 kilograms 185 lb and having a 58centimeter 23 in diameter68 the satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that object d had but had two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull and the ability to detect the density of the earths thermosphere69 korolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of the r7 rocket in august and september which paved the way for the launch of sputnik70 word came that the us was planning to announce a major breakthrough at an international geophysical year conference at the national academy of sciences in washington dc with a paper titled satellite over the planet on october 6 195771 korolev anticipated that von braun might launch a jupiterc with a satellite payload on or around october 4 or 5 in conjunction with the paper71 he hastened the launch moving it to october 471 the launch vehicle for ps1 was a modified r7 vehicle 8k71ps number m1ps without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches70 it arrived at the soviet missile base tyuratam in september and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one70 the first launch took place on friday october 4 1957 at exactly 102834 pm moscow time with the r7 and the now named sputnik 1 satellite lifting off the launch pad and placing the artificial moon into an orbit a few minutes later72 this fellow traveler as the name is translated in english was a small beeping ball less than two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds but the celebrations were muted at the launch control center until the downrange far east tracking station at kamchatka received the first distinctive beep beep beep sounds from sputnik 1s radio transmitters indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit72 about 95 minutes after launch the satellite flew over its launch site and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at tyuratam thats when korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into earthorbit73 the next satellite sent by the soviets after sputnik 1 was sputnik 2 launched on november 3 1957 just a month later this would put the first animal into orbit7475 at the latest the successful start of sputnik 2 with the satellite weighing more than 500 kg proved that the ussr had achieved a leading advantage in rocket technology the cia initially astonished estimated the launch weight of the rocket at 500 metric tons requiring an initial thrust exceeding 1000 tons and assumed the use of a threestage rocket in a classified report the agency described the event as a stupendous scientific achievement and concluded that the ussr had likely perfected an intercontinental ballistic missile icbm capable of accurately targeting any location76 in reality the launch weight of the soviet rocket was 267 metric tons with an initial thrust of 410 tons with one and a half stages the cias misjudgement was caused by extrapolating the parameters of the us atlas rocket developed at the same time launch weight 82 tons initial thrust 135 tons maximum payload of 70 kg for low earth orbit77 in part the favourable data of the soviet launcher was based on concepts proposed by the german rocket scientists headed by helmut grttrup on gorodomlya island such as among other things the rigorous weight saving the control of the residual fuel quantities and a reduced thrust to weight relation of 14 instead of usual factor 278 the cia had heard about such details already in january 1954 when it interrogated gttrup after his return from the ussr but did not take him seriously79 the soviet success raised a great deal of concern in the united states for example economist bernard baruch wrote in an open letter titled the lessons of defeat to the new york herald tribune while we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets the soviet union is conquering space it is russia not the united states who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it america is worried it should be80 eisenhower ordered project vanguard to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned81 the december 6 1957 project vanguard launch failure occurred at cape canaveral air force station in florida it was a monumental failure exploding a few seconds after launch and it became an international joke the satellite appeared in newspapers under the names flopnik stayputnik kaputnik82 and dudnik83 in the united nations the soviet delegate offered the us representative aid under the soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations82 only in the wake of this very public failure did von brauns redstone team get the goahead to launch their jupiterc rocket as soon as they could in britain the uss western cold war ally the reaction was mixed some celebrated the fact that the soviets had reached space first while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring84 the daily express predicted that the us would catch up to and pass the ussr in space never doubt for a moment that america would be successful85 on january 31 1958 nearly four months after the launch of sputnik 1 von braun and the united states successfully launched its first satellite on a fourstage juno i rocket derived from the us armys redstone missile at cape canaveral86 the satellite explorer 1 was 3066 pounds 1391 kg in mass86 the payload of explorer 1 weighed 1835 pounds 832 kg it carried a micrometeorite gauge and a geigermller tube it passed in and out of the earthencompassing radiation belt with its 194by1368nauticalmile 360 by 2534 km orbit therefore saturating the tubes capacity and proving what dr james van allen a space scientist at the university of iowa had theorized86 the belt named the van allen radiation belt is a doughnutshaped zone of highlevel radiation intensity around the earth above the magnetic equator87 van allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of explorer 1 the satellite measured three phenomena cosmic ray and radiation levels the temperature in the spacecraft and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites the satellite had no memory for data storage therefore it had to transmit continuously88 the next successful mission was explorer 3 launched later that month march 26 1958 which carried similar scientific instruments and successfully recorded cosmic ray data899091 on april 2 1958 president eisenhower reacted to the soviet space lead in launching the first satellite by recommending to the us congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities congress led by senate majority leader lyndon b johnson responded by passing the national aeronautics and space act which eisenhower signed into law on july 29 1958 this law turned the national advisory committee on aeronautics into the national aeronautics and space administration nasa it also created a civilianmilitary liaison committee appointed by the president responsible for coordinating the nations civilian and military space programs92 on october 21 1959 eisenhower approved the transfer of the armys remaining spacerelated activities to nasa on july 1 1960 the redstone arsenal became nasas george c marshall space flight center with von braun as its first director development of the saturn rocket family which when mature gave the us parity with the soviets in terms of lifting capability was thus transferred to nasa93 the us and the ussr sent animals into space to determine the safety of the environment before sending the first humans the ussr used dogs for this purpose and the us used monkeys and apes the first mammal in space was albert ii a rhesus monkey launched by the us on a suborbital flight on june 14 1949 who died on landing due to a parachute malfunction94 the ussr sent the dog laika into orbit on sputnik 2 the second satellite launched on november 3 1957 for an intended tenday flight74 they did not yet have the technology to return laika safely to earth and the government reported laika died when the oxygen ran out95 but in october 2002 her true cause of death was reported as stress and overheating on the fourth orbit96 due to failure of the air conditioning system97 at a moscow press conference in 1998 oleg gazenko a senior soviet scientist involved in the project stated the more time passes the more im sorry about it we did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog98 in 1958 korolev upgraded the r7 to be able to launch a 400kilogram 880 lb payload to the moon the luna program began with three failed secret 1958 attempts to launch luna e1class impactor probes99 the fourth attempt luna 1 launched successfully on january 2 1959 but missed the moon the fifth attempt on june 18 also failed at launch the 390kilogram 860 lb luna 2 successfully impacted the moon on september 14 1959 the 2785kilogram 614 lb luna 3 successfully flew by the moon and sent back pictures of its far side on october 7 1959100 the us first embarked on the pioneer program in 1958 by launching the first probe albeit ending in failure a subsequent probe named pioneer 1 was launched with the intention of orbiting the moon only to result in a partial mission success when it reached an apogee of 113800 km before falling back to earth the missions of pioneer 2 and pioneer 3 failed whereas pioneer 4 had one partially successful lunar flyby in march 1959101102 the period from 1961 to 1968 began with the first men sent to space the first robotic explorations of other planets with missions to venus and mars conducted by both the soviet union and the united states robotic landings on the moon and the gestation of us ambition to land a man on the moon the 1960s saw significant advancements in crewed spaceflight by both cold war adversaries as well as the first nuclear detonation in space research into antisatellite technology and the signing of historic international outer space treaties the soviets designed their first human space capsule using the same spacecraft bus as their zenit spy satellite103 forcing them to keep the details and true appearance secret until after the vostok program was over the craft consisted of a spherical descent module with a mass of 246 tonnes 5400 lb and a diameter of 23 meters 75 ft with a cylindrical inner cabin housing the cosmonaut instruments and escape system and a biconic instrument module with a mass of 227 tonnes 5000 lb 225 meters 74 ft long and 243 meters 80 ft in diameter containing the engine system and propellant after reentry the cosmonaut would eject at about 7000 meters 23000 ft over the ussr and descend via parachute while the capsule would land separately because the descent module made an extremely rough landing that could have left a cosmonaut seriously injured104 the vostok spaceship was first displayed at the july 1961 tushino air show mounted on its launch vehicles third stage with the nose cone in place concealing the spherical capsule a tail section with eight fins was added in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers this also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary105 the soviets finally revealed the true appearance of their vostok capsule at the april 1965 moscow economic exhibition106 on april 12 1961 the ussr surprised the world by launching yuri gagarin into a single 108minute orbit around the earth in a craft called vostok 1104 they dubbed gagarin the first cosmonaut roughly translated from russian and greek as sailor of the universe gagarins capsule was flown in automatic mode since doctors did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space but gagarin was given an envelope containing the code that would unlock manual control in an emergency104 gagarin became a national hero of the soviet union and the eastern bloc and a worldwide celebrity moscow and other cities in the ussr held mass demonstrations the scale of which was second only to the world war ii victory parade of 1945107 april 12 was declared cosmonautics day in the ussr and is celebrated today in russia as one of the official commemorative dates of russia108 in 2011 it was declared the international day of human space flight by the united nations109 the ussr demonstrated 24hour launch pad turnaround and launched two piloted spacecraft vostok 3 and vostok 4 in essentially identical orbits on august 11 and 12 1962110 the two spacecraft came within approximately 65 kilometers 35 nautical miles of one another close enough for radio communication111 but then drifted as far apart as 2850 kilometers 1540 nautical miles the vostok had no maneuvering rockets to keep the two craft a controlled distance apart112 vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space the first woman valentina tereshkova was launched into space on vostok 6 on june 16 1963113 as possibly a medical experiment she was the only one to fly of a small group of female parachutist factory workers unlike the male cosmonauts who were military test pilots114 chosen by the head of cosmonaut training because he read a tabloid article about the mercury 13 group of women wanting to become astronauts and got the mistaken idea that nasa was actually entertaining this115113 five months after her flight tereshkova married vostok 3 cosmonaut andriyan nikolayev116 and they had a daughter117 the us air force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space named man in space soonest this program studied several different types of oneman space vehicles settling on a ballistic reentry capsule launched on a derivative atlas missile and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots after nasas creation the program was transferred over to the civilian agencys space task group and renamed project mercury on november 26 1958 the mercury spacecraft was designed by the stgs chief engineer maxime faget nasa selected a new group of astronaut from the greek for star sailor candidates from navy air force and marine test pilots and narrowed this down to a group of seven for the program capsule design and astronaut training began immediately working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the redstone missile followed by orbital flights on the atlas each flight series would first start unpiloted then carry a nonhuman primate then finally humans118 the mercury spacecrafts principal designer was maxime faget who started research for human spaceflight during the time of the naca119 it consisted of a conical capsule with a cylindrical pack of three solidfuel retrorockets strapped over a beryllium or fiberglass heat shield on the blunt end base diameter at the blunt end was 60 feet 18 m and length was 108 feet 33 m with the launch escape system added the overall length was 259 feet 79 m120 with 100 cubic feet 28 m3 of habitable volume the capsule was just large enough for a single astronaut121 the first suborbital spacecraft weighed 3000 pounds 1400 kg the heaviest mercuryatlas 9 weighed 3000 pounds 1400 kg fully loaded122 on reentry the astronaut would stay in the craft through splashdown by parachute in the atlantic ocean on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american in space launching in a ballistic trajectory on mercuryredstone 3 in a spacecraft he named freedom 7123 though he did not achieve orbit like gagarin he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecrafts attitude and retrorocket firing124 after his successful return shepard was celebrated as a national hero honored with parades in washington new york and los angeles and received the nasa distinguished service medal from president john f kennedy125 american virgil gus grissom repeated shepards suborbital flight in liberty bell 7 on july 21 1961126 almost a year after the soviet union put a human into orbit astronaut john glenn became the first american to orbit the earth on february 20 1962127 his mercuryatlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the friendship 7 spacecraft and splashed down safely in the atlantic ocean after a tense reentry due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heatshield127 on february 23 1962 president kennedy awarded glenn with the nasa distinguished service medal in a ceremony at cape canaveral air force station128 as the first american in orbit glenn became a national hero and received a tickertape parade in new york city reminiscent of that given for charles lindbergh the united states launched three more mercury flights after glenns aurora 7 on may 24 1962 duplicated glenns three orbits sigma 7 on october 3 1962 six orbits and faith 7 on may 15 1963 22 orbits 324 hours the maximum capability of the spacecraft nasa at first intended to launch one more mission extending the spacecrafts endurance to three days but since this would not beat the soviet record it was decided instead to concentrate on developing project gemini129 these are extraordinary times and we face an extraordinary challenge our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedoms cause if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all as did the sputnik in 1957 the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take now it is time to take longer strides time for a great new american enterprise time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth recognizing the head start obtained by the soviets with their large rocket engines which gives them many months of leadtime and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish let it be clear that i am asking the congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of actiona course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs 531 million dollars in fiscal 62an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years if we are to go only half way or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty in my judgment it would be better not to go at all before gagarins flight us president john f kennedys support for americas piloted space program was lukewarm jerome wiesner of mit who served as a science advisor to presidents eisenhower and kennedy and himself an opponent of sending humans into space remarked if kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment he would have130 as late as march 1961 when nasa administrator james e webb submitted a budget request to fund a moon landing before 1970 kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive131 some were surprised by kennedys eventual support of nasa and the space program because of how often he had attacked the eisenhower administrations inefficiency during the election132 gagarins flight changed this now kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the american public over the soviet lead additionally the bay of pigs invasion planned before his term began but executed during it was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the us forces133 looking for something to save political face he sent a memo dated april 20 1961 to vice president lyndon b johnson asking him to look into the state of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up134 the two major options at the time were either the establishment of an earth orbital space station or a crewed landing on the moon johnson in turn consulted with von braun who answered kennedys questions based on his estimates of us and soviet rocket lifting capability135 based on this johnson responded to kennedy concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership and recommending that the crewed moon landing was far enough in the future that the us had a fighting chance to achieve it first136 kennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the apollo program and on may 25 took the opportunity to ask for congressional support in a cold war speech titled special message on urgent national needs full text he justified the program in terms of its importance to national security and its focus of the nations energies on other scientific and social fields137 he rallied popular support for the program in his we choose to go to the moon speech on september 12 1962 before a large crowd at rice university stadium in houston texas near the construction site of the new lyndon b johnson space center facility137 full text khrushchev responded to kennedys challenge with silence refusing to publicly confirm or deny the soviets were pursuing a moon race138 as later disclosed the soviet union secretly pursued two competing crewed lunar programs soviet decree 655268 on work on the exploration of the moon and mastery of space issued in august 1964 directed vladimir chelomei to develop a moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966 and directed korolev to develop the moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967139 in september 1965 chelomeis flyby program was assigned to korolev who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own soyuz 7kl1 spacecraft and chelomeis proton rocket after korolevs death in january 1966 another government decree of february 1967 moved the first crewed flyby to mid1967 and the first crewed landing to the end of 1968140141 after a first usussr drydenblagonravov agreement and cooperation on the echo ii balloon satellite in 196216 president kennedy proposed on september 20 1963 in a speech before the united nations general assembly that the united states and the soviet union join forces in an effort to reach the moon142 kennedy thus changed his mind regarding the desirability of the space race preferring instead to ease tensions with the soviet union by cooperating on projects such as a joint lunar landing143 soviet premier nikita khrushchev initially rejected kennedys proposal144 however on october 2 1997 it was reported that khrushchevs son sergei claimed khrushchev was poised to accept kennedys proposal at the time of kennedys assassination on november 22 1963 during the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture and decided to accept kennedys offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the worlds two superpowers but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he lacked the same trust for kennedys successor lyndon johnson144 some cooperation in robotic space exploration nevertheless did take place145 such as a combined venera 4mariner 5 data analysis under a joint sovietamerican working group of cospar in 1969 allowing a more complete drawing of the profile of the atmosphere of venus146147 eventually the apollosoyuz mission was realized afterall which furthermore laid the foundations for the shuttlemir program and the iss as president johnson steadfastly pursued the gemini and apollo programs promoting them as kennedys legacy to the american public one week after kennedys death he issued executive order 11129 renaming the cape canaveral and apollo launch facilities after kennedy the ranger program started in 1959 by nasas jet propulsion laboratory aimed to conduct hard impacts on the moon and had its first success in 1962 after three failures due to launch aborts ranger 1 and ranger 2 and a failure to reach the moon ranger 3 when the 730pound 330 kg ranger 4 became the first us spacecraft to reach the moon but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the moon by 725 kilometers 391 nmi on october 21 1962 the first successful ranger mission was the 806pound 366 kg block iii ranger 7 which impacted on july 31 1964148 ranger had three successful impacts out of nine attempts149 in 1963 the soviet unions 2nd generation luna programme was less successful than the earlier luna probes luna 4 luna 5 luna 6 luna 7 and luna 8 were all met with mission failures however in 1966 the luna 9 achieved the first softlanding on the moon and successfully transmitted photography from the surface150 luna 10 marked the first manmade object to establish an orbit around the moon151 followed by luna 11 luna 12 and luna 14 which also successfully established orbits luna 12 was able to transmit detailed photography of the surface from orbit152 luna 10 12 and luna 14 conducted gamma ray spectrometry of the moon among other tests the zond programme was orchestrated alongside the luna programme with zond 1 and zond 2 launching in 1964 intended as flyby missions however both failed153154 zond 3 however was successful and transmitted high quality photography from the far side of the moon155156 partly to aid the apollo missions the surveyor program was conducted by nasa with five successful soft landings out of seven attempts from 1966 to 1968 the lunar orbiter program had five successes out of five attempts in 19661967157158 in late 1966 luna 13 became the third spacecraft to make a softlanding on the moon with the american surveyor 1 having now taken second luna 13 made use of inflatable airbags to soften its landing159160161 surveyor 1 was a 995 kg lander notably larger than the 112 kg luna 13 e6m lander159162 surveyor 1 was equipped with a doppler velocity sensing system that fed information into the spacecraft computer to implement a controllable descent to the surface each of the three landing pads also carried aircrafttype shock absorbers and strain gauges to provide data on landing characteristics important for future apollo missions163164 surveyor 3 which successfully touched down on the moon april 20 1967 carried a surface sampler which facilitated tests of the lunar soil based on these experiments scientists concluded that lunar soil had a consistency similar to wet sand with a bearing strength of about 10 pounds per square inch 07 kilograms per square centimeter or 98 kilopascals which was concluded to be solid enough to support an apollo lunar module165 the surveyor 3 lander would be later visited by apollo 12 astronauts166 on nov 17 1967 before mission termination surveyor 6 fired its thrusters for 25 seconds becoming the first spacecraft launched from the lunar surface it rose about 10 feet 3 meters before landing 8 feet 25 meters west of its original spot cameras then examined the original landing site to assess the soils properties167168 from the early 1960s both cold war adversaries almost simultaneously initiated their own programmes which sought to reach other planets in the solar system for the first time namely venus and mars venus was of great interest in the field of planetary science due to its thick and opaque atmosphere the atmospheres of other planets being a novel area of research at the time in 1961 the venera programme was initiated by the soviet union with the launch of venera 1 the programme would go on to mark many firsts in the exploration of another planet despite the later successes however venera 1 and venera 2 intended to flyby venus resulted in failure due to losses of contact169170 nasa would then initiate the mariner program with the launch of mariner 1 and mariner 2 mariner 1 failed shortly after launch171 however mariner 2 would become the first manmade object to flyby another planet in december 1962 when the probe passed by venus172173 later in 196566 venera 3 marked the first time a manmade object made contact with another planet after it impacted venus on march 1 1966 despite operational difficulties resulting in loss of contact with the craft174 in 1967 mariner 5 flew by venus and conducted atmospheric analysis175 in 1964 nasas mariner 4 became the first successful mars flyby transmitting 21 pictures of the planets surface this was followed by mariner 6 and 7 in 1969 focused by the commitment to a moon landing in january 1962 the us announced project gemini a twoperson spacecraft that would support the later threeperson apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft flight durations of sufficient length to go to the moon and back and extravehicular activity to perform work outside the spacecraft176177 meanwhile korolev had planned further longterm missions for the vostok spacecraft and had four vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his okb1 facilities178 the americans announced plans for gemini represented major advances over the mercury and vostok capsules and korolev felt the need to try to beat the americans to many of these innovations178 he had already begun designing the vostoks replacement the nextgeneration soyuz a multicosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the gemini spacecraft179 soyuz would not be available for at least three years and it could not be called upon to deal with this new american challenge in 1964 or 1965180 political pressure in early 1964 which some sources claim was from khrushchev while other sources claim was from other communist party officials pushed him to modify his four remaining vostoks to beat the americans to new space firsts in the size of flight crews and the duration of missions178 korolevs conversion of his surplus vostok capsules to the voskhod spacecraft allowed the soviet space program to beat the gemini program in achieving the first spaceflight with a multiperson crew and the first spacewalk gemini took a year longer than planned to make its first flight so voskhod 1 became the first spaceflight with a threeperson crew on october 12 1964181 the ussr touted another technological achievement during this mission it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirtsleeveenvironment182 however flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the soviet spacecrafts environmental systems rather this was because the crafts limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization182 this was not repeated until the us apollo command module flew in 1968 the command module cabin was designed to transport three astronauts in a low pressure pure oxygen shirtsleeve environment while in space on march 18 1965 about a week before the first piloted project gemini space flight the ussr launched the twocosmonaut voskhod 2 mission with pavel belyayev and alexei leonov183 voskhod 2s design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity eva also known as a spacewalk while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsules electronics would not overheat184 leonov performed the firstever eva as part of the mission183 a fatality was narrowly avoided when leonovs spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space preventing him from reentering the airlock185 to overcome this he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level185 he succeeded in safely reentering the spacecraft but he and belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecrafts atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 pure oxygen which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before reentry186 the reentry involved two more challenges an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers 240 mi off its designated target area the city of perm and the instrument compartments failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry186 by october 16 1964 leonid brezhnev and a small cadre of highranking communist party officials deposed khrushchev as soviet government leader a day after voskhod 1 landed in what was called the wednesday conspiracy187 the new political leaders along with korolev ended the technologically troublesome voskhod program canceling voskhod 3 and 4 which were in the planning stages and started concentrating on reaching the moon188 voskhod 2 ended up being korolevs final achievement before his death on january 14 1966 as it became the last of the space firsts that the ussr achieved during the early 1960s according to historian asif siddiqi korolevs accomplishments marked the absolute zenith of the soviet space program one never ever attained since7 there was a twoyear pause in soviet piloted space flights while voskhods replacement the soyuz spacecraft was designed and developed189 though delayed a year to reach its first flight gemini was able to take advantage of the ussrs twoyear hiatus after voskhod which enabled the us to catch up and surpass the previous soviet superiority in piloted spaceflight gemini had ten crewed missions between march 1965 and november 1966 gemini 3 gemini 4 gemini 5 gemini 6a gemini 7 gemini 8 gemini 9a gemini 10 gemini 11 and gemini 12 and accomplished the following gemini 8 experienced the first inspace mission abort on march 17 1966 just after achieving the worlds first docking when a stuck or shorted thruster sent the craft into an uncontrolled spin command pilot neil armstrong was able to shut off the stuck thruster and stop the spin by using the reentry control system191 he and his crewmate david scott landed and were recovered safely192 most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions in this way project gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts for the apollo lunar missions with the completion of gemini the us had demonstrated many of the key technologies necessary to make kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon namely crewed spacecraft docking with the exception of developing a large enough launch vehicle193 korolevs design bureau produced two prospectuses for circumlunar spaceflight march 1962 and may 1963 the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his soyuz design at the same time another bureau okb52 headed by vladimir chelomey was developing the lk1 lunar flyby spacecraft which would be launched by chelomeys proton ur500 rocket the soviet government rejected korolevs proposals opting to support chelomeys project who gained favor with khrushchev by employing his son194 officially the soviet lunar program was established on august 3 1964 with the adoption of soviet communist party central committee command 655268 on work on the exploration of the moon and mastery of space140 the circumlunar flights were planned to occur in 1967 and the landings to start in 1968 intending to land a person on the moon before the apollo flights195 both of the bureaus submitted their projects for a crewed lunar landing140 korolevs lunar landing program was designated n1l3 for its n1 super rocket and a more advanced soyuz 7kl3 spacecraft also known as the lunar orbital module lunniy orbitalny korabl lok with a crew of two a separate lunar lander lunniy korabl lk would carry a single cosmonaut to the lunar surface195 the n1l3 launch vehicle had three stages to earth orbit a fourth stage for earth departure and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist the combined space vehicle was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the threestage us apollosaturn v and exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28 45400 kn vs 33000 kn196 the n13l was never successfully tested the first flight suffered a fire in the firststage block a due to a loose bolt leading to a catastrophic explosion 70 seconds into the flight further variations of the n1 had similar catastrophic results in testing197 if successful the n1 would have been capable of carrying a 95 metric tons payload into low earth orbit197 the saturn v comparatively used liquid hydrogen fuel in its two upper stages and carried a 1406 metric tons payload to orbit198197 enough for a threeperson orbiter and twoperson lander chelomeys program assumed using a direct ascent lander based on the lk1 lk700 which would be launched using his proposed ur700 rocket following khrushchevs ouster from power chelomey lost his support in the soviet government and his proposal didnt receive any funding additionally in august 1965 due to korolevs opposition work on the lk1 was suspended and later stopped completely as a replacement the circumlunar mission would use a strippeddown soyuz 7kl1 zond while still retaining the proton ur500 booster to fit two crewmembers the zond had to omit the soyuz orbital module sacrificing equipment for habitable cabin volume194199 the us and ussr began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958 presenting issues for debate to the united nations200201202 which created a committee on the peaceful uses of outer space in 1959203 on may 10 1962 vice president johnson addressed the second national conference on the peaceful uses of space revealing that the united states and the ussr both supported a resolution passed by the political committee of the un general assembly in december 1962 which not only urged member nations to extend the rules of international law to outer space but to also cooperate in its exploration following the passing of this resolution kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative american and soviet space program204 in 1963 the partial nuclear test ban treaty was signed by more than 100 signatories including both the united states and the soviet union this treaty followed the us test of a nuclear bomb detonated in outer space the year earlier called starfish prime the un ultimately created a treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies which was signed by the united states the ussr and the united kingdom on january 27 1967 and came into force the following october 10205 this treaty the treaty remains in force signed by 107 member states as of july 2017update in november 1968 dismay gripped the united states central intelligence agency when a successful satellite destruction simulation was successfully orchestrated by the soviet union206 as a part of the istrebitel sputnikov antisatellite weapons research programme the kosmos 248 soviet satellite was successfully destroyed by kosmos 252 which was able to intercept within the 5 km kill radius and destroyed kosmos 248 by detonating its onboard warhead this wasnt the beginning of the programme years earlier intercept attempts had begun with maneuvering test of the polyot satellites in 1964207208209210 possibly as a response to the soviet programme the united states began project saint which was intended to provide antisatellite capability to be used in the case of war with the soviet union211206212 however less is known about the mission profiles of this project compared to the soviet programme and the project was cancelled early on due to budget constraints212 in 1967 both nations space programs faced serious challenges that brought them to temporary halts on january 27 1967 the same day the us and ussr signed the outer space treaty the crew of the first crewed apollo mission command pilot virgil gus grissom senior pilot ed white and pilot roger chaffee were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test less than a month before the planned february 21 launch an investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark and quickly grew out of control fed by the spacecrafts atmosphere of pure oxygen at greater than one standard atmosphere crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the plug door hatch cover against the internal pressure213 the board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft and procedural failings including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pureoxygen atmosphere as well as inadequate safety procedures213 all these flaws had to be corrected over the next twentytwo months until the first piloted flight could be made213 mercury and gemini veteran grissom had been a favored choice of deke slayton nasas director of flight crew operations to make the first piloted landing214 on april 24 1967 the single pilot of soyuz 1 vladimir komarov became the first inflight spaceflight fatality the mission was planned to be a threeday test to include the first soviet docking with an unpiloted soyuz 2 but the mission was plagued with problems problems began shortly after launch when one solar panel failed to unfold leading to a shortage of power for the spacecrafts systems further problems with the orientation detectors complicated maneuvering the craft by orbit 13 the automatic stabilisation system was completely dead and the manual system was only partially effective215 the mission was aborted soyuz 1 fired its retrorockets and reentered the earths atmosphere during the emergency reentry a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute causing descent speed to reach as high as 40 ms 140 kmh 89 mph shortly thereafter soyuz 1 impacted the ground 3 km 19 mi west of karabutak and was found on fire the official autopsy states komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact216217218 in the us during subsequent years stories began circulating that in his last transmissions komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff as he descended or even that he cursed the soviet leadership and that these transmissions were received by an nsa listening station near istanbul219220221 this would contradict soviet records of the radio transcripts and historians such as asif azam siddiqi and robert pearlman regard these claims to be fabrications222223 the united states recovered from the apollo 1 fire fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the block ii command module the us proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the saturn v launch vehicle apollo 4 and apollo 6 and the lunar module apollo 5 during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968224 the first saturn v flight was an unqualified success and although the second suffered some noncatastrophic engine failures it was considered a partial success and the launcher achieved human rating qualification apollo 1s mission to check out the apollo command and service module in earth orbit was accomplished by grissoms backup crew on apollo 7 launched on october 11 1968225 the elevenday mission was a total success as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission paving the way for the united states to continue with its lunar mission schedule226 the soviet union also fixed the parachute and control problems with soyuz and the next piloted mission soyuz 3 was launched on october 26 1968227 the goal was to complete komarovs rendezvous and docking mission with the unpiloted soyuz 2227 ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters 660 ft of each other then cosmonaut georgy beregovoy took control227 he got within 40 meters 130 ft of his target but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft227 the first docking of soviet spacecraft was finally realized in january 1969 by the soyuz 4 and soyuz 5 missions it was the firstever docking of two crewed spacecraft and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another228 the soviet zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968 after six unsuccessful automated test launches kosmos 146 on march 10 1967 kosmos 154 on april 8 1967 zond 1967a on september 28 1967 zond 1967b on november 22 1967 zond 1968a on april 23 1968 and zond 1968b in july 1968229 zond 4 was launched on march 2 1968 and successfully made a circumlunar flight230 but encountered problems with its earth reentry on march 9 and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge 15000 meters 49000 ft over the gulf of guinea231 the soviet official announcement said that zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the atlantic ocean instead of over the ussr230 during the summer of 1968 the apollo program hit another snag the first pilotrated lunar module lm was not ready for orbital tests in time for a december 1968 launch nasa planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order delaying the first lm flight until march 1969 and sending apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the lm in december232 this mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the soviet union might be ready for a piloted zond flight in late 1968233 in september 1968 zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned safely to earth accomplishing the first successful water landing of the soviet space program in the indian ocean234 it also scared nasa planners as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight not piloted because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the moon235 on november 10 1968 another automated test flight zond 6 was launched it encountered difficulties in earth reentry and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early causing it to crashland only 16 kilometers 99 mi from where it had been launched six days earlier236 it turned out there was no chance of a piloted soviet circumlunar flight during 1968 due to the unreliability of the zonds237 on december 21 1968 frank borman james lovell and william anders became the first humans to ride the saturn v rocket into space on apollo 8 they also became the first to leave lowearth orbit and go to another celestial body entering lunar orbit on december 24238 they made ten orbits in twenty hours and transmitted one of the most watched tv broadcasts in history with their christmas eve program from lunar orbit which concluded with a reading from the biblical book of genesis238 two and a half hours after the broadcast they fired their engine to perform the first transearth injection to leave lunar orbit and return to the earth238 apollo 8 safely landed in the pacific ocean on december 27 in nasas first dawn splashdown and recovery238 the american lunar module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low earth orbit on apollo 9 in march 1969 the next mission apollo 10 conducted a dress rehearsal for the first landing in may 1969 flying the lm in lunar orbit as close as 47400 feet 144 km above the surface the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin239 with the lm proven to work well the next step was to attempt the landing unknown to the americans the soviet moon program was in deep trouble237 after two successive launch failures of the n1 rocket in 1969 soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered delay240 the launch pad explosion of the n1 on july 3 1969 was a significant setback241 the rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown destroying itself and the launch facility241 without the n1 rocket the ussr could not send a large enough payload to the moon to land a human and return him safely242 the latter period of the space race began with the united states landing the first men on the moon and was followed by the soviets operating the first space stations and putting the first robotic landers on venus and mars the us space shuttles marking the first significant reusable space vehicles and a cooling down of tensions with the first docking between a soviet and american vessel apollo 11 was prepared with the goal of a july landing in the sea of tranquility just half a year after the first crewed flight to the moon243 the crew selected in january 1969 consisted of commander cdr neil armstrong command module pilot cmp michael collins and lunar module pilot lmp edwin buzz aldrin244 they trained for the mission until just before the launch day245 on july 16 1969 at 932 am edt the saturn v rocket as506 lifted off from kennedy space center launch complex 39 in florida246 the trip to the moon took just over three days247 after achieving orbit armstrong and aldrin transferred into the lunar module named eagle leaving collins in the command and service module columbia and began their descent despite the interruption of alarms from an overloaded computer caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 meters 590 ft to correct a slight downrange guidance error and set the eagle down on a safe landing spot at 201804 utc july 20 1969 31704 pm cdt six hours later at 0256 utc july 21 956 pm cdt july 20 armstrong left the eagle to become the first human to set foot on the moon248 the first step was witnessed on live television by at least onefifth of the population of earth or about 723 million people249 his first words when he stepped off the lms landing footpad were thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind248 aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later250 altogether they spent just under two and onequarter hours outside their craft251 the next day they performed the first crewed launch from another celestial body and rendezvoused back with collins in columbia252 but before they return ascended the space race came to a particular culmination253 a few days before apollo 11 left earth the soviet union launched the luna 15 probe entering lunar orbit just before apollo 11 and eventually sharing it with apollo 11 aware of luna 15 apollo 8 astronaut frank borman was asked to use his goodwill contacts in the soviet union to prevent any collision subsequently in one of the first instances of sovietamerican space communication the soviet union released luna 15s flight plan to ensure it would not collide with apollo 11 although its exact mission was not publicized254 but as apollo 11 was wrapping up surface activities the soviet mission command hastened luna 15 and attempted its robotic samplereturn mission before apollo 11 would return as luna 15 descended just two hours before apollo 11s launch and impacted at 1550 utc some hundred kilometers away from apollo 11 british astronomers monitoring luna 15 recorded the situation with one commentingi say this has really been drama of the highest order255 apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to earth landing safely in the pacific ocean on july 24 1969256 when the spacecraft splashed down 2982 days had passed since kennedys commitment to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the decade the mission was completed with 161 days to spare257 with the safe completion of the apollo 11 mission the americans won the race to the moon258 armstrong and his crew became worldwide celebrities feted with tickertape parades on august 13 in new york city and chicago attended by an estimated six million259260 that evening in los angeles they were honored at an official state dinner attended by members of congress 44 governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from 83 nations the president and vice president presented each astronaut with the presidential medal of freedom259261 the astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on september 16 1969262 this began a 38day world tour to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries263 the publics reaction in the soviet union was mixed the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction a portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it264 the first landing was followed by another precision landing on apollo 12 in november 1969 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 spacecraft which landed on april 20 1967 in total the apollo programme involved six crewed moon landings from 1969 to 1972 and a total of twelve astronauts walked on the surface of the moon these were apollo 11 apollo 12 apollo 14 apollo 15 apollo 16 and apollo 17 nasa had ambitious followon human spaceflight plans as it reached its lunar goal but soon discovered it had expended most of its political capital to do so265 a victim of its own success apollo had achieved its first landing goal with enough spacecraft and saturn v launchers left for a total of ten lunar landings through apollo 20 conducting extendedduration missions and transporting the landing crews in lunar roving vehicles on the last five nasa also planned an apollo applications program aap to develop a longerduration earth orbital workshop later named skylab from a spent sivb upper stage to be constructed in orbit using several launches of the smaller saturn ib launch vehicle in february 1969 president richard m nixon convened a space task group to set recommendations for the future us civilian space program headed by his vice president spiro t agnew266 agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of nasas followup plans for permanent space stations in earth and lunar orbit perhaps a base on the lunar surface and the first human flight to mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000267 these would be serviced by an infrastructure of a reusable space transportation system including an earthtoorbit space shuttle nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in congress for new apollostyle programs which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing and he intended to pursue dtente with the ussr and china which he hoped might ease cold war tensions he cut the spending proposal he sent to congress to include funding for only the space shuttle with perhaps an option to pursue the earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future268 aap planners decided the earth orbital workshop could be accomplished more efficiently by prefabricating it on the ground and launching it with a single saturn v which immediately eliminated apollo 20 budget cuts soon led nasa to cut apollo 18 and 19 as well apollo 13 had to abort its lunar landing in april 1970 due to an inflight spacecraft failure but returned its crew safely to earth the apollo program made its final lunar landing in december 1972 the two unused saturn vs were used as outdoor visitor displays and allowed to deteriorate due to the effects of weathering the ussr continued trying to develop its n1 rocket after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972 finally canceling it in may 1974 without achieving a single successful uncrewed test flight269 in late 1970 luna 16 was launched by the soviet union and became the first uncrewed probe to return a sample from the moon this was followed by luna 20 and luna 24 in subsequent years270271 the soviet union was also able to successfully land the first robotic rover on the moon in 1970 followed by another in 1973 with the lunokhod missions272 these missions demonstrated continued soviet willingness to compete with the us in the space race despite having lost the manned moon landing aspect of the space race having lost the race to the moon the ussr seemed to decide to concentrate on orbital space stations instead of pursuing a crewed lunar mission during 1969 and 1970 they launched six more soyuz flights after soyuz 3 and then launched a series of six successful space stations plus two failures to achieve orbit and one station rendered uninhabitable due to damage from explosion of the launchers upper stage on their protonk heavylift launcher in their salyut program designed by kerim kerimov each one weighed between 18500 and 19824 kilograms 40786 and 43704 lb was 20 meters 66 ft long by 4 meters 13 ft in diameter and had a habitable volume of 99 cubic meters 3500 cu ft all of the salyuts were presented to the public as nonmilitary scientific laboratories but three of them were covers for military almaz reconnaissance stations salyut 2 failed273 salyut 3274 and salyut 5275276 salyut 1 the first space station was launched by the soviets on april 19 1971 three days later the soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station the soyuz 11 crew of vladislav volkov georgi dobrovolski and viktor patsayev successfully docked on june 7 and completed a then record 22day stay the crew became the second inflight space fatality during their reentry on june 30 when they were asphyxiated due to the spacecrafts cabin becoming depressurized shortly after undocking277278 the disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve that allowed the air to vent into space the crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred279 to prevent a recurrence of the soyuz 11 tragedy soviet engineers redesigned the soyuz spacecraft and mandated that cosmonauts wear sokol pressure suits during launch and landing a requirement still in place today280 the united states launched a single orbital workstation skylab on may 14 1973 it was launched using a leftover saturn5 rocket from the apollo programme280 skylab weighed 169950 pounds 77090 kg was 58 feet 18 m long by 217 feet 66 m in diameter and had a habitable volume of over 10000 cubic feet 280 m3 skylab was damaged during the ascent to orbit losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield subsequent crewed missions repaired the station and conducted valuable research the third and final missions crew skylab 4 set a human endurance record at the time with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on february 8 1974 skylab stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the earths atmosphere over the indian ocean and western australia on july 11 1979281 salyut 4 broke skylabs occupation record at 92 days salyut 6 and salyut 7 were secondgeneration stations designed for long duration and were occupied for 683 and 816 days salyut 7 improved upon earlier designs by allowing longduration crewed missions and more complex experiments these stations with their expanded crew capacity and amenities for long term stay carrying electric stoves a refrigerator and constant hot water282 in 1970 the soviet unions venera 7 marked the first time a spacecraft was able to return data after landing on another planet283 venera 7 held a resistant thermometer and an aneroid barometer to measure the temperature and atmospheric pressure on the surface the transmitted data showed 475 c at the surface and a pressure of 92 bar284285283286 in 1975 venera 9 established an orbit around venus and successfully returned the first photography of the surface of venus287288 venera 10 landed on venus and followed with further photography shortly after289 nasa initiated the pioneer venus project in 1978 successfully deploying four small probes into the venusian atmosphere on december 9 1978 the probes confirmed that venus has little if any magnetic field and cameras detected lightning in the atmosphere the last transmissions were received on october 8 1992 as its decaying orbit no longer permitted communications the spacecraft burned up the atmosphere soon after ending a successful 14year mission that was planned to last only eight months290 in 1981 venera 13 performed a successful softlanding on venus and marked the first probe to drill into the surface of another planet and take a sample291292 venera 13 also took an audio sample of the venusian environment marking another first293 venera 13 returned the first color images of the surface of venus revealing an orangebrown flat bedrock surface covered with loose regolith and small flat thin angular rocks291 venera 14 an identical spacecraft to venera 13 was launched 5 days apart with a similar mission profile294 in total ten venera probes achieved a soft landing on the surface of venus in 1984 the soviet vega programme began and ended with the launch of two crafts launched six days apart vega 1 and vega 2 both crafts deployed a balloon in addition to a lander marking a first in spaceflight295296297 the us never caught up or matched the soviet efforts to explore the surface of venus but did claim the title of the first successful probe to have flown by the planet and had notable success with the pioneer atmospheric probes in 1971 the soviets mars 2 successfully established mars orbit and attempted a soft landing but crashed becoming the first manmade object to impact mars this was shortly followed by mars 3 a 358 kg lander which successfully landed but the lander only transmitted data for 145 seconds before losing contact300 in 1976 nasa followed suit and put two successful landers on mars these were viking 1 and viking 2 these landers were significantly larger than the soviet mars landers viking 1 was 3527 kilograms they were able to take the first photographs from the surface of mars301302 viking 1 operated on the surface of mars for around six years on november 11 1982 the lander stopped operating after getting a faulty command and viking 2 for over three years mission ended in early 1980 both landers were equipped with a robotic sampler arm which successfully scooped up soil samples and tested them with instruments such as a gas chromatographymass spectrometer the landers measured temperatures ranging from negative 86 degrees celsius before dawn to negative 33 degrees celsius in the afternoon both landers had issues obtaining accurate results from their seismometers302303304305 photographs from the landers and orbiters surpassed expectations in quality and quantity the total exceeded 4500 from the landers and 52000 from the orbiters the viking landers recorded atmospheric pressures ranging from below 7 millibars 00068 bars to over 10 millibars 00108 bars over the martian year leading to the conclusion that atmospheric pressure varies by 30 percent during the martian year because carbon dioxide condenses and sublimes at the polar caps martian winds generally blow more slowly than expected scientists had expected them to reach speeds of several hundred miles an hour from observing global dust storms but neither lander recorded gusts over 120 kilometers 74 miles an hour and average velocities were considerably lower nevertheless the orbiters observed more than a dozen small dust storms the viking landers detected nitrogen in the atmosphere for the first time and that it was a significant component of the martian atmosphere there was speculation from the atmospheric analysis that the atmosphere of mars used to be much denser306307 the soviets did not match the martian lander achievements of nasa but did claim the title of the first lander308 in may 1972 president richard m nixon and soviet premier leonid brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as dtente creating a temporary thaw in the cold war the two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last us apollo craft with a soyuz known as the apollosoyuz test project astp to prepare the us designed a docking module for the apollo that was compatible with the soviet docking system which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other eg soyuztosoyuz as well as soyuztosalyut the module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each others craft which had incompatible cabin atmospheres the ussr used the soyuz 16 mission in december 1974 to test modifications of the soyuz atmosphere and the docking adapter to prepare for astp309310 the joint mission began when soyuz 19 was first launched on july 15 1975 at 1220 utc and the apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later the two craft rendezvoused and docked on july 17 at 1619 utc the three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts and the crew shook hands exchanged gifts and visited each others craft311 nasa achieved the first approach and landing test of its space shuttle orbiter on a boeing 747 carrier plane on august 12 1977 and the first orbital test flight of a complete crewed space shuttle consisting of the orbiter an external fuel tank and two solid rocket boosters on april 12 1981 the designers underestimated the time and cost of refurbishment between flights which reduced the cost benefit of its reusability they also overestimated its safety two of the fleet of five orbiters were lost in fatal flight accidents one during launch due to failure of a solid rocket booster seal and one on reentry due to launch damage of a wing heat shield the air force was also supposed to use the shuttle to launch its military payloads but shunned it in favor of its expendable launchers after the first shuttle loss nasa ceased production of its apollo spacecraft and saturn ib launcher and used the shuttle as its orbital workhorse until 2011 then retired it due to the safety concern originally more than 150 flights over a 15year operation were expected actually the shuttles made 135 flights in the 30year lifespan of the series312 the soviets interpreted the shuttle as a military surveillance vehicle and decided they had to develop their own shuttle which they named buran beginning in 1974 they copied the aerodynamic design of nasas shuttle orbiter which they strapped to the side of their expendable liquid hydrogenfueled energia launcher the buran could be fitted with four saturn al31 turbofan engines and a fuel tank in its payload bay allowing it to make its own atmospheric test flights which began in november 1985 also unlike the us shuttle it could be flown pilotlessly and landed automatically energiaburan made only one orbital test flight in november 1988 but us counterintelligence baited the soviets with disinformation about the heat shield design and it was not reusable for repeated flight313 buran was the largest and most expensive soviet program in the history of the space race314 and was effectively canceled by the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 due to lack of funding the energia was also canceled at the same time after only two flights the first woman in space was from the soviet union valentina tereshkova nasa did not welcome female astronauts into its corps until 1978 when six female mission specialists were recruited this first class included scientist sally ride who became americas first woman in space on sts7 in june 1983 nasa included women mission specialists in the next four astronaut candidate classes and admitted female pilots starting in 1990 eileen collins from this class became the first pilot to fly on space shuttle flight sts63 in february 1995 and the first female commander of a spaceflight on sts93 in july 1999 the ussr admitted its first female test pilot as a cosmonaut svetlana savitskaya in 1980 she became the first female to fly since tereshkova on salyut 7 in december 1981 the ussr turned its space program to the development of the low earth orbit modular space station mir peace or world assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996 at 129700 kilograms 285900 lb it held records for the largest spacecraft and the longest continuous human presence in space at 3644 days until the international space station was built starting in 1998315 mirs operation continued after the 1991 replacement of the ussrs space program with the russian federal space agency until 2001 supported by soyuz spacecraft the question of who won the space race has sparked considerable debate among historians and analysts the united states is widely seen as the victor due to the apollo crewed landing and moonwalk missions which achieved president john f kennedys ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth by the end of the 1960s this achievement completed in july 1969 marked the pinnacle of us space exploration efforts of the time and was regarded by most observers as the culmination of the space race political scientist richard j samuels describes apollo 11 as a decisive american victory15 the moon race is often analyzed as a microcosm of the space races broader dynamics historians such as jennifer frost argue that if the space race is measured in terms of overall spaceflight capability the soviet union won it hands down316 asif a siddiqi a noted space historian provides a more nuanced view emphasizing the soviet unions dominance in smaller aspects of the race to the moon yet critical benchmarks such as the first lunar impact first photos of the moons far side first soft lunar landing and first lunar orbit317 these accomplishments laid the groundwork for lunar exploration though they are often overshadowed by the apollo 11 mission before that landing apollo 11 there was an enormous amount of investment in the robotic exploration of the moon both by the soviets and the us in terms of all sorts of smaller benchmarks like the first lunar impact the first pictures of the far side of the moon the first soft lunar landing and the first lunar orbit we forget but in those little races the soviet union dominated almost every benchmark but it is forgotten as the united states won the big one the space race was deeply intertwined with cold war rivalries and reflected broader ideological contests between the united states and the soviet union historian walter mcdouglass highlights how space exploration served as a demonstration of each superpowers political and technological systems with the us emphasizing transparency and democratic values and the ussr showcasing the capabilities of its centralized statedriven model318319 asif a siddiqi stresses the importance of viewing the space race as more than a singleevent competition he notes that while the us achieved the symbolic big one with the apollo missions the soviet unions early and sustained achievements in robotic lunar and interplanetary exploration reveal the broader multifaceted nature of the rivalry317 after the end of the cold war in 1991 the assets of the ussrs space program passed mainly to russia since then the united states and russia have cooperated in space with the shuttlemir program and the international space station iss320 the russians continue to use their r7 rocket family as their orbital workhorse to launch the soyuz crewed spacecraft and its progress derivative uncrewed cargo craft as shuttles to the iss after the 2011 retirement of the space shuttle american crews were dependent on the r7soyuz to reach the iss321 until the 2020 first flight of the us crew dragon commercial crew development vehicle in 2023 the russian federation resumed the luna missions as a part of the lunaglob programme with the launch of luna 25 47 years after the soviet luna 24322 amidst american reignition of interest in the moon with the artemis program beginning with the launch of artemis i in 2022323
