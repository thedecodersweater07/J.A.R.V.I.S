sir isaac newtona 4 january os 25 december 1643 31 march os 20 march 1727b was an english polymath active as a mathematician physicist astronomer alchemist theologian and author5 newton was a key figure in the scientific revolution and the enlightenment that followed6 his book philosophi naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles of natural philosophy first published in 1687 achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics78 newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with german mathematician gottfried wilhelm leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus though he developed calculus years before leibniz newton contributed to and refined the scientific method and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science in the principia newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity he used his mathematical description of gravity to derive keplers laws of planetary motion account for tides the trajectories of comets the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena eradicating doubt about the solar systems heliocentricity9 newton solved the twobody problem and introduced the threebody problem he demonstrated that the motion of objects on earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles newtons inference that the earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of alexis clairaut charles marie de la condamine and others convincing most european scientists of the superiority of newtonian mechanics over earlier systems he was also the first to calculate the age of earth by experiment and described a precursor to the modern wind tunnel newton built the first reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum his work on light was collected in his book opticks published in 1704 he originated prisms as beam expanders and multipleprism arrays which would later become integral to the development of tunable lasers10 he also anticipated waveparticle duality and was the first to theorize the gooshnchen effect he further formulated an empirical law of cooling which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer11 made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound and introduced the notions of a newtonian fluid and a black body he was also the first to explain the magnus effect furthermore he made early studies into electricity in addition to his creation of calculus newtons work on mathematics was extensive he generalized the binomial theorem to any real number introduced the puiseux series was the first to state bzouts theorem classified most of the cubic plane curves contributed to the study of cremona transformations developed a method for approximating the roots of a function and also originated the newtoncotes formulas for numerical integration he further initiated the field of calculus of variations devised an early form of regression analysis and was a pioneer of vector analysis newton was a fellow of trinity college and the second lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge he was appointed at the age of 26 he was a devout but unorthodox christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the trinity he refused to take holy orders in the church of england unlike most members of the cambridge faculty of the day beyond his work on the mathematical sciences newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death politically and personally tied to the whig party newton served two brief terms as member of parliament for the university of cambridge in 16891690 and 17011702 he was knighted by queen anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in london serving as warden 16961699 and master 16991727 of the royal mint in which he increased the accuracy and security of british coinage as well as the president of the royal society 17031727 isaac newton was born according to the julian calendar in use in england at the time on christmas day 25 december 1642 ns 4 january 1643b at woolsthorpe manor in woolsthorpebycolsterworth a hamlet in the county of lincolnshire12 his father also named isaac newton had died three months before born prematurely newton was a small child his mother hannah ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug13 when newton was three his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband the reverend barnabas smith leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother margery ayscough ne blythe newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19 threatening my father and mother smith to burn them and the house over them14 newtons mother had three children mary benjamin and hannah from her second marriage15 from the age of about twelve until he was seventeen newton was educated at the kings school in grantham which taught latin and ancient greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics16 he was removed from school by his mother and returned to woolsthorpebycolsterworth by october 1659 his mother widowed for the second time attempted to make him a farmer an occupation he hated17 henry stokes master at the kings school and reverend william ayscough newtons uncle persuaded his mother to send him back to school18 motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully he became the topranked student19 distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills20 in june 1661 newton was admitted to trinity college at the university of cambridge his uncle the reverend william ayscough who had studied at cambridge recommended him to the university at cambridge newton started as a subsizar paying his way by performing valet duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664 which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his ma21 at the time cambridges teachings were based on those of aristotle whom newton read along with then more modern philosophers including ren descartes and astronomers such as galileo galilei and thomas street he set down in his notebook a series of quaestiones about mechanical philosophy as he found it in 1665 he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus soon after newton obtained his ba degree at cambridge in august 1665 the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the great plague22 although he had been undistinguished as a cambridge student his private studies and the years following his bachelors degree have been described as the richest and most productive ever experienced by a scientist23 the next two years alone saw the development of theories on calculus24 optics and the law of gravitation at his home in woolsthorpe the physicist louis trenchard more suggesting that there are no other examples of achievement in the history of science to compare with that of newton during those two golden years25 newton has been described as an exceptionally organized person when it came to notetaking further dogearing pages he saw as important furthermore newtons indexes look like presentday indexes they are alphabetical by topic his books showed his interests to be wideranging with newton himself described as a janusian thinker someone who could mix and combine seemingly disparate fields to stimulate creative breakthroughs26 in april 1667 newton returned to the university of cambridge and in october he was elected as a fellow of trinity2728 fellows were required to take holy orders and be ordained as anglican priests although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the church of england was sufficient he made the commitment that i will either set theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes 7 years arrives or i will resign from the college29 up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirtynine articles the basis of church of england doctrine by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and his unconventional views stood in the way30 his academic work impressed the lucasian professor isaac barrow who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential he became master of trinity college two years later in 1669 newton succeeded him only one year after receiving his ma newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement and king charles ii whose permission was needed accepted this argument thus a conflict between newtons religious views and anglican orthodoxy was averted31 he was appointed at the age of 2632 as accomplished as newton was as a theoretician he was less effective as a teacher as his classes were almost always empty humphrey newton his sizar assistant noted that newton would arrive on time and if the room was empty he would reduce his lecture time in half from 30 to 15 minutes talk to the walls then retreat to his experiments thus fulfilling his contractual obligations for his part newton enjoyed neither teaching nor students over his career he was only assigned three students to tutor and none were noteworthy33 newton was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 16721 the lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge position included the responsibility of instructing geography34 in 1672 and again in 1681 newton published a revised corrected and amended edition of the geographia generalis a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the thendeceased bernhardus vareniusbernhardus varenius geographia generalis ed isaac newton 2nd ed cambridge joann hayes 168135 36 in the geographia generalis varenius attempted to create a theoretical foundation linking scientific principles to classical concepts in geography and considered geography to be a mix between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying features of the earth3437 while it is unclear if newton ever lectured in geography the 1733 dugdale and shaw english translation of the book stated newton published the book to be read by students while he lectured on the subject34 the geographia generalis is viewed by some as the dividing line between ancient and modern traditions in the history of geography and newtons involvement in the subsequent editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for this enduring legacy38 newtons work has been said to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied39 his work on calculus usually referred to as fluxions began in 1664 and by 20 may 1665 as seen in a manuscript newton had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve40 another manuscript of october 1666 is now published among newtons mathematical papers41 his work de analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas sent by isaac barrow to john collins in june 1669 was identified by barrow in a letter sent to collins that august as the work of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things42 newton later became involved in a dispute with gottfried wilhelm leibniz over priority in the development of calculus both are now credited with independently developing calculus though with very different mathematical notations however it is established that newton came to develop calculus much earlier than leibniz434445 the notation of leibniz is recognized as the more convenient notation being adopted by continental european mathematicians and after 1820 by british mathematicians46 historian of science a rupert hall notes that while leibniz deserves credit for his independent formulation of calculus newton was undoubtedly the first to develop it stating47 but all these matters are of little weight in comparison with the central truth which has indeed long been universally recognized that newton was master of the essential techniques of the calculus by the end of 1666 almost exactly nine years before leibniz newtons claim to have mastered the new infinitesimal calculus long before leibniz and even to have written or at least made a good start upon a publishable exposition of it as early as 1671 is certainly borne out by copious evidence and though leibniz and some of his friends sought to belittle newtons case the truth has not been seriously in doubt for the last 250 years hall further notes that in principia newton was able to formulate and resolve problems by the integration of differential equations and in fact he anticipated in his book many results that later exponents of the calculus regarded as their own novel achievements48 hall notes newtons rapid development of calculus in comparison to his contemporaries stating that newton well before 1690 had reached roughly the point in the development of the calculus that leibniz the two bernoullis lhospital hermann and others had by joint efforts reached in print by the early 1700s49 despite the convenience of leibnizs notation it has been noted that newtons notation could also have developed multivariate techniques with his dot notation still widely used in physics some academics have noted the richness and depth of newtons work such as physicist roger penrose stating in most cases newtons geometrical methods are not only more concise and elegant they reveal deeper principles than would become evident by the use of those formal methods of calculus that nowadays would seem more direct mathematician vladimir arnold states comparing the texts of newton with the comments of his successors it is striking how newtons original presentation is more modern more understandable and richer in ideas than the translation due to commentators of his geometrical ideas into the formal language of the calculus of leibniz50 his work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities in the principia itself newton gave demonstration of this under the name of the method of first and last ratios51 and explained why he put his expositions in this form52 remarking also that hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles53 because of this the principia has been called a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus in modern times54 and in newtons time nearly all of it is of this calculus55 his use of methods involving one or more orders of the infinitesimally small is present in his de motu corporum in gyrum of 168456 and in his papers on motion during the two decades preceding 168457 newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism58 he was close to the swiss mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier in 1691 duillier started to write a new version of newtons principia and corresponded with leibniz59 in 1693 the relationship between duillier and newton deteriorated and the book was never completed60 starting in 1699 duillier accused leibniz of plagiarism61 mathematician john keill accused leibniz of plagiarism in 1708 in the royal society journal thereby deteriorating the situation even more62 the dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the royal society proclaimed in a study that it was newton who was the true discoverer and labelled leibniz a fraud it was later found that newton wrote the studys concluding remarks on leibniz thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both men until leibnizs death in 171663 newton is credited with the generalised binomial theorem valid for any exponent he discovered newtons identities newtons method classified cubic plane curves polynomials of degree three in two variables is a founder of the theory of cremona transformations64 made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences with newton regarded as the single most significant contributor to finite difference interpolation with many formulas created by newton65 he was the first to state bzouts theorem and was also the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to diophantine equations he approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms a precursor to eulers summation formula and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series he introduced the puisseux series66 he originated the newtoncotes formulas for numerical integration67 newtons work on infinite series was inspired by simon stevins decimals68 he also initiated the field of calculus of variations being the first to clearly formulate and correctly solve a problem in the field that being newtons minimal resistance problem which he posed and solved in 1685 and then later published in principia in 168769 it is regarded as one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century70 he then used calculus of variations in his solving of the brachistochrone curve problem in 1697 which was posed by johann bernoulli in 1696 thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems71 he was also a pioneer of vector analysis as he demonstrated how to apply the parallelogram law for adding various physical quantities and realized that these quantities could be broken down into components in any direction72 in 1666 newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong even when the light ray entering the prism is circular which is to say the prism refracts different colours by different angles7475 this led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light a point which had until then been a matter of debate from 1670 to 1672 newton lectured on optics76 during this period he investigated the refraction of light demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism which he named a spectrum could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism77 modern scholarship has revealed that newtons analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy78 in his work on newtons rings in 1671 he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century as he averaged all of the differences and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring in effect introducing a now standard method for reducing noise in measurements and which does not appear elsewhere at the time79 he extended his errorslaying method to studies of equinoxes in 1700 which was described as an altogether unprecedented method but differed in that here newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times and so he devised a method that allowed them to as it were selfcorrect80 newton wrote down the first of the two normal equations known from ordinary least squares and devised an early form of regression analysis as he averaged a set of data 50 years before tobias mayer and also summing the residuals to zero he forced the regression line to pass through the average point newton also differentiated between two uneven sets of data and may have considered an optimal solution regarding bias although not in terms of effectiveness81 he showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects and that regardless of whether reflected scattered or transmitted the light remains the same colour thus he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with alreadycoloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves this is known as newtons theory of colour82 his 1672 paper on the nature of white light and colours forms the basis for all work that followed on colour and colour vision83 from this work he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours chromatic aberration as a proof of the concept he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem building the design the first known functional reflecting telescope today known as a newtonian telescope involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique84 he grounded his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal using newtons rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes in late 166885 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope it was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image in 1671 he was asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope by the royal society86 their interest encouraged him to publish his notes of colours87 which he later expanded into the work opticks when robert hooke criticised some of newtons ideas newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate however the two had brief exchanges in 167980 when hooke who had been appointed secretary of the royal society88 opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from newton to royal society transactions89 which had the effect of stimulating newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector90 newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium he verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films opticks bk ii props 12 but still retained his theory of fits that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted props13 physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction despite his known preference of a particle theory newton in fact noted that light had both particlelike and wavelike properties in opticks and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories thereby anticipating later developments of waveparticle duality which is the modern understanding of light9192 physicist david finkelstein called him the first quantum physicist as a result91 in his hypothesis of light of 1675 newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles the contact with the cambridge platonist philosopher henry more revived his interest in alchemy93 he replaced the ether with occult forces based on hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles his contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy93 this was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science9495 in 1704 newton published opticks in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light and included a set of queries at the end which were posed as unanswered questions and positive assertions in line with his corpuscle theory he thought that normal matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation with query 30 stating are not gross bodies and light convertible into one another and may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition96 query 6 introduced the concept of a black body9798 newton also made early studies into electricity as he constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator using a glass globe99 the first to do so with glass instead of sulfur which had previously been used by scientists such as otto von guericke to construct their globes100 he detailed an experiment in 1675 that showed when one side of a glass sheet is rubbed to create an electric charge it attracts light bodies to the opposite side he interpreted this as evidence that electric forces could pass through glass101 his idea in opticks that optical reflection and refraction arise from interactions across the entire surface is regarded as the beginning of the field theory of electric force102 he recognized the crucial role of electricity in nature believing it to be responsible for various phenomena including the emission reflection refraction inflection and heating effects of light he proposed that electricity was involved in the sensations experienced by the human body affecting everything from muscle movement to brain function103 his massdispersion model ancestral to the successful use of the least action principle provided a credible framework for understanding refraction particularly in its approach to refraction in terms of momentum102 in opticks he was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander and also the use of multipleprism arrays some 278 years after newtons discussion multipleprism beam expanders became central to the development of narrowlinewidth tunable lasers the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multipleprism dispersion theory10 newton was also the first to propose the gooshnchen effect an optical phenomenon in which linearly polarized light undergoes a small lateral shift when totally internally reflected he provided both experimental and theoretical explanations for the effect using a mechanical model104 science came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics the german poet and scientist johann wolfgang von goethe could not shake the newtonian foundation but one hole goethe did find in newtons armour newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible he therefore thought that the objectglasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect achromatism and refraction being incompatible this inference was proved by dollond to be wrong105 newton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665106 in 1679 he returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to keplers laws of planetary motion newtons reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 16801681 on which he corresponded with john flamsteed107 after the exchanges with hooke newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector he shared his results with edmond halley and the royal society in de motu corporum in gyrum a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the royal societys register book in december 1684108 this tract contained the nucleus that newton developed and expanded to form the principia the principia was published on 5 july 1687 with encouragement and financial help from halley in this work newton stated the three universal laws of motion together these laws describe the relationship between any object the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion laying the foundation for classical mechanics they contributed to numerous advances during the industrial revolution and were not improved upon for more than 200 years many of these advances still underpin nonrelativistic technologies today newton used the latin word gravitas weight for the effect that would become known as gravity and defined the law of universal gravitation109 his work achieved the first great unification in physics8 he solved the twobody problem and introduced the threebody problem110 in the same work newton presented a calculuslike method of geometrical analysis using first and last ratios gave the first analytical determination based on boyles law of the speed of sound in air inferred the oblateness of earths spheroidal figure accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the moons gravitational attraction on the earths oblateness initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets and much more109 newtons biographer david brewster reported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected newtons health he was deprived of his appetite and sleep during his work on the problem in 169293 and told the astronomer john machin that his head never ached but when he was studying the subject according to brewster halley also told john conduitt that when pressed to complete his analysis newton always replied that it made his head ache and kept him awake so often that he would think of it no more emphasis in original111 he provided the first calculation of the age of earth by experiment112113 and also described a precursor to the modern wind tunnel114 newton made clear his heliocentric view of the solar systemdeveloped in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid1680s he recognised the deviation of the sun from the centre of gravity of the solar system115 for newton it was not precisely the centre of the sun or any other body that could be considered at rest but rather the common centre of gravity of the earth the sun and all the planets is to be esteemd the centre of the world and this centre of gravity either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line newton adopted the at rest alternative in view of common consent that the centre wherever it was was at rest116 newton was criticised for introducing occult agencies into science because of his postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances117 later in the second edition of the principia 1713 newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding general scholium writing that it was enough that the phenomenon implied a gravitational attraction as they did but they did not so far indicate its cause and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomenon here he used what became his famous expression hypotheses non fingo118 with the principia newton became internationally recognised119 he acquired a circle of admirers including the swissborn mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier120 in the 1660s and 1670s newton found 72 of the 78 species of cubic curves and categorised them into four types systemizing his results in later publications however a 1690s manuscript later analyzed showed that newton had identified all 78 cubic curves but chose not to publish the remaining six for unknown reasons6467 in 1717 and probably with newtons help james stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types he claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them and this was proved in 1731 four years after his death121 newton studied heat and energy flow formulating an empirical law of cooling which states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surrounding environment it was first formulated in 1701 and is the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer11 newton introduced the notion of a newtonian fluid with his formulation of his law of viscosity in principia in 1687 it states that the shear stress between two fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient between them122 he also discussed the circular motion of fluids and was the first to discuss couette flow123124 newton was the first to observe and qualitatively describe what would much later be formalized as the magnus effect nearly two centuries before heinrich magnuss experimental studies in a 1672 text newton recounted watching tennis players at cambridge college and noted how a tennis ball struck obliquely with a spinning motion curved in flight he explained that the balls combination of circular and progressive motion caused one side to press and beat the contiguous air more violently than the other thereby producing a reluctancy and reaction of the air proportionably greater an astute observation of the pressure differential responsible for lateral deflection125126 newtons role as a philosopher was deeply influential and understanding the philosophical landscape of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries requires recognizing his central contributions historically newton was widely regarded as a core figure in modern philosophy for example johann jacob bruckers historia critica philosophiae 1744 considered the first comprehensive modern history of philosophy prominently positioned newton as a central philosophical figure this portrayal notably shaped the perception of modern philosophy among leading enlightenment intellectuals including figures such as diderot dalembert and kant127 starting with the second edition of his principia newton included a final section on science philosophy or method it was here that he wrote his famous line in latin hypotheses non fingo which can be translated as i dont make hypotheses the direct translation of fingo is frame but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science newtons rejection of hypotheses hypotheses non fingo emphasizes that he refused to speculate on causes not directly supported by phenomena harper explains that newtons experimental philosophy involves clearly distinguishing hypothesesunverified conjecturesfrom propositions established through phenomena and generalized by induction according to newton true scientific inquiry requires grounding explanations strictly on observable data rather than speculative reasoning thus for newton proposing hypotheses without empirical backing undermines the integrity of experimental philosophy as hypotheses should serve merely as tentative suggestions subordinate to observational evidence128 in latin he wrote rationem vero harum gravitatis proprietatum ex phaenomenis nondum potui deducere hypotheses non fingo quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est hypotheses seu metaphysicae seu physicae seu qualitatum occultarum seu mechanicae in philosophia experimentali locum non habent in hac philosophia propositiones deducuntur ex phaenomenis et redduntur generales per inductionem129 this is translated as hitherto i have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena and i frame no hypotheses for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis and hypotheses whether metaphysical or physical whether of occult qualities or mechanical have no place in experimental philosophy in this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction53 newton contributed to and refined the scientific method in his work on the properties of light in the 1670s he showed his rigorous method which was conducting experiments taking detailed notes making measurements conducting more experiments that grew out of the initial ones he formulated a theory created more experiments to test it and finally described the entire process so other scientists could replicate every step130 in his 1687 principia he outlined four rules the first is admit no more causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances the second is to the same natural effect assign the same causes the third is qualities of bodies which are found to belong to all bodies within experiments are to be esteemed universal and lastly propositions collected from observation of phenomena should be viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena these rules have become the basis of the modern approaches to science131 in the 1690s newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the bible a manuscript newton sent to john locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 john 57the johannine commaand its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the new testament remained unpublished until 1785132 newton was also a member of the parliament of england for cambridge university in 1689 and 1701 but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed133 he was however noted by cambridge diarist abraham de la pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted134 newton moved to london to take up the post of warden of the royal mint during the reign of king william iii in 1696 a position that he had obtained through the patronage of charles montagu 1st earl of halifax then chancellor of the exchequer he took charge of englands great recoining trod on the toes of lord lucas governor of the tower and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary chester branch for edmond halley newton became perhaps the bestknown master of the mint upon the death of thomas neale in 1699 a position he held for the last 30 years of his life135136 these appointments were intended as sinecures but newton took them seriously he retired from his cambridge duties in 1701 and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters as warden and afterwards as master of the royal mint newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the great recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit counterfeiting was high treason punishable by the felon being hanged drawn and quartered despite this convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult but newton proved equal to the task137 disguised as a habitu of bars and taverns he gathered much of that evidence himself138 for all the barriers placed to prosecution and separating the branches of government english law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority newton had himself made a justice of the peace in all the home counties a draft letter regarding the matter is included in newtons personal first edition of philosophi naturalis principia mathematica which he must have been amending at the time139 then he conducted more than 100 crossexaminations of witnesses informers and suspects between june 1698 and christmas 1699 he successfully prosecuted 28 coiners including serial counterfeiter william chaloner who was subsequently hanged140 beyond prosecuting counterfeiters he improved minting technology and reduced the standard deviation of the weight of guineas from 13 grams to 075 grams starting in 1707 newton introduced the practice of testing a small sample of coins a pound in weight in the trial of the pyx which helped to reduce the size of admissible error he ultimately saved the treasury a then 41510 roughly 3 million in 2012141 with his improvements lasting until the 1770s thereby increasing the accuracy of british coinage142 newtons activities at the mint influenced rising scientific and commercial interests in fields such as numismatics geology mining metallurgy and metrology in the early 18th century143 newton was made president of the royal society in 1703 and an associate of the french acadmie des sciences in his position at the royal society newton made an enemy of john flamsteed the astronomer royal by prematurely publishing flamsteeds historia coelestis britannica which newton had used in his studies145 in april 1705 queen anne knighted newton during a royal visit to trinity college cambridge the knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in may 1705 rather than any recognition of newtons scientific work or services as master of the mint146 newton was the second scientist to be knighted after francis bacon147 as a result of a report written by newton on 21 september 1717 to the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 december 1717 forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings148 this inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports while exports were paid for in gold effectively moving britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard it is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not149 it has been argued that newton viewed his work at the mint as a continuation of his alchemical work150 newton was invested in the south sea company and lost at least 10000 and plausibly more than 20000 44 million in 2020151 when it collapsed in around 1720 since he was already rich before the bubble he still died rich at estate value around 30000152 toward the end of his life newton spent some time at cranbury park near winchester the country residence of his niece and her husband though he primarily lived in london153154 his halfniece catherine barton155 served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on jermyn street in london in a surviving letter written in 1700 while she was recovering from smallpox newton closed with the phrase your very loving uncle expressing familial concern in a manner typical of seventeenthcentury epistolary style156 historian patricia fara notes that the letters tone is warm and paternal including medical advice and attention to her appearance during convalescence rather than conveying any romantic implication157 newton died in his sleep in london on 20 march 1727 ns 31 march 1727b he was given a ceremonial funeral attended by nobles scientists and philosophers and was buried in westminster abbey among kings and queens he was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey158 voltaire may have been present at his funeral159 a bachelor he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years and died intestate160 his papers went to john conduitt and catherine barton161 shortly after his death a plaster death mask was moulded of newton it was used by flemish sculptor john michael rysbrack in making a sculpture of newton162 it is now held by the royal society163 newtons hair was posthumously examined and found to contain mercury probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits mercury poisoning could explain newtons eccentricity in late life160 although it was claimed that he was once engagedc newton never married the french writer and philosopher voltaire who was in london at the time of newtons funeral said that he was never sensible to any passion was not subject to the common frailties of mankind nor had any commerce with womena circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments165 newton had a close friendship with the swiss mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier whom he met in london around 1689120 some of their correspondence has survived166167 their relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693 and at the same time newton suffered a nervous breakdown168 which included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends samuel pepys and john locke his note to the latter included the charge that locke had endeavoured to embroil him with woemen by other means169 newton appeared to be relatively modest about his achievements writing in a later memoir i do not know what i may appear to the world but to myself i seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me170 nonetheless he could be fiercely competitive and did on occasion hold grudges against his intellectual rivals not abstaining from personal attacks when it suited hima common trait found in many of his contemporaries171 in a letter to robert hooke in february 1675 for instance he confessed if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants172 some historians argued that this written at a time when newton and hooke were disputing over optical discoveries was an oblique attack on hooke who was presumably short and hunchbacked rather than or in addition to a statement of modesty173 on the other hand the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants found in 17th century poet george herberts jacula prudentum 1651 among others had as its main point that a dwarf on a giants shoulders sees farther of the two and so in effect place newton himself rather than hooke as the dwarf who saw farther174 although born into an anglican family by his thirties newton had developed unorthodox beliefs175 with historian stephen snobelen labelling him a heretic176 by 1672 he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972177 over half of what newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy and most has never been printed177 his writings show extensive knowledge of early church texts and reveal that he sided with arius who rejected the conventional view of the trinity and was the losing party in the conflict with athanasius over the creed newton recognized christ as a divine mediator between god and man who was subordinate to the father who created him178 he was especially interested in prophecy but for him the great apostasy was trinitarianism179 newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement at the last moment in 1675 he received a government dispensation that excused him and all future holders of the lucasian chair180 worshipping jesus christ as god was in newtons eyes idolatry an act he believed to be the fundamental sin181 in 1999 snobelen wrote that isaac newton was a heretic but he never made a public declaration of his private faithwhich the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical he hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs snobelen concludes that newton was at least a socinian sympathiser he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight socinian books possibly an arian and almost certainly an antitrinitarian176 although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became newtons bestknown discoveries he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine as if akin to a great clock he said so then gravity may put the planets into motion but without the divine power it could never put them into such a circulating motion as they have about the sun183 along with his scientific fame newtons studies of the bible and of the early church fathers were also noteworthy newton wrote works on textual criticism most notably an historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture and observations upon the prophecies of daniel and the apocalypse of st john184 he placed the crucifixion of jesus christ at 3 april ad 33 which agrees with one traditionally accepted date185 he believed in a rationally immanent world but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in gottfried wilhelm leibniz and baruch spinoza the ordered and dynamically informed universe could be understood and must be understood by an active reason in his correspondence he claimed that in writing the principia i had an eye upon such principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a deity186 he saw evidence of design in the system of the world such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice but newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system due to the slow growth of instabilities187 for this leibniz lampooned him god almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time otherwise it would cease to move he had not it seems sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion188 newtons position was defended by his follower samuel clarke in a famous correspondence a century later pierresimon laplaces work celestial mechanics had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention189 the contrast between laplaces mechanistic worldview and newtons one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the french scientist gave napoleon who had criticised him for the absence of the creator in the mcanique cleste sire jai pu me passer de cette hypothse sir i can do without this hypothesis190 scholars long debated whether newton disputed the doctrine of the trinity his first biographer david brewster who compiled his manuscripts interpreted newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the trinity but never denying the doctrine of the trinity as such191 in the twentieth century encrypted manuscripts written by newton and bought by john maynard keynes among others were deciphered192 and it became known that newton did indeed reject trinitarianism176 newton and robert boyles approach to mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to pantheism and enthusiasm it was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians193 the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism194 and at the same time the second wave of english deists used newtons discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a natural religion the attacks made against preenlightenment magical thinking and the mystical elements of christianity were given their foundation with boyles mechanical conception of the universe newton gave boyles ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and perhaps more importantly was very successful in popularising them195 newton was not the first of the age of reason he was the last of the magicians the last of the babylonians and sumerians the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10000 years ago isaac newton a posthumous child born with no father on christmas day 1642 was the last wonderchild to whom the magi could do sincere and appropriate homage of an estimated ten million words of writing in newtons papers about one million deal with alchemy many of newtons writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts with his own annotations161 alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation often hidden behind layers of wordplay allegory and imagery to protect craft secrets197 some of the content contained in newtons papers could have been considered heretical by the church161 in 1888 after spending sixteen years cataloguing newtons papers cambridge university kept a small number and returned the rest to the earl of portsmouth in 1936 a descendant offered the papers for sale at sothebys198 the collection was broken up and sold for a total of about 9000199 john maynard keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of newtons collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to cambridge university in 1946198 all of newtons known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by indiana university the chymistry of isaac newton200 and has been summarised in a book201 newtons fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors and the formulation of the calculus yet there is another more mysterious side to newton that is imperfectly known a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues we refer to newtons involvement in the discipline of alchemy or as it was often called in seventeenthcentury england chymistry200 in june 2020 two unpublished pages of newtons notes on jan baptist van helmonts book on plague de peste were being auctioned online by bonhams newtons analysis of this book which he made in cambridge while protecting himself from londons 16651666 infection is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague according to bonhams as far as the therapy is concerned newton writes that the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it on to a dish of yellow wax and shortly after died combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison202 the mathematician and astronomer josephlouis lagrange frequently asserted that newton was the greatest genius who ever lived203 and once added that newton was also the most fortunate for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish204 english poet alexander pope wrote the famous epitaph nature and natures laws lay hid in night god said let newton be and all was light but this was not allowed to be inscribed in newtons monument at westminster the epitaph added is as follows205 h s e isaacus newton eques auratus qui animi vi prope divin planetarum motus figuras cometarum semitas oceanique aestus su mathesi facem praeferente primus demonstravit radiorum lucis dissimilitudines colorumque inde nascentium proprietates quas nemo

gratulentur mortales tale tantumque exstitisse humani generis decus nat xxv dec ad mdcxlii obiit xx mar mdccxxvi which can be translated as follows205 here is buried isaac newton knight who by a strength of mind almost divine and mathematical principles peculiarly his own explored the course and figures of the planets the paths of comets the tides of the sea the dissimilarities in rays of light and what no other scholar has previously imagined the properties of the colours thus produced diligent sagacious and faithful in his expositions of nature antiquity and the holy scriptures he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of god mighty and good and expressed the simplicity of the gospel in his manners mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race he was born on 25th december 1642 and died on 20th march 1726 newton has been called the most influential figure in the history of western science206 and has been regarded as the central figure in the history of science who more than anyone else is the source of our great confidence in the power of science207 new scientist called newton the supreme genius and most enigmatic character in the history of science208 the philosopher and historian david hume also declared that newton was the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species209 in his home of monticello thomas jefferson a founding father and president of the united states kept portraits of john locke sir francis bacon and newton whom he described as the three greatest men that have ever lived without any exception and who he credited with laying the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the physical and moral sciences210 the writer and philosopher voltaire wrote of newton that if all the geniuses of the universe were assembled newton should lead the band211 newton has further been called the towering figure of the scientific revolution and that in a period rich with outstanding thinkers newton was simply the most outstanding the polymath johann wolfgang von goethe labeled newtons birth as the christmas of the modern age6 in the italian polymath vilfredo paretos estimation newton was the greatest human being who ever lived212 on the bicentennial of newtons death in 1927 astronomer james jeans stated that he was certainly the greatest man of science and perhaps the greatest intellect the human race has seen211 physicist peter rowlands also notes that newton was possibly possessed of the most powerful intellect in the whole of human history171 newton ultimately conceived four revolutionsin optics mathematics mechanics and gravitybut also foresaw a fifth in electricity though he lacked the time and energy in old age to fully accomplish it213214 newtons work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science215216217 the physicist ludwig boltzmann called newtons principia the first and greatest work ever written about theoretical physics218 physicist stephen hawking similarly called principia probably the most important single work ever published in the physical sciences219 lagrange called principia the greatest production of the human mind and noted that he felt dazed at such an illustration of what mans intellect might be capable220 physicist edward andrade stated that newton was capable of greater sustained mental effort than any man before or since and noted earlier the place of isaac newton in history stating221 from time to time in the history of mankind a man arises who is of universal significance whose work changes the current of human thought or of human experience so that all that comes after him bears evidence of his spirit such a man was shakespeare such a man was beethoven such a man was newton and of the three his kingdom is the most widespread the french physicist and mathematician jeanbaptiste biot praised newtons genius stating that222 never was the supremacy of intellect so justly established and so fully confessed in mathematical and in experimental science without an equal and without an example combining the genius for both in its highest degree despite his rivalry with gottfried wilhem leibniz leibniz still praised the work of newton with him responding to a question at a dinner in 1701 from sophia charlotte the queen of prussia about his view of newton with223224 taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time of when newton lived what he had done was much the better half mathematician et bell ranked newton alongside carl friedrich gauss and archimedes as the three greatest mathematicians of all time225 with the mathematician donald m davis also noting that newton is generally ranked with the other two as the greatest mathematicians ever226 in the cambridge companion to isaac newton 2016 he is described as being from a very young age an extraordinary problemsolver as good it would appear as humanity has ever produced227 he is ultimately ranked among the top two or three greatest theoretical scientists ever alongside james clerk maxwell and albert einstein the greatest mathematician ever alongside carl f gauss and among the best experimentalists ever thereby putting newton in a class by himself among empirical scientists for one has trouble in thinking of any other candidate who was in the first rank of even two of these categories also noted is at least in comparison to subsequent scientists newton was also exceptional in his ability to put his scientific effort in much wider perspective228 gauss himself had archimedes and newton as his heroes229 and used terms such as clarissimus or magnus to describe other intellectuals such as great mathematicians and philosophers but reserved summus for newton only and once realizing the immense influence of newtons work on scientists such as lagrange and pierresimon laplace gauss then exclaimed that newton remains forever the master of all masters220230 in his book great physicists chemist william h cropper highlighted the unparalleled genius of newton stating231 on one assessment there should be no doubt newton was the greatest creative genius physics has ever seen none of the other candidates for the superlative einstein maxwell boltzmann gibbs and feynman has matched newtons combined achievements as theoretician experimentalist and mathematician albert einstein kept a picture of newton on his study wall alongside ones of michael faraday and of james clerk maxwell232 einstein stated that newtons creation of calculus in relation to his laws of motion was perhaps the greatest advance in thought that a single individual was ever privileged to make233 he also noted the influence of newton stating that234 the whole evolution of our ideas about the processes of nature with which we have been concerned so far might be regarded as an organic development of newtons ideas in 1999 an opinion poll of 100 of the days leading physicists voted einstein the greatest physicist ever with newton the runnerup while a parallel survey of rankandfile physicists ranked newton as the greatest235236 in 2005 a dual survey of the public and members of britains royal society asked two questions who made the bigger overall contributions to science and who made the bigger positive contributions to humankind with the candidates being newton or einstein in both groups and for both questions the consensus was that newton had made the greater overall contributions237238 in 1999 time named newton the person of the century for the 17th century213 newton placed sixth in the 100 greatest britons poll conducted by bbc in 2002 however in 2003 he was voted as the greatest briton in a poll conducted by bbc world with winston churchill second239 he was voted as the greatest cantabrigian by university of cambridge students in 2009240 physicist lev landau ranked physicists on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius ranging from 0 to 5 the highest ranking 0 was assigned to newton einstein was ranked 05 a rank of 1 was awarded to the fathers of quantum mechanics such as werner heisenberg and paul dirac landau a nobel prize winner and the discoverer of superfluidity ranked himself as 2241242 the si derived unit of force is named the newton in his honour most of newtons surviving scientific and technical papers are kept at cambridge university cambridge university library has the largest collection and there are also papers in kings college trinity college and the fitzwilliam museum there is an archive of theological and alchemical papers in the national library of israel and smaller collections at the smithsonian institution stanford university library and the huntington library the royal society in london also has some manuscripts243 the israel collection was inscribed by unesco on its memory of the world international register in 2015 recognising the global significance of the documents the cambridge and royal society collections were added to this inscription in 2017244 newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree245246 the story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by catherine barton newtons niece to voltaire247 voltaire then wrote in his essay on epic poetry 1727 sir isaac newton walking in his gardens had the first thought of his system of gravitation upon seeing an apple falling from a tree248249 although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any single moment250 acquaintances of newton such as william stukeley whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the royal society do in fact confirm the incident though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit newtons head stukeley recorded in his memoirs of sir isaac newtons life a conversation with newton in kensington on 15 april 1726251252 we went into the garden drank thea under the shade of some appletrees only he myself amidst other discourse he told me he was just in the same situation as when formerly the notion of gravitation came into his mind why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground thought he to him self occasiond by the fall of an apple as he sat in a comtemplative mood why should it not go sideways or upwards but constantly to the earths centre assuredly the reason is that the earth draws it there must be a drawing power in matter the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center not in any side of the earth therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly or toward the center if matter thus draws matter it must be in proportion of its quantity therefore the apple draws the earth as well as the earth draws the apple john conduitt newtons assistant at the royal mint and husband of newtons niece also described the event when he wrote about newtons life253 in the year 1666 he retired again from cambridge to his mother in lincolnshire whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity which brought an apple from a tree to the ground was not limited to a certain distance from earth but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought why not as high as the moon said he to himself if so that must influence her motion perhaps retain her in her orbit whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition it is known from his notebooks that newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends in an inversesquare proportion to the moon however it took him two decades to develop the fullfledged theory254 the question was not whether gravity existed but whether it extended far enough to hold the moon in orbit newton demonstrated that if the force decreased with the inverse square of the distance one could calculate the moons orbital period with good accuracy he guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions and hence named it universal gravitation various trees are claimed to be the apple tree described by newton for one the kings school grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school and transplated to the headmasters garden years later on the other hand the staff at woolsthorpe manor now owned by the national trust contend that the tree in their garden is the true one referenced by newton a descendant of the original tree255 can be seen growing outside the main gate of trinity college cambridge below the room newton lived in when he studied there the national fruit collection at brogdale in kent256 can supply grafts from their tree which appears identical to flower of kent a coarsefleshed cooking variety257 newtons monument 1731 can be seen in westminster abbey at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen near his tomb it was executed by the sculptor michael rysbrack 16941770 in white and grey marble with design by the architect william kent258 the monument features a figure of newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680 a relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism259 from 1978 until 1988 an image of newton designed by harry ecclestone appeared on series d 1 banknotes issued by the bank of england the last 1 notes to be issued by the bank of england newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope a prism and a map of the solar system260 a statue of isaac newton looking at an apple at his feet can be seen at the oxford university museum of natural history a large bronze statue newton after william blake by eduardo paolozzi dated 1995 and inspired by blakes etching dominates the piazza of the british library in london a bronze statue of newton was erected in 1858 in the centre of grantham where he went to school prominently standing in front of grantham guildhall the stillsurviving farmhouse at woolsthorpe by colsterworth is a grade i listed building by historic england through being his birthplace and where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light261 the institute of physics or iop has its highest and most prestigious award the isaac newton medal named after newton which is given for worldleading contributions to physics262263 it was first awarded in 2008 it is held by european philosophers of the enlightenment and by historians of the enlightenment that newtons publication of the principia was a turning point in the scientific revolution and started the enlightenment it was newtons conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for enlightenment ideology264 john locke and voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights the physiocrats and adam smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and selfinterest to economic systems and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progresscitation needed james burnett lord monboddo and samuel clarke resisted elements of newtons work but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature265
