an encyclopediaa is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special in a particular field or discipline12 encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name3 or by thematic categories or else are hyperlinked and searchable4 encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries35 generally speaking encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the articles title5 this is unlike dictionary entries which focus on linguistic information about words such as their etymology meaning pronunciation use and grammatical forms56789 encyclopedias have existed for around 2000 years10 and have evolved considerably during that time as regards language written in a major international or a vernacular language size few or many volumes intent presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge cultural perspective authoritative ideological didactic utilitarian authorship qualifications style readership education level background interests capabilities and the technologies available for their production and distribution handwritten manuscripts small or large print runs internet as a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts printed versions found a prominent place in libraries schools and other educational institutions11 in the 21st century the appearance of digital and opensource versions such as wikipedia together with the wiki website format has vastly expanded the accessibility authorship readership and variety of encyclopedia entries12 the word encyclopedia comes from the koine greek 13 transliterated enkklios paidea general education from enkklios circular recurrent required regularly general514 and paidea education rearing of a child together the phrase literally translates as complete instruction complete knowledge15 however the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error16 by copyists of a latin manuscript edition of quintillian in 147017 the copyists took this phrase to be a single greek word enkuklopaidea with the same meaning and this spurious greek word became the neolatin word encyclopaedia which was in turn borrowed into english because of this compounded word readers since the fifteenth century have often and incorrectly thought that the roman authors quintillian and pliny described an ancient genre18 following noah websters spelling reform19 the spelling of the word varies between encyclopedia in american english encyclopaedia in british english although the spelling encyclopedia is increasingly gaining acceptance and encyclopdia in certain specialized cases20 the modern encyclopedia evolved from the dictionary in the 18th century this lineage can be seen in the alphabetical order of print encyclopedias21 historically both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been compiled by welleducated authors but they are significantly different in structure a dictionary is a linguistic work that primarily focuses on an alphabetical listing of words and their definitions synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary giving no obvious place for indepth treatment thus a dictionary typically provides limited information analysis or background for the word defined2223 while it may offer a definition it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning significance or limitations of a term and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge24 to address those needs an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions and is not limited to defining an individual word but provides a more extensive meaning for a subject or discipline the merriamwebster definition of encyclopedia states that it is a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject25 in addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic the article can treat the topics more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject an encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations as well as bibliography and statistics5 in addition sometimes books or reading lists are compiled from a compendium of articles either wholly or partially taken from a specific encyclopedia26 four major elements define an encyclopedia its subject matter its scope its method of organization and its method of production some works entitled dictionaries are similar to encyclopedias especially those concerned with a particular field such as the dictionary of the middle ages the dictionary of american naval fighting ships and blacks law dictionary the macquarie dictionary australias national dictionary became an encyclopedic dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication and the words derived from such proper nouns there are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries most noticeably encyclopedia articles are longer fuller and more thorough than entries in most generalpurpose dictionaries331 there are differences in content as well generally speaking dictionaries provide linguistic information about words themselves while encyclopedias focus more on the things for which those words stand6789 thus while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name as such dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages but encyclopedia articles can be6 in practice however the distinction is not concrete as there is no clearcut difference between factual encyclopedic information and linguistic information such as appear in dictionaries83132 thus encyclopedias may contain material that is also found in dictionaries and vice versa32 in particular dictionary entries often contain factual information about the thing named by the word3132 the earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the natural history of pliny the elder a roman statesman living in the 1st century ad5333435 a work indebted to varro 1st century bce36 he compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history architecture medicine geography geology and all aspects of the world around him35 this work became very popular in antiquity was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470 and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the roman world and especially roman art roman technology and roman engineering the spanish scholar isidore of seville was the first christian writer to try to compile a summa of universal knowledge the etymologiae c 600625 also known by classicists as the origines abbreviated orig this encyclopediathe first such christian epitomeformed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 books37 based on hundreds of classical sources including the naturalis historia of the etymologiae in its time it was said quaecunque fere sciri debentur practically everything that it is necessary to know3834 among the areas covered were grammar rhetoric mathematics geometry music astronomy medicine law the catholic church and heretical sects pagan philosophers languages cities animals and birds the physical world geography public buildings roads metals rocks agriculture ships clothes food and tools another christian encyclopedia was the institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum of cassiodorus 543560 dedicated to the christian divinity and the seven liberal arts345 the encyclopedia of suda a massive 10thcentury byzantine encyclopedia had 30000 entries broadly alphabetically arranged many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost and often derived from medieval christian compilers34 from india the siribhoovalaya kannada variously dated to c 800 ad the 15th century39 or an even more recent time is a work of kannada literature written by kumudendu muni a jain monk40 it is unique because rather than employing alphabets it is composed entirely in kannada numerals many philosophies which existed in the jain classics are eloquently and skillfully interpreted in the work the 2nd century bc reference work shiben has been described as a chinese encyclopedia of genealogies while the huanglan completed in the 220s was an early leishu encyclopedia the yiwen leiju completed in 624 was a landmark literature encyclopedia of the early tang dynasty the enormous encyclopedic works of the four great books of song compiled by the 11th century during the early song dynasty 9601279 was a massive literary undertaking for the time the last encyclopedia of the four the prime tortoise of the record bureau amounted to 94 million chinese characters in 1000 written volumes the yongle encyclopedia completed 1408 comprised 11095 volumes making it the largest paper encyclopedia in world history4142 there were many great encyclopedists throughout chinese history including the scientist and statesman shen kuo 10311095 with his dream pool essays of 1088 the statesman inventor and agronomist wang zhen active 12901333 with his nong shu of 1313 and song yingxing 15871666 with his tiangong kaiwu song yingxing was termed the diderot of china by british historian joseph needham43 before the advent of the printing press encyclopedic works were all handcopied and thus rarely available beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning they were expensive and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it the introduction of printing from asia allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her copy nuremberg chronicle from 1493 is one of the bestdocumented early printed booksan incunabulumand one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text both latin and german editions were printed by anton koberger in nuremberg44 the de expetendis et fugiendis rebus by giorgio valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by aldo manuzio in venice this work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts however valla added the translation of ancient greek works on mathematics firstly by archimedes newly discovered and translated the margarita philosophica by gregor reisch printed in 1503 was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts financial commercial legal and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections to publish faster also publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias later rivalry grew causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws john harris is often credited with introducing the nowfamiliar alphabetic format in 1704 with his english lexicon technicum or a universal english dictionary of arts and sciences explaining not only the terms of art but the arts themselves to give its full title organized alphabetically its content does indeed contain an explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences but of the arts and sciences themselves sir isaac newton contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710 indeed the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live and transmit it to those who will come after us so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come and so that our offspring becoming better instructed will at the same time become more virtuous and happy and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race in the future years to come the encyclopdie ou dictionnaire raisonn des sciences des arts et des mtiers french for encyclopedia or a systematic dictionary of the sciences arts and crafts better known as the encyclopdie french siklpedi was a general encyclopedia published in france between 1751 and 1772 with later supplements revised editions an index and translations it had many contributors known among contemporaries as the encyclopdistes it was edited by denis diderot and until 1759 coedited by jean le rond dalembert46 the encyclopdie is most famous for representing the thought of the enlightenment according to diderot in the article encyclopdie the encyclopdies aim was to change the way people think and to allow people to inform themselves47 diderot hoped the encyclopdie would disseminate a vast amount of knowledge to the present and future generations48 thus it is an example of democratization of knowledge though the high price of the first edition especially 980 livres prevented it from being bought by much of the middle class49 the encyclopdia britannica latin for british encyclopaedia is a generalknowledge englishlanguage encyclopaedia it has been published since 1768 and after several ownership changes

and 1771 in edinburgh scotland in weekly installments that came together to form in three volumes at first the encyclopaedia grew quickly in size the second edition extended to 10 volumes and by its fourth edition 18011810 the britannica had expanded to 20 volumes since the beginning of the twentieth century its size has remained roughly steady with about 40 million words52 the britannicas rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors and the 9th 18751889 and 11th editions 1911 are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an american firm the britannica shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the north american market though published in the united states since 1901 the britannica has for the most part maintained british english spelling in 1932 the britannica adopted a policy of continuous revision in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted with every article updated on a schedule53 the publishers of comptons pictured encyclopedia had already pioneered such a policy54 the 15th edition 19742010 has a threepart structure a 12volume micropdia of short articles generally fewer than 750 words a 17volume macropdia of long articles two to 310 pages and a single propdia volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge the micropdia was meant for quick factchecking and as a guide to the macropdia readers are advised to study the propdia outline to understand a subjects context and to find more detailed articles in the 21st century the britannica suffered first from competition with the digital multimedia encyclopaedia microsoft encarta55 and later with the online peerproduced encyclopaedia wikipedia565758 the brockhaus enzyklopdie german for brockhaus encyclopedia is a germanlanguage encyclopedia which until 2009 was published by the f a brockhaus printing house the first edition originated in the

as of the 1990s two of the most prominent encyclopedias published in the united states were colliers encyclopedia and encyclopedia americana61 by the late 20th century encyclopedias were being published on cdroms for use with personal computers this was the usual way computer users accessed encyclopedic knowledge from the 1980s and 1990s later dvd discs replaced cdroms and by the mid2000s internet encyclopedias were dominant and replaced discbased software encyclopedias5 cdrom encyclopedias were usually a macos or microsoft windows 30 31 or 9598 application on a cdrom disc the user would execute the encyclopedias software program to see a menu that allowed them to start browsing the encyclopedias articles and most encyclopedias also supported a way to search the contents of the encyclopedia the article text was usually hyperlinked and also included photographs audio clips for example in articles about historical speeches or musical instruments and video clips in the cdrom age the video clips usually had a low resolution often 160x120 or 320x240 pixels such encyclopedias which made use of photos audio and video were also called multimedia encyclopedias microsofts encarta launched in 1993 was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent it featured around 25000 articles supplemented with 7000 highquality images 9 hours of audio files and 30 videos after sixteen years microsoft discontinued the encarta line of products in 2009 with the rise of the internet62 other examples of cdrom encyclopedia are grolier multimedia encyclopedia and britannica digital encyclopedias enable encyclopedia services such as wikimedia enterprise to facilitate programmatic access to the content63 the concept of a free encyclopedia began with the interpedia proposal on usenet in 1993 which outlined an internetbased online encyclopedia to which anyone could submit content that would be freely accessible early projects in this vein included everything2 and open site in 1999 richard stallman proposed the gnupedia an online encyclopedia which similar to the gnu operating system would be a generic resource the concept was very similar to interpedia but more in line with stallmans gnu philosophy it was not until nupedia and later wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project could be established on the internet the english wikipedia which was started in 2001 became the worlds largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300000 article stage65 by late 2005 wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the copyleft gnu free documentation license as of august 2009update wikipedia had over 3 million articles in english and well over 10 million combined articles in over 250 languages today wikipedia
