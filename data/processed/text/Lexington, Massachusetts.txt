thousands of years prior to european colonization of the americas as attested by a woodlandera archaeological site near loring hill south of the town center2 at the time of european contact the area may have been a border region between naumkeag or pawtucket to the northeast massachusett to the south and nipmuc to the west though the land was eventually purchased from the naumkeag2345 the contact period introduced a number of european infectious diseases which would decimate native populations in virgin soil epidemics leaving the area largely uncontested upon the arrival of large groups of english settlers in the puritan great migration in 1639 the massachusetts general court purchased the land that would become presentday lexington then within the boundaries of cambridge from the

incorporated as a separate town in 1713 it was then that it got the name lexington7 how the town received its name is the subject of some controversy one view is that it was named in honor of lord
