nokia bell labsb commonly referred to as bell labs is an american industrial research and development company owned by finnish technology company nokia with headquarters located in murray hill new jersey the company operates several laboratories in the united states and around the world as a former subsidiary of the american telephone and telegraph company att bell labs and its researchers have been credited with the development of radio astronomy the transistor the laser the photovoltaic cell the chargecoupled device ccd information theory the unix operating system and the programming languages b c c s snobol awk ampl and others throughout the 20th century eleven nobel prizes and five turing awards have been awarded for work completed at bell laboratories1 bell labs had its origin in the complex corporate organization of the bell system telephone conglomerate the laboratory began operating in the late 19th century as the western electric engineering department located at 463 west street in new york city after years of advancing telecommunication innovations the department was reformed into bell telephone laboratories in 1925 and placed under the shared ownership of western electric and the american telephone and telegraph company in the 1960s laboratory and company headquarters were moved to murray hill new jersey its alumni during this time include a plethora of worldrenowned scientists and engineers with the breakup of the bell system bell labs became a subsidiary of att technologies in 1984 which resulted in a drastic decline in its funding23 in 1996 att spun off att technologies which was renamed to lucent technologies using the murray hill site for headquarters bell laboratories was split with att retaining parts as att laboratories in 2006 lucent merged with french telecommunication company alcatel to form alcatellucent which was acquired by nokia in 2016 in 1880 when the french government awarded alexander graham bell the volta prize of 50000 francs for the invention of the telephone equivalent to about us10000 at the time or about 340000 now4 he used the award to fund the volta laboratory also known as the alexander graham bell laboratory in washington dc in collaboration with sumner tainter and bells cousin chichester bell5 the laboratory was variously known as the volta bureau the bell carriage house the bell laboratory and the volta laboratory it focused on the analysis recording and transmission of sound bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education advancing the diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf5 this resulted in the founding of the volta bureau c 1887 at the washington dc home of his father linguist alexander melville bell the carriage house there at 1527 35th street nw became their headquarters in 18895 in 1893 bell constructed a new building close by at 1537 35th street nw specifically to house the lab5 this building was declared a national historic landmark in 1972678 after the invention of the telephone bell maintained a relatively distant role with the bell system as a whole but continued to pursue his own personal research interests9 the bell patent association was formed by alexander graham bell thomas sanders and gardiner hubbard when filing the first patents for the telephone in 1876 bell telephone company the first telephone company was formed a year later it later became a part of the american bell telephone company in 1884 the american bell telephone company created the mechanical department from the electrical and patent department formed a year earlier the american telephone and telegraph company and its own subsidiary company took control of american bell and the bell system by 1899 american bell held a controlling interest in western electric which was the manufacturing arm of the business whereas att was doing research into the service providers1011 in 1896 western electric bought property at 463 west street to centralize the manufacturers and engineers which had been supplying att with such technology as telephones telephone exchange switches and transmission equipment during the early 20th century several historically significant laboratories were established in 1915 the first radio transmissions were made from a shack in montauk long island that same year tests were performed on the first transoceanic radio telephone at a house in arlington county virginia a radio reception laboratory was established in 1919 in the cliffwood section of aberdeen township new jersey additionally for 1919 a transmission studies site was established in phoenixville pennsylvania that built in 1929 the coaxial conductor line for first tests of longdistance transmission in various frequencies12 on january 1 1925 bell telephone laboratories inc was organized to consolidate the development and research activities in the communication field and allied sciences for the bell system ownership was evenly shared between western electric and att the new company had 3600 engineers scientists and support staff its 400000squarefoot 37000 m2 space was expanded with a new building occupying about one quarter of a city block13 the first chairman of the board of directors was john j carty atts vice president and the first president was frank b jewett13 also a board member who stayed there until 1940141516 the operations were directed by e b craft executive vicepresident and formerly chief engineer at western electric in the early 1920s a few outdoor facilities and radio communications development facilities were developed in 1925 the test plot studies were established at gulfport mississippi where there were numerous telephone pole samples established for wood preservation at the deal new jersey location work was done on shiptoshore radio telephony in 1926 in the whippany section of hanover township new jersey land was acquired and established for the development of a 50kilowatt broadcast transmitter in 1931 whippany increased with 75 acres 30 ha added from a nearby property in 1928 a 15acre 61 ha site in chester township new jersey was leased for outdoor tests though the facility became inadequate for such purposes in 1930 the chester location required the purchase of an additional 85 acres 34 ha of land to be used for a new outdoor plant development laboratory prior to chester being established a test plot was installed in limon colorado in 1929 similar to the one in gulfport the three test plots at gulfport limon and chester were outdoor facilities for preservatives and prolonging the use of telephone poles additionally in 1929 a land expansion was done at the deal labs to 208 acres 84 ha this added land increased the facility for radio transmission studies17 the beginning of 1930s established three facilities with radio communications experiments and chemical aspects testing by 1939 the summit new jersey chemical laboratory was nearly 10 years established in a threestory building conducted experiments in corrosion using various fungicides tests on cables metallic components or wood for 1929 land was purchased in holmdel township new jersey for a radio reception laboratory to replace the cliffwood location that had been in operation since 1919 in 1930 the cliffwood location was ending its operations as holmdel was established whereas in 1930 a location in mendham township new jersey was established to continue radio receiver developments farther from the whippany location and eliminate transmitter interference at that facility with developments the mendham location worked on communication equipment and broadcast receivers these devices were used for marine aircraft and police services as well as the location performed precision frequencymeasuring apparatus field strength measurements and conducted radio interference18 by the early 1940s bell labs engineers and scientists had begun to move to other locations away from the congestion and environmental distractions of new york city and in 1967 bell laboratories headquarters was officially relocated to murray hill new jersey among the later bell laboratories locations in new jersey were holmdel township crawford hill the deal test site freehold lincroft long branch middletown neptune township princeton piscataway red bank chester township and whippany of these murray hill and crawford hill remain in existence the piscataway and red bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by telcordia technologies and the whippany site was purchased by bayer19 the largest grouping of people in the company was in illinois at napervillelisle in the chicago area which had the largest concentration of employees about 11000 prior to 2001 there also were groups of employees in indianapolis indiana columbus ohio north andover massachusetts allentown pennsylvania reading pennsylvania and breinigsville pennsylvania burlington north carolina 1950s1970s moved to greensboro 1980s and westminster colorado since 2001 many of the former locations have been scaled down or closed bells holmdel research and development lab a 1900000squarefoot 180000 m2 structure set on 473 acres 191 ha was closed in 2007 the mirroredglass building was designed by eero saarinen in august 2013 somerset development bought the building intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project a 2012 article expressed doubt on the success of the newly named bell works site20 but several large tenants had announced plans to move in through 2016 and 20172122 bell labs 1974 corporate directory listed 22 labs in the united states located in nokia bell labs 2024 website pictured 10 labs located in38 also listed as research locations without additional information was sunnyvale california us and tampere finland the naperville illinois bell labs location near chicago was considered the chicago innovation center and hosted nokias second annual algorithm world event in 202239 bell laboratories was and is regarded by many as the premier research facility of its type developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies including radio astronomy the transistor the laser information theory the operating system unix the programming languages c and c solar cells the chargecoupled device ccd and many other optical wireless and wired communications technologies and systems in 1924 bell labs physicist walter a shewhart proposed the control chart as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control shewharts methods were the basis for statistical process control spc the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes this was the origin of the modern quality control movement including six sigma in 1926 the laboratories invented an early synchronoussound motion picture system in competition with fox movietone and deforest phonofilm40 in 1927 a bell team headed by herbert e ives successfully transmitted longdistance 128line television images of secretary of commerce herbert hoover from washington to new york in 1928 the thermal noise in a resistor was first measured by john b johnson for which harry nyquist provided the theoretical analysis this is now termed johnsonnyquist noise during the 1920s the onetime pad cipher was invented by gilbert vernam and joseph mauborgne at the laboratories bell labs claude shannon later proved that it is unbreakable in 1928 harold black invented the negative feedback system commonly used in amplifiers later harry nyquist analyzed blacks design rule for negative feedback this work was published in 1932 and became known as the nyquist criterion in 1931 a foundation for radio astronomy was laid by karl jansky during his work investigating the origins of static on longdistance shortwave communications he discovered that radio waves were being emitted from the center of the galaxy in 1931 and 1932 the labs made experimental high fidelity long playing and even stereophonic recordings of the philadelphia orchestra conducted by leopold stokowski41 in 1933 stereo signals were transmitted live from philadelphia to washington dc in 1937 the vocoder an electronic speech compression device or codec and the voder the first electronic speech synthesizer were developed and demonstrated by homer dudley the voder being demonstrated at the 1939 new york worlds fair bell researcher clinton davisson shared the nobel prize in physics with george paget thomson for the discovery of electron diffraction which helped lay the foundation for solidstate electronics in the early 1940s the photovoltaic cell was developed by russell ohl in 1943 bell developed sigsaly the first digital scrambled speech transmission system used by the allies in world war ii the british wartime codebreaker alan turing visited the labs at this time working on speech encryption and meeting claude shannon42 bell labs quality assurance department gave the world and the united states such statisticians as walter a shewhart w edwards deming harold f dodge george d edwards harry romig r l jones paul olmstead egd paterson and mary n torrey during world war ii emergency technical committee quality control drawn mainly from bell labs statisticians was instrumental in advancing army and navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures in 1947 the transistor arguably the most important invention developed by bell laboratories was invented by john bardeen walter houser brattain and william bradford shockley who subsequently shared the nobel prize in physics in 1956 also in 1947 douglas h ring of bell labs introduced the idea using hexagonal cells to reuse frequencies in mobile radiotelephony laying the theoretical groundwork for modern cellular networks43 the same year richard hamming invented hamming codes for error detection and correction for patent reasons his result was not published until 1950 in 1948 a mathematical theory of communication one of the founding works in information theory was published by claude shannon in the bell system technical journal it built in part on earlier work in the field by bell researchers harry nyquist and ralph hartley but went much further bell labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade shannon was also the founder of modern cryptography with his 1949 paper communication theory of secrecy systems 4445 the 1950s also saw developments based upon information theory the central development was binary code systems efforts concentrated on the prime mission of supporting the bell system with engineering advances including the ncarrier system td microwave radio relay direct distance dialing erepeater wire spring relay and the number five crossbar switching system in 1952 william gardner pfann revealed the method of zone melting which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping in 1953 maurice karnaugh developed the karnaugh map used for managing of boolean algebraic expressions in january 1954 bell labs built one of the first completely transistorized computer machines56 tradic or flyable tradic57 for the united states air force with 10358 germanium pointcontact diodes and 684 bell labs type 1734 type a cartridge transistorscitation needed the design team was led by electrical engineer jean howard felker with james r harris and louis c brown charlie brown as the lead engineers on the project which started in 195158 the device took only 3 cubicfeet and consumed 100 watt power for its small and low powered design in comparison to the vacuum tube designs of the times the device could be installed in a b52 stratofortress bomber and had a performance up to one million logical operations a second the flyable program used a mylar sheet with punched holes instead of the removable plugboard59 in 1954 the first modern solar cell was invented at bell laboratories60 in 1955 carl frosch and lincoln derick discovered semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide61 in 1956 tat1 the first transatlantic communications cable to carry telephone conversations was laid between scotland and newfoundland in a joint effort by att bell laboratories and british and canadian telephone companies in 1957 max mathews created music one of the first computer programs to play electronic music robert c prim and joseph kruskal developed new greedy algorithms that revolutionized computer network design in 1957 frosch and derick using masking and predeposition were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors the first planar transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface they showed that silicon dioxide insulated protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer62 in 1958 a technical paper by arthur schawlow and charles hard townes first described the laser following frosch and derick research mohamed atalla and dawon kahng proposed a silicon mos transistor in 195963 and successfully demonstrated a working mos device with their bell labs team in 19606465 their team included e e labate and e i povilonis who fabricated the device m o thurston l a dasaro and j r ligenza who developed the diffusion processes and h k gummel and r lindner who characterized the device6667 k e daburlos and h j patterson of bell laboratories continued on the work of c frosch and l derick and developed a process similar to hoernis planar process about the same time68 jr ligenza and wg spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides fabricated a high quality sisio2 stack and published their results in 1960697071 on october 1 1960 the kwajalein field station was announced as a location for the nike zeus test program mr r w benfer was the first director to arrive shortly on october 5 for the program bell labs designed many of the major system elements and conducted fundamental investigations of phasecontrolled scanning antenna arrays72 in december 1960 ali javan phd physicist from the university of tehran iran with help by rolf seebach and his associates william bennett and donald heriot successfully operated the first gas laser the first continuouslight laser operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity in 1962 the electret microphone was invented by gerhard m sessler and james e west also in 1962 john r pierces vision of communications satellites was realized by the launch of telstar on july 10 1962 the telstar spacecraft was launched into orbit by nasa and it was designed and built by bell laboratories the first worldwide television broadcast was july 23 1962 with a press conference by president kennedy73 in spring 1964 the building of an electronic switching systems center was planned at bell laboratories near naperville illinois the building in 1966 would be called indian hill and development work from former electronic switching organization at holmdel and systems equipment engineering organization would occupy the laboratory with engineers from western electric hawthorne works scheduled for work were about 1200 people when completed in 1966 and peaked at 11000 before october 2001 lucent technologies downsizing occurred74 in 1964 the carbon dioxide laser was invented by kumar patel and the discoveryoperation of the ndyag laser was demonstrated by joseph e geusic et al experiments by myriam sarachik provided the first data that confirmed the kondo effect75 the research of philip w anderson into electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems led to improved understanding of metals and insulators for which he was awarded the nobel prize for physics in 197776 in 1965 penzias and wilson discovered the cosmic microwave background for which they were awarded the nobel prize in physics in 197877 frank w sinden edward e zajac ken knowlton and a michael noll made computeranimated movies during the early to mid1960s ken knowlton invented the computer animation language beflix the first digital computer art was created in 1962 by noll in 1966 orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing ofdm a key technology in wireless services was developed and patented by r w chang in december 1966 the new york city site was sold and became the westbeth artists community complex in 1968 molecular beam epitaxy was developed by jr arthur and ay cho molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time in 1969 dennis ritchie and ken thompson created the computer operating system unix for the support of telecommunication switching systems as well as generalpurpose computing also in 1969 the chargecoupled device ccd was invented by willard boyle and george e smith for which they were awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2009 from 1969 to 1971 aaron marcus the first graphic designer involved with computer graphics researched designed and programmed a prototype interactive pagelayout system for the picturephone the 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computerrelated inventions at the bell laboratories as part of the personal computing revolution in the 1970s major central office technology evolved from crossbar electromechanical relaybased technology and discrete transistor logic to bell labsdeveloped thick film hybrid and transistortransistor logic ttl stored programcontrolled switching systems 1a4 toll electronic switching systems ess and 2a local central offices produced at the bell labs naperville and western electric lisle illinois facilities this technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs the new ess also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain about 1970 the coax22 cable was developed by bell labs this coax cable with 22 strands had a total capacity of 132000 telephone calls previously a 12strand coax cable was used for lcarrier systems both of these types of cables were manufactured at western electrics baltimore works facility on machines designed by a western electric senior development engineer78 in 1970 a michael noll invented a tactile forcefeedback system coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display in 1971 an improved task priority system for computerized telephone exchange switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by erna schneider hoover who received one of the first software patents for it in 1972 dennis ritchie developed the compiled programming language c as a replacement for the interpreted language b which was then used in a worse is better rewrite of unix also the language awk was designed and implemented by alfred aho peter weinberger and brian kernighan of bell laboratories also in 1972 marc rochkind invented the source code control system in 1976 optical fiber systems were first tested in georgia production of their first internally designed microprocessor the bellmac8 began in 1977 in 1980 they demonstrated the first singlechip 32bit microprocessor the bellmac 32a which went into production in 1982 in 1978 the proprietary operating system oryxpecos was developed from scratch by bell labs in order to run atts largescale pbx switching equipment it was first used with atts flagship system 75 and until very recently was used in all variations up through and including definity g3 generic 3 switches now manufactured by avaya during the 1980s the operating system plan 9 from bell labs was developed extending the unix model also the radiodrum an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented in 1980 the tdma digital cellular telephone technology was patented in late 1981 the bell labs research organization internal use of a terminal called jerq led to the blit terminal being renamed by designers rob pike and bart locanthi jr for the unix operating system it was a programmable bitmap graphics terminal using multilayers of opened windows operated by a keyboard and a distinguished redcolored threebutton digitized mouse79 it was later known as the att 5620 dmd terminal for commercial sales the blit used the motorola 68000 microprocessor whereas the teletypeatt 5620 dot mapped display terminal used the western electric we32000 microprocessor80 the launching of the bell labs fellows award started in 1982 to recognize and honor scientists and engineers who have made outstanding and sustained rd contributions at att with a level of distinction as of the 2021 inductees 336 people have received the honor81 ken thompson and dennis ritchie were also bell labs fellows for 1982 ritchie started in 1967 at bell labs in the bell labs computer systems research department82 thompson started in 1966 both coinventors of the unix operating system and c language were also awarded decades later the 2011 japan prize for information and communications in 1982 fractional quantum hall effect was discovered by horst strmer and former bell laboratories researchers robert b laughlin and daniel c tsui they consequently won a nobel prize in 1998 for the discovery in 1984 the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by auston and others this type of antenna became an important component in terahertz timedomain spectroscopy in 1984 karmarkars algorithm for linear programming was developed by mathematician narendra karmarkar also in 1984 a divestiture agreement signed in 1982 with the american federal government forced the breakup of att and bellcore now iconectiv was split off from bell laboratories to provide the same rd functions for the newly created local exchange carriers att also was limited to using the bell trademark only in association with bell laboratories bell telephone laboratories inc became a wholly owned company of the new att technologies unit the former western electric the 5ess switch was developed during this transition the national medal of technology was awarded to bell labs the first corporation to achieve this honor in february 198583 in 1985 laser cooling was used to slow and manipulate atoms by steven chu and team in 1985 the modeling language a mathematical programming language ampl was developed by robert fourer david m gay and brian kernighan at bell laboratories also in 1985 bell laboratories was awarded the national medal of technology for contribution over decades to modern communication systems in 198584 the programming language c had its first commercial release85 bjarne stroustrup started developing c at bell laboratories in 1979 as an extension to the original c language85 arthur ashkin invented optical tweezers that grab particles atoms viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers a major breakthrough came in 1987 when ashkin used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them he immediately began studying biological systems using the optical tweezers which are now widely used to investigate the machinery of life86 he was awarded the nobel prize in physics 2018 for his work involving optical tweezers and their application to biological systems in the mid1980s the transmission system departments of bell labs developed highly reliable longhaul fiberoptic communications systems based on sonet and network operations techniques that made very highvolume nearinstantaneous communications across the north american continent possible failsafe and disasterrelated traffic management operations systems enhanced the usefulness of the fiber optics there was a synergy in the landbased and seabased fiber optic systems even though they were developed by different divisions within the company these systems are still in use throughout the us today charles a burrus became a bell labs fellow in 1988 for his work done as a technical staff member prior to this accomplishment was awarded in 1982 the att bell laboratories distinguished technical staff award charles started in 1955 at the holmdel bell labs location and retired in 1996 with consultations to lucent

40000 telephonecall capacity in the late 1980s realizing that voiceband modems were approaching the shannon limit on bit rate richard d gitlin jeanjacques werner and their colleagues pioneered a major breakthrough they invented dsl digital subscriber line the technology that achieved megabit transmission on installed copper telephone lines and this facilitated the broadband era88 bell labs john mayo received the national medal of technology in 199089 in may 1990 ronald snare was named att bell laboratories fellow for singular contributions to the development of the commonchannel signaling network and the signal transfer points globally this system began service in the united states in 197890 in the early 1990s approaches to increase modem speeds to 56k were explored at bell labs and early patents were filed in 1992 by ender ayanoglu nuri r dagdeviren and their colleagues91 the scientist w lincoln hawkins in 1992 received the national medal of technology for work done at bell labs89 in 1992 jack salz jack winters and richard d gitlin provided the foundational technology to demonstrate that adaptive antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver can substantially increase both the reliability via diversity and capacity via spatial multiplexing of wireless systems without expanding the bandwidth92 subsequently the blast system proposed by gerard foschini and colleagues dramatically expanded the capacity of wireless systems93 this technology known today as mimo multiple input multiple output was a significant factor in the standardization commercialization performance improvement and growth of cellular and wireless lan systems amos joel in 1993 received the national medal of technology89 two att bell labs scientists joel engel and richard frenkiel were honored with the national medal of technology in 199489 in 1994 the quantum cascade laser was invented by federico capasso alfred cho jerome faist and their collaborators also in 1994 peter shor devised his quantum factorization algorithm in 1996 scalpel electron lithography which prints features atoms wide on microchips was invented by lloyd harriott and his team the operating system inferno an update of plan 9 was created by dennis ritchie with others using the thennew concurrent programming language limbo a high performance database engine dali was developed which became datablitz in its product form94 in 1996 att spun off bell laboratories along with most of its equipment manufacturing business into a new company named lucent technologies att retained a small number of researchers who made up the staff of the newly created att labs lucy sanders was the third woman to receive the bell labs fellow award in 1996 for her work in creating a risc chip that made more phone calls possible using software and hardware on a single server she started in 1977 and was one of the few woman engineers at bell labs95 in november 1997 lucent planned a bell laboratories location at
