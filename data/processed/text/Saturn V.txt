the saturn vf is a retired american super heavylift launch vehicle developed by nasa under the apollo program for human exploration of the moon the rocket was humanrated had three stages and was powered by liquid fuel flown from 1967 to 1973 it was used for nine crewed flights to the moon and to launch skylab the first american space station as of 2025update the saturn v remains the only launch vehicle to have carried humans beyond low earth orbit leo the saturn v holds the record for the largest payload capacity to low earth orbit 140000 kg 310000 lb which included unburned propellant needed to send the apollo command and service module and lunar module to the moon the largest production model of the saturn family of rockets the saturn v was designed under the direction of wernher von braun at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the lead contractors for construction of the rocket were boeing north american aviation douglas aircraft company and ibm fifteen flightcapable vehicles were built not counting three used for ground testing a total of thirteen missions were launched from kennedy space center nine of which carried 24 astronauts to the moon from apollo 8 to apollo 17 in september 1945 german rocket technologist wernher von braun was brought under contract to the united states during operation paperclip5 operation paperclip authorized by president truman6 brought in over 1600 german rocket engineers and technicians to the united states7 von braun who had helped create the german v2 rocket8 was assigned to the united states army ordnance corps at fort strong massachusetts then at fort bliss texas9 during his time at fort bliss von braun and his team were not given much to work with in the first couple of months the germans were only given primitive or aged wooden workshops they were not allowed to leave fort bliss without a military escort either in 1950 von braun remarked to daniel lang a reporter at the new yorker at peenemnde we had been coddled here you were counting pennies10 however he wrote books and articles in popular magazines such as colliers1112 this approach changed in 1957 when the soviets launched sputnik 1 atop an r7 icbm which could carry a thermonuclear warhead to the us131415 the american army and government began putting more effort towards sending americans into space before the soviets16 the army turned to von brauns team who had created the jupiter series of rockets17 the juno i rocket launched the first american satellite in january 195818 von braun considered the jupiter series of rockets to be a prototype of the upcoming saturn series of rockets and referred to it as an infant saturn19 the saturn rocket family were named after the sixth planet from the sun because the design of the various saturn rockets evolved from the earlier jupiter vehicles which were named after the fifth planet from the sun20 between 1960 and 1962 the marshall space flight center msfc designed a series of saturn rockets that could be deployed for earth orbit and lunar missions21 nasa planned to use a saturn vehicle as part of the earth orbit rendezvous eor method for a lunar mission22 development on the saturn c3 rocket was just beginning when the msfc planned an even bigger rocket the saturn c4 which would use four f1 engines in its first stage and five j2 engines in its second stage23 on january 25 1962 nasa gave its approval to build the c5 the threestage rocket would consist of the sic first stage with five f1 engines the sii second stage with five j2 engines and the sivb third stage with a single j2 engine24 the c5 would undergo component testing even before the first model was constructed the sivb third stage would be used as the second stage for the c1b25 which would serve both to demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility for the c5 and to provide flight data critical to the development of the c526 rather than undergoing testing for each major component the c5 would be tested in an allup fashion meaning that the first test flight of the rocket would include complete versions of all three stages by testing all components at once far fewer test flights would be required before a crewed launch27 the c5 was confirmed as nasas choice for the apollo program in mid196226 and was named the saturn v in february 196328 in the same month the c designations were dropped the c1 became the saturn i and c1b became saturn ib2629 by november 1962 nasa had switched to and confirmed a lunar orbit rendezvous lor method for a lunar mission30 the outside contractors that were chosen for the construction were boeing sic31 north american aviation sii31 douglas aircraft sivb25 and ibm instrument unit32 early in the planning process nasa considered three methods for the moon mission earth orbit rendezvous eor direct ascent and lunar orbit rendezvous lor a direct ascent configuration would require an extremely large rocket to send a threeman spacecraft to land directly on the lunar surface with enough fuel to fly back to earth nasa proposed the nova for this method3334 an eor would launch the directlanding spacecraft in two smaller parts which would combine in earth orbit a lor mission would involve a single rocket launching two spacecraft a mother ship and a smaller twoman landing module which would rendezvous back with the main spacecraft in lunar orbit the lander would be discarded and the mother ship would return home34 originally in the early 1960s when the saturn project was transferred to nasa direct ascent was the preferred method33 at the same time the air force had been developing of a lunar mission named lunex which would use the direct ascent method the space systems division estimated that a mission to the moon using direct ascent could be done by 1967 at an estimated cost of 75 billion equivalent to 586 billion in 2023 nasa dismissed both of the rendezvous methods as dangerous and impractical von brauns team had shown an interest in using the eor method as early as 1958 arguing that smaller vehicles could be used35 around the same time thomas dolan and his team from the vought astronautics division became the first to study the lor method although his team presented their ideas to nasa nothing came from his proposal36 in 1960 several nasa officials including langley research center engineer john houbolt argued that a lunar orbit rendezvous provided the simplest landing on the moon with the most costefficient launch vehicle and the best chance to accomplish the lunar landing within the decade3722 throughout 1961 houbolt and his team went around convincing other research teams to pursue lor38 catching the attention of the chief of the engineering division james chamberlin although in charge of what would later become project gemini he proposed using a twoman spacecraft using lor to send a oneman lunar lander to the surface of the moon although chamberlins plan stalled it did mark a shift towards lor39 houbolt also managed to convince nasa official george low22 in june 1962 von braun announced lor would be msfcs choice40 as more nasa officials became convinced lor was officially selected and announced as the mission configuration for the apollo program on november 7 1962 by nasa administrator james e webb30 a boilerplate apollo spacecraft bp027 was used for all configurations of dynamic testing41 the boilerplate took the place of actual flight hardware boilerplate size shape mass and center of gravity were the same but it was not necessary for the entire apollo spacecraft to be completed to commence dynamic testing the boilerplate was outfitted with instrumentation to record data for engineering study and evaluation42 bp27 was accepted at the marshall space flight center in late september 196443 the third stage the sivbd arrived at msfc before any other saturn v stage because it was first needed for dynamic testing of the saturn ib rocket25 the third stage arrived on january 4 196544 next the instrument unit siu200d500d was built unlike the other major components of the rocket the instrument unit was built in huntsville alabama where the msfc is located32 the ring was completed in january 1965 and electronic components from ibm installed by february 1 like the third stage it arrived before the other stages because it was needed for dynamic testing in the saturn ib first4546 the first stage of the saturn v rocket sicd set out on the maiden voyage of nasa barge poseidon to marshall space flight center on october 6 1965 and arrived on october 1347 while the first stage was on its way dynamic testing for the saturn v program using the test rocket sa500d began on october 847 the first stage was lifted into place in the dynamic test stand january 13 196648 the second stage of the sa500d had a complex history originally nasa wanted to use the siid stage for its dynamic testing however in the spring of 1965 nasa canceled the production of the siid stage and instead opted to use the siis stage for its dynamic tests49 the siis stage which north american aviations space and information systems division sid at seal beach had completed by january 31 196550 was redesignated as siisd to be used for dynamic testing51 the siisd would rupture and be destroyed during a test on september 29 1965 at seal beach it was discovered that the test was exercising a considerable margin above the structural limits required for flight approximately 144 percent of its designed load limit5152 because of this nasa was forced to substitute the siit stage for testing53 in early 1966 the siit was redesignated siitd so it could be used for dynamic testing as well as engine firing54 on may 28 1966 siitd was undergoing a pressure test to find a hydrogen leak but the hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected unbeknownst to the secondshift crew as a result the crew believing that a valve was leaking liquid hydrogen began closing valves this caused the liquid hydrogen tank to over pressurize and explode injuring five men and hospitalizing two others5556 after the siitd was destroyed the siif stage was assigned to dynamic test duties the siif stage was at the kennedy space center being used as a nonflight version of the stage being shipped from seal beach california to kennedy space center where it arrived march 457 the siif now designated siifd arrived at the msfc on november 10 196658 dynamic testing examined the vehicles response to lateral longitudinal and torsional excitation simulating those that would be experienced in flight the vehicle was mounted on a hydrodynamic support system made up of four hydraulicpneumatic pedestals to permit a simulated unrestrained reaction engineers tested vibrations in one plane at a time with different amounts of ballast simulating fuel load at critical time points in the flight trajectory59 dynamic tests were conducted in three configurations one for each phase of saturn vpowered flight configuration i tested the entire stack for its bending and vibration characteristics as if the vehicle had just been launched configuration ii tested the stack as if the first stage had jettisoned and the second stage were firing60 and configuration iii tested only the third stage and apollo spacecraft61 tests began with configuration iii in the saturn ib dynamic test facility59 configuration iii testing took place in late 196562 configuration i testing followed in the saturn v dynamic test stand then configuration ii in the same place59 with all the components at msfc as of november 10 19666058 the second stage was stacked atop the first inside the dynamic test stand on november 23 the third stage was added to the stack november 30 and the instrument unit and boilerplate apollo were installed in december the rocket was stacked and ready for configuration one testing60 configuration one testing finished on march 1163 testing produced several minor irregularities indicating the need for possible engineering changes configuration two testing followed in which the first stage was removed from the stack to simulate conditions after the first stage had jettisoned64 on august 3 1967 msfc announced the successful completion of the dynamic test program thereby declaring the dynamics and structures of the saturn v ready for its first launch later in the year the dynamic testing resulted in several slight modifications to the final flight vehicle65 the size and payload capacity of the saturn v dwarfed those of all other previous rockets successfully flown at that time with the apollo spacecraft on top the saturn v stood 363 ft 111 m tall and ignoring the fins had a diameter of 33 ft 10 m at its base89 fully fueled the saturn v had a mass of 2822171 to 2965241 kg 6221823 to 6537238 lb90 with a low earth orbit leo payload capacity of about 140000 kg 310000 lb91 and could send about 43500 kg 95900 lb to the moon92 the saturn v was primarily designed by the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama25 the rocket used the powerful f1 and j2 rocket engines89 during testing at stennis space center the force developed by the engines shattered the windows of nearby houses93 designers decided early on to attempt to use as much technology from the saturn i program as possible for the saturn v consequently the sivb third stage of the saturn v was based on the sivb second stage of the saturn i94 the saturn v was primarily constructed of aluminum titanium polyurethane cork and asbestos95 blueprints and other plans of the rocket are available on microfilm at the marshall space flight center96 the saturn v consisted of three stagesthe sic first stage sii second stage sivb third stage and the instrument unit89 all three stages used liquid oxygen lox as the oxidizer the first stage used rp1 for fuel97 while the second and third stages used liquid hydrogen lh298 lh2 has a higher specific energy energy per unit mass than rp1 which makes it more suitable for higherenergy orbits such as the translunar injection required for apollo missions conversely rp1 offers higher energy density energy per unit volume and higher thrust than lh2 which makes it more suitable for reducing aerodynamic drag and gravity losses in the early stages of launch if the first stage had used lh2 the volume required would have been greater which would have been aerodynamically infeasible at the time31 the second and third stages also used small solidpropellant ullage motors that helped to separate the stages during the launch to ensure proper positioning of the liquid propellants for pump intake99 the sic was built by the boeing company at the michoud assembly facility new orleans and the mississippi test facility now known as the stennis space center hancock county mississippi100 most of its launch mass was propellant rp1 fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer101 the stage was 42 m 138 ft tall and 10 m 33 ft in diameter it provided 33000 kn 7500000 lbf of thrust at sea level the sic had a dry mass of about 137000 kg 303000 lb when fully fueled at launch it had a total mass of 2214000 kg 4881000 lb100 the sic was powered by five rocketdyne f1 engines arrayed in a quincunx the center engine was fixed while the four outer engines were hydraulically turned with gimbals to steer the rocket102 the sic had a burn time of approximately 150 seconds100 the sic structure design reflects the requirements of f1 engines propellants control instrumentation and interfacing systems the stage is primarily built of aluminum alloy specifically 7075 and 2219 aluminum alloys the major components are the forward skirt oxidizer tank intertank section fuel tank and thrust structure the aft end of the forward skirt is attached to the oxidizer liquid oxygen tank and the forward end interfaces with the sii the skin panels fabricated from 7075 aluminum are stiffened and strengthened by ring frames and stringers103 the 1310000 l 345000 us gal liquid oxygen tank is the structural link between the forward skirt and the intertank section ring baffles attached to the skin stiffeners stabilize the tank wall and serve to reduce liquid oxygen sloshing the tank is made of 2219 aluminum alloy and is a cylinder with ellipsoidal upper and lower bulkheads the skin thickness is tapered in eight steps from 065 cm 0254 in at the aft section to 048 cm 0190 in at the forward section the intertank structure helps provide structural continuity between the liquid oxygen and fuel tanks the skin panels and ring frames are fabricated from 7075 aluminum103 the 820000 l 216000 us gal fuel tank provides the structural link between the thrust and intertank structures it is cylindrical with ellipsoidal upper and lower bulkheads antislosh ring baffles are located on the inside wall of the tank and antivortex cruciform baffles are located in the lower bulkhead area five liquid oxygen ducts run from the liquid oxygen tank through the rp1 tank and terminate at the f1 engines the 2219 aluminum skin thickness is decreased in four steps from 049 cm 0193 in at the aft section to 043 cm 0170 in at the forward section103 the thrust structure assembly redistributes the loads of the five f1 engines to the periphery of the fuel tank it also provides support for the engine accessories base heat shield engine fairings and fins propellant lines retrorockets and environmental control ducts the lower thrust ring has four holddown points which support the fully loaded rocket and as necessary restrain the vehicle from lifting off at full f1 engine thrust the skin segments are fabricated from 7075 aluminum alloy103 the electrical power system of the sic is divided into three basic subsystems an operational power subsystem a measurement power subsystem and a visual instrumentation power subsystem onboard power is supplied by five 28volt batteries one each for the operational and measurement power systems the operational power system battery supplies power to operational loads such as valve controls purge and venting systems pressurization systems sequencing systems and flight control the measurement power system battery supplies power to measurement loads such as telemetry systems transducers multiplexers and transmitters both batteries supply power to their loads through a common main power distributor but each system is completely isolated from the other in the visual instrumentation system two batteries provide power for the liquidoxygen tank strobe lights while a third battery energizes the control circuits camera motors and thrusters of the filmcamera portion of the visual instrumentation system104 the instrumentation system monitors functional operations of stage systems and provides signals for vehicle tracking during the sic burn prior to liftoff measurements were telemetered by coaxial cable to ground support equipment during flight data is transmitted to ground stations over radio frequency links the offset doppler odop system uses the doppler principle to provide vehicle position and acceleration data during flight105 the sii was built by north american aviation at seal beach california using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen it had five rocketdyne j2 engines in arranged similarly to the sic106 and also used the four outer engines for control107 the sii was 2487 m 81 ft 7 in tall with a diameter of 10 m 33 ft identical to the sic the sii had a dry mass of about 43000 kg 95000 lb when fully fueled it weighed 470000 kg 1037000 lb the second stage accelerated the saturn v through the upper atmosphere with 4400 kn 1000000 lbf of thrust in a vacuum the sii had a burn time of 395 seconds108 when loaded with fuel more than 90 percent of the mass of the stage was propellant106 the sii consisted of a body shell structure forward and aft skirts and interstage a propellant tank structure liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks and a thrust structure the body shell structure consists of the forward skirt aft skirt and interstage the three are of the same basic design except that the aft skirt and interstage were generally of heavier construction because of higher structural loads placed on them each unit is a cylindrical shell of semimonocoque construction built of 7075 aluminum alloy material stiffened by external hatsection stringers and stabilized internally by circumferential ring frames the forward skirt has a basic skin thickness of 010 cm 0040 in while the aft skirt and interstage both have basic skin thicknesses of 018 cm 0071 in109 the thrust structure like the body shell structure is of semimonocoque construction but in the form of a truncated cone increasing in size from approximately 55 metres 18 ft to 10 metres 33 ft in diameter it is stiffened by circumferential ring frames and hatsection stringers like the body shell structure four pairs of thrust longerons two at each outboard engine location and a center engine support beam distribute the thrust loads of the j2 engines the shell structure is of 7075 aluminum alloy a fiberglass honeycomb heat shield supported from the lower portion of the thrust structure protects the stage base area from excessive temperatures109 the liquid hydrogen tank consists of a long cylinder with a concave modified ellipsoidal bulkhead forward and a convex modified ellipsoidal bulkhead aft the aft bulkhead is also used by the liquid oxygen tank the liquid hydrogen tank wall is composed of six cylindrical sections wall sections and bulkheads are all fabricated from 2014 aluminum alloy and are joined together by fusion welding the forward bulkhead has an 11 m 36 ft diameter wide access manhole built into its center the common bulkhead is an adhesivebonded sandwich assembly employing facing sheets of 2014 aluminum alloy and fiberglassphenolic honeycomb core to prevent heat transfer and retain the cryogenic properties of the two fluids to which it was exposed109 the liquid oxygen tank consists of ellipsoidal fore and aft halves the tank is fitted with three ringtype slosh baffles to control propellant sloshing and minimize surface disturbances and cruciform baffles to prevent the generation of vortices at the tank outlet ducts and to minimize residuals a sixport sump assembly located at the lowest point of the tank provides a fill and drain opening and openings for five engine feed lines110 the sii electrical system consists of the electrical power and electrical control subsystems the electrical power system provides the stage with the electrical power source and distribution the electrical power system consists of six dc bus systems and a ground supplied ac bus system in flight the electrical power system busses are energized by four zincsilver oxide batteries the electrical control system interfaces with the instrument unit iu to accomplish the mission requirements of the stage the launch vehicle digital computer lvdc in the iu controls inflight sequencing of stage functions through the stage switch selector the stage switch selector can provide up to 112 individual outputs in response to the appropriate commands these outputs are routed through the stage electrical sequence controller or the separation controller to accomplish the directed operation111 the sii instrumentation system consists of both operational and rd measurement and telemetry systems the measurement system monitors and measures conditions on the stage while the telemetry system transmits this information to ground stations the measurement system consists of transducers signal conditioners and distribution equipment necessary to provide the required measurement ranges and to present suitably scaled signals to the telemetry system the measurement system monitors numerous stage conditions and characteristics this data is processed and conditioned into a form acceptable to the telemetry systems the telemetry system accepts the signals produced by the measuring portion of the instrumentation system and transmits them to the ground stations telemetry equipment includes signal multiplexers subcarrier oscillators amplifiers modulators transmitters rf power amplifiers rf multiplexers and an omnidirectional system of four antennas112 the sivb stage was built by douglas aircraft company at huntington beach california113 it had one rocketdyne j2 engine and used liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen1 the sivb used a common bulkhead to separate the two tanks114 it was 1786 m 58 ft 7 in tall with a diameter of 660 m 21 ft 8 in and was also designed with high mass efficiency though not quite as aggressively as the sii the sivb had a dry mass of about 15200 kg 33600 lb and when fully fueled weighed about 120500 kg 265600 lb1 the sivb had a burn time of 165 seconds the first burn and 312 seconds for the second burn its single j2 engine produced 1000 kn 225000 lbf of thrust1 the sivb consists of the following structural assemblies the forward skirt propellant tanks aft skirt thrust structure and aft interstage these assemblies with the exception of the propellant tanks are all of a skinstringer type aluminum alloy airframe construction in addition there are two longitudinal tunnels which house wiring pressurization lines and propellant dispersion systems the tunnel covers are made of aluminum stiffened by internal ribs the forward skirt cylindrical in shape extends forward from the intersection of the liquid hydrogen tank sidewall and the forward dome providing a hard attach point for the instrument unit iu it is the load supporting member between the liquid hydrogen tank and the iu an access door in the iu allows servicing of the equipment in the forward skirt114 the thrust structure assembly is an inverted truncated cone attached at its large end to the aft dome of the liquid oxygen tank and attached at its small end to the engine mount it provides the attach point for the j2 engine and distributes the engine thrust over the entire tank circumference attached externally to the thrust structure are the engine piping wiring and interface panels eight ambient helium spheres hydraulic system oxygenhydrogen burner and some of the engine and liquid oxygen tank instrumentation114 the propellant tank is cylindrical with a hemispherical dome at each end and a common bulkhead to separate the liquid oxygen from the liquid hydrogen this bulkhead is of sandwich type construction consisting of two parallel hemispherical shaped 2014 aluminum alloy domes bonded to and separated by a fiberglassphenolic honeycomb core the internal surface of the liquid hydrogen tank is machinemilled in a waffle pattern to obtain required tank stiffness with minimum structural weight attached to the

fill pressurization and vent pipes attached externally to the propellant tank are helium pipes propellant dispersion components and wiring which passes through two tunnel fairings114 the electrical system of the sivb comprises of two major subsystems the electrical power subsystem which consists of all power sources on the stage and the electrical control subsystem which distributes power and control signals to various loads throughout the stage115 onboard power is supplied by four zincsilveroxide batteries two are located in the forward equipment area and two in the aft equipment area these batteries are activated during the final prelaunch preparations heaters and instrumentation probes are an integral part of each battery116 the electrical control subsystem function is to distribute the command signals required to control the electrical components of the stage the major components of the electrical control subsystem are the power and control distributors the sequencer assemblies and the pressure sensing and control devices117 the sivb instrumentation monitors functional operations of stage systems before liftoff measurements are telemetered by coaxial cable to ground support equipment during flight radio frequency antennae convey data to ground stations similar to the other two stages the telemetry system consists of a pulsecodemodulator pcm digital data acquisition system ddas for prelaunch checkout the stage also contains a pcm frequency modulated pcmfm system a fmfm system and a single sideband ssfm system for launch information the radio frequency rf subsystem consists of a pcmrf assembly bidirectional coupler rf detectors dc amplifiers coaxial switch dummy load rf power divider and associated cabling omnidirectional antenna pattern coverage is provided by the foldedsleeve dipoles the effective radiating power of the system is 20 watts nominal and 16 watts minimum118 the instrument unit iu is a cylindrical structure installed on top of the sivb the iu contains the guidance navigation and control equipment in addition it contains telemetry communications tracking and crew safety systems along with their supporting electrical power and environmental control systems119 developed from the saturn i iu the saturn vs iu was designed by the marshall space flight center and built by ibm at their huntsville alabama facility120 the basic iu structure is a short cylinder fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material the structure is fabricated from three honeycomb sandwich segments of equal length the top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich this type of construction was selected for its high strengthtoweight ratio acoustical insulation and thermal conductivity properties the cylinder is manufactured in three 120degree segments which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure the access door segment has an umbilical door as well as an equipmentpersonnel access door the access door has the requirement to carry flight loads and still be removable at any time prior to flight121 the iu has a diameter of 66 m 260 in a height of 091 m 36 in and a weight of around 2000 kg 4500 lb122 after the construction and ground testing of each stage was completed they were each shipped to the kennedy space center the first two stages were so massive that the only way to transport them was by barge123 starting with the sic3 the sic stages constructed in new orleans were transported by barge from the michoud assembly facility to their testing facility and then to the kennedy space center in cape canaveral florida124 the sii was constructed in seal beach california125 and traveled to kennedy space center on the usns point barrow126 the sivb was constructed in huntington beach california and was transported by air on the aero spacelines super guppy127 except for the sivb501 stage which was transported by sea128 after rounding florida all the stages transported by boat were moved down the intracoastal waterway across the gulf of mexico to san carlos bay from there they traveled across florida through the okeechobee waterway before traveling up the coast to cape canaveral and the vehicle assembly building129 upon arrival at the vehicle assembly building each stage was inspected in a horizontal position before being oriented vertically starting with the first stage and ending with the apollo spacecraft130 nasa also constructed a large spoolshaped sii second stage that could be used in place of stage if a particular stage was delayed these spools were identical to the real stage and contained the same electrical connections as the actual stages131132 nasa assembled the saturn v on a mobile launcher by using a 230 metric tons 250 short tons overhead bridge crane and slings to lift the first stage onto the mobile launcher the first stage is then held in place by four support arms the rest of the stages are then stacked vertically in order after assembly and testing were completed the entire stack was moved from the vehicle assembly building vab to the launch pad using the crawler transporter ct130 built by the marion power shovel company133 the ct ran on four doubletracked treads each with 57 shoes each shoe weighed around 900 kg 2000 lb each ct had a length of 40 m 130 ft and a width of 35 m 115 ft this transporter was also required to keep the rocket level within 10 minutes of arc 016 degrees as it traveled the 5535 km 3439 mi to the launch site134 especially at the 5 percent grade encountered at the launch pad135 from 1964 until 1973 6417 billion equivalent to 336 billion in 2023 was appropriated for the research and development and flights of the saturn v with the maximum being in 1966 with 12 billion equivalent to 861 billion in 2023136 that same year nasa received its largest total budget of 45 billion about 05 percent of the gross domestic product gdp of the united states at that time137 in the time frame from 1969 to 1971 the cost of launching a saturn v apollo mission was 185 million equivalent to 969 million in 2023138 the mobile service structure mss on which the saturn v sat on was moved to the launch pad at launch complex 39a around two months before launch moving the vehicle let technicians access parts normally inaccessible and allowed testing and other preparations to begin around 21 days before launch technicians fueled the first stage up with rp1 this was the only fuel that can could loaded prior to launch as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are cryogenic and could only be loaded a couple of hours before launch139 the precount operations started around six days before launch equipment was installed and additional testing was performed140 at t24 hours the saturn v was completely powered up using ground equipment and the kennedy space center began monitoring wind speeds141 at t9 hours before launch an 11hour hold would begin to allow work on any problems discovered after the backup crew of the mission entered the command module cm to set the switches and circuit breakers to a predetermined position at t7 hours 30 minutes the liquid oxygen tanks on all three stages began to be loaded142 and would finish an hour later143 at t5 hours the liquid hydrogen tanks began to be loaded starting with the second stage and then the third stage144 both the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks had to be continuously refilled as the previously loaded fuel boiled and evaporated144 at t3 hours 45 minutes the crew was awakened and shortly after another hold began the hold lasted an hour and a half allowing time to fix any remaining issues145 at t2 hours 40 minutes the crew entered the command module and prepared for launch146 with the hatch being closed 40 minutes later147 in the event of an abort the range safety officer would remotely shut down the engines and send a command for the explosive charges attached to the rocket to detonate these explosions would open the fuel and oxidizer tanks to help disperse the fuel and minimize mixing148149 around t40 minutes a test was conducted to see if the saturn v could pick up the signal with the explosives being armed at t5 minutes 30 seconds150 at t8 minutes the onboard computer the launch vehicle digital computer lvdc was armed151 at t5 minutes 45 seconds the final gonogo was given from the launch controllers at t4 minutes 30 seconds the terminal countdown sequencer tcs was armed and prepared to execute the countdown sequence automatically152 at t3 minutes 7 seconds the tcs began the automatic countdown sequence153 at t1697 seconds the tcs sent a signal to the lvdc giving it access to the internal gyroscopes and accelerometers154 at t89 seconds the firststage ignition sequence was initiated with155 the center engine being ignited first followed by opposing outboard pairs at 300millisecond intervals to reduce the structural loads on the rocket at t03 seconds the rocket was soft released in two stages first the holddown arms released the rocket second as the rocket began to accelerate upwards it was slowed by tapered metal pins being pulled through holes for half a second156157 at t063 seconds the iu umbilical cable was disconnected indicating to the lvdc that launch had occurred158 at about t17 seconds the vehicle yawed 125 away from the launch tower to ensure adequate clearance despite winds it took about 4 seconds for the rocket to clear the tower at an altitude of 140 m 450 ft the rocket rolled to the correct flight azimuth which varied from 72 to 108 degrees depending on the time and date of launch159160 at t206 seconds the four outboard engines were tilted toward outward in case of a premature outboard engine shutdown161 at around t1 minute the saturn v reached the speed of sound162160 at about t1 minute 6 seconds the rocket experienced maximum dynamic pressure max q dynamic pressure on a rocket varies with air density and relative velocity although velocity continues to increase air density decreases so quickly with altitude that dynamic pressure falls below max q162 as the saturn v consumed fuel its weight decreased increasing its speed this caused the crew to experience 4 g at t2 minutes 15 seconds to reduce the g forces the center engine was cut lowering the g forces to 3 g each f1 engine consumed 900000 kgmin 165 short tons at this time the saturn v had an altitude of 441 km 238 nmi weighted 1110000 kg 2450000 lb and had a speed of 71244 kmh 44269 mph 64928 fts163 when the optical depletion sensors detected low fuel or oxidizer the remaining four outboard engines were shut down this would happen around t2 minutes 40 seconds the saturn v had an altitude of 661 km 357 nmi weighed 830000 kg 1820000 lb and had a speed of 99508 kmh 61831 mph 90686 fts164 just before first stage separation on earlier apollo missions small ullage engines on the second stage were ignited for a few seconds to ensure the fuels were at the bottom of their tanks first stage separation occurred less than one second after the engines were cut off eight small solidfuel separation motors separated the sic from the rest of the vehicle the first stage would continue on a ballistic trajectory for another minute and 45 seconds before falling into the atlantic ocean about 560 km 350 mi downrange165166 after sic separation the five j2 engines were ignited and began providing thrust it took a couple of seconds for the j2 engines to reach full thrust167 at about t3 minutes 12 seconds the interstage ring dropped from the second stage the ring sitting only a 1 m 33 ft from the outboard j2 engines needed to fall cleanly without hitting them as it could have potentially damaged the engines shortly after interstage separation the launch escape system was also jettisoned168106 at about t3 minutes 24 seconds the saturn v switched from a preprogrammed trajectory to a closed loop or iterative guidance mode the preprogrammed trajectory was designed to keep the vehicle on its course but prioritized making sure that the aerodynamic forces on the saturn v did not exceed its limits the instrument unit computed in real time the most fuelefficient trajectory toward its target orbit if the instrument unit failed the crew could switch control of the saturn to the command modules computer take manual control or abort the flight169 at about t7 minutes 40 seconds the center engine shut down to reduce longitudinal pogo oscillations170 five level sensors in the bottom of each sii propellant tank were armed during sii flight allowing any two to trigger sii cutoff and staging when uncovered171 at about t9 minutes 8 seconds the rest of the j2 engines shut off and the process of separating the sii from the sivb began at this time the saturn v had an altitude of 1872 km 1011 nmi and had a speed of 248979 kmh 154709 mph 226906 fts two small ullage engines were ignited and retro motors were fired separating the sii from the rest of the rocket172 unlike the twoplane separation of the sic and sii stages the sii and sivb separated with a single step173 less than one second after the siis engines were cut off the sivbs single j2 engine was ignited taking about 5 seconds to reach full thrust174 the third stage burned for about 25 minutes until first cutoff at about t11 minutes 40 seconds the vehicle had an altitude of 1911 km 1032 nmi and had a speed of 28048 kmh 17428 mph 25561 fts unlike the previous two stages sivbs j2 engine was restarted for translunar injection tli175 after engine cutoff the saturn v entered an earth parking orbit 190 km 100 nmi above the earth the third stage remained attached to the spacecraft while it orbited the earth one and a half times176 tli came at about t2 hours 44 minutes after launch the j2 took around 10 seconds to reach full thrust177 the sivb burned for almost six minutes giving the spacecraft a velocity of about 390276 kmh 242506 mph 355676 fts178 about 40 minutes after tli the apollo command and service module csm separated from the third stage turned 180 degrees and docked with the lunar module lm which rode below the csm during launch the csm and lm separated from the spent third stage 50 minutes later in a maneuver known as transposition docking and extraction179 if it remained on the same trajectory as the spacecraft the sivb could have presented a collision hazard so its remaining propellants were vented and the auxiliary propulsion system was fired to move it away for lunar missions before apollo 13 the sivb was directed toward the moons trailing edge in its orbitslingshotting it beyond earth escape velocity and into solar orbit from apollo 13 onwards the sivb was sent to hit the moon180181 seismometers left behind by previous missions detected the impacts and the information helped map the internal structure of the moon182183 in 1965 the apollo applications program aap was created to explore scientific missions that could be performed using apollo hardware much of the planning centered on the idea of a space station von brauns earlier 1964 plans employed a wet workshop concept with a spent sii saturn v second stage being launched into orbit and outfitted in space the following year aap studied a smaller station using the saturn ib second stage by 1969 apollo funding cuts eliminated the possibility of procuring more apollo hardware and forced the cancellation of some later moon landing flights this freed up at least one saturn v allowing the wet workshop to be replaced with the dry workshop concept the stationnow known as skylab would be built on the ground from a surplus saturn ib second stage and launched atop the first two live stages of a saturn v184 a backup station constructed from a saturn v third stage was built and is now on display at the national air and space museum185 the only significant changes to the saturn v from the apollo configurations involved some modifications to the sii to act as the terminal stage for inserting the skylab payload into earth orbit186 the sii remained in orbit for almost two years before it made an uncontrolled reentry on january 11 1975187 in the early 1970s as the publics attention turned away from space exploration to other matters such as the vietnam war congress began to cut nasas budget the us government was less willing to continue funding nasa especially after the improvement of ussoviet relations188 after apollo the saturn v was planned to be the prime launch vehicle for prospector prospector was a proposed 330 kg 730 lb robotic rover similar to the two soviet lunokhod rovers189 the voyager mars probes and a scaledup version of the voyager interplanetary probes190 the saturn v was also to have been the launch vehicle for the nuclear rocket stage rift test program and for some versions of the upcoming nerva project191 all of these planned uses of the saturn v were canceled with cost being a major factor edgar cortright who had been the director of nasa langley stated decades later that jpl never liked the big approach they always argued against it i probably was the leading proponent in using the saturn v and i lost probably very wise that i lost192 the canceled second production run of saturn vs would very likely featured an uprated f1 engine in its first stage providing a substantial performance boost193 other likely changes would have been bigger fins194 a strengthened construction195 a stretched sic first stage196 and the hg3 engine for the upper stages197 a number of alternate saturn vehicles were proposed based on the saturn v ranging from the saturn int20 with an sivb stage and interstage mounted directly onto a sic198 through to the saturn v24l which would not only have five uprated f1 engines in the first stage but also four strapon boosters with two uprated f1 engines each giving a total of thirteen f1 engines firing at launch199 lack of a second saturn v production run killed these plans and left the united states without a super heavylift launch vehicle some in the us space community came to lament this situation200 the saturnshuttle could also have eliminated the space shuttle solid rocket boosters that ultimately precipitated the challenger accident in 1986201 on september 3 2002 astronomer bill yeung discovered a suspected asteroid which was given the discovery designation j002e3 it appeared to be in orbit around the earth and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide which was a major constituent of the paint used on the saturn v calculation of orbital parameters led to tentative identification as being the apollo 12 sivb stage207208 mission controllers had planned to send apollo 12s sivb into solar orbit after separation from the apollo spacecraft but it is believed the burn lasted too long and hence did not send it close enough to the moon so it remained in a barely stable orbit around the earth and moon in 1971 through a series of gravitational perturbations it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly captured earth orbit 31 years later it left earth orbit again in june 2003209
