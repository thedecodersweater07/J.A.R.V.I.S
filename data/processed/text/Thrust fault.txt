a thrust fault is a break in the earths crust across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks a thrust fault is a type of reverse fault that has a dip of 45 degrees or less12 if the angle of the fault plane is lower often less than 15 degrees from the horizontal3 and the displacement of the overlying block is large often in the kilometer range the fault is called an overthrust or overthrust fault4 erosion can remove part of the overlying block creating a fenster or window when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area when erosion removes most of the overlying block leaving islandlike remnants resting on the lower block the remnants are called klippen singular klippe if the fault plane terminates before it reaches the earths surface it is called a blind thrust fault because of the lack of surface evidence blind thrust faults are difficult to detect until rupture the destructive 1994 earthquake in northridge los angeles california was caused by a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault because of their low dip thrusts are also difficult to appreciate in mapping where lithological offsets are generally subtle and stratigraphic repetition is difficult to detect especially in peneplain areas thrust faults particularly those involved in thinskinned style of deformation have a socalled rampflat geometry thrusts mainly propagate along zones of weakness within a sedimentary sequence such as mudstones or halite layers these parts of the thrust are called decollements if the effectiveness of the decollement becomes reduced the thrust will tend to cut up the section to a higher stratigraphic level until it reaches another effective decollement where it can continue as bedding parallel flat the part of the thrust linking the two flats is known as a ramp and typically forms at an angle of about 1530 to the bedding continued displacement on a thrust over a ramp produces a characteristic fold geometry known as a ramp anticline or more generally as a faultbend fold faultpropagation folds form at the tip of a thrust fault where propagation along the decollement has ceased but displacement on the thrust behind the fault tip continues the formation of an asymmetric anticlinesyncline fold pair accommodates the continuing displacement as displacement continues the thrust tip starts to propagate along the axis of the syncline such structures are also known as tipline folds eventually the propagating thrust tip may reach another effective decollement layer and a composite fold structure will develop with faultbending and faultpropagation folds characteristics duplexes occur where two decollement levels are close to each other within a sedimentary sequence such as the top and base of a relatively strong sandstone layer bounded by two relatively weak mudstone layers when a thrust that has propagated along the lower detachment known as the floor thrust cuts up to the upper detachment known as the roof thrust it forms a ramp within the stronger layer with continued displacement on the thrust higher stresses are developed in the footwall of the ramp due to the bend on the fault this may cause renewed propagation along the floor thrust until it again cuts up to join the roof thrust further displacement then takes place via the newly created ramp this process may repeat many times forming a series of faultbounded thrust slices known as imbricates or horses each with the geometry of a faultbend fold of small displacement the final result is typically a lozengeshaped duplex most duplexes have only small displacements on the bounding faults between the horses which dip away from the foreland occasionally the displacement on the individual horses is more significant such that each horse lies more or less vertically above the other this is known as an antiformal stack or imbricate stack if the individual displacements are still greater the horses have a foreland dip duplexing is a very efficient mechanism of accommodating the shortening of the crust by thickening the section rather than by folding and deformation5 large overthrust faults occur in areas that have undergone great compressional forces these conditions exist in the orogenic belts that result from either two continental tectonic collisions or from subduction zone accretion the resultant compressional forces produce mountain ranges the himalayas the alps and the appalachians are prominent examples of compressional orogenies with numerous overthrust faults thrust faults occur in the foreland basin marginal to orogenic belts here compression does not result in appreciable mountain building which is mostly accommodated by folding and stacking of thrusts instead thrust faults generally cause a thickening of the stratigraphic section when thrusts are developed in orogens formed in previously rifted margins inversion of the buried paleorifts can induce the nucleation of thrust ramps6 foreland basin thrusts also usually observe the rampflat geometry with thrusts propagating within units at very low angle flats at 15 degrees and then moving upsection in steeper ramps at 520 degrees where they offset stratigraphic units thrusts have also been detected in cratonic settings where farforeland deformation has advanced into intracontinental areas6 thrusts and duplexes are also found in accretionary wedges in the ocean trench margin of subduction zones where oceanic sediments are scraped off the subducted plate and accumulate here the accretionary wedge must thicken by up to 200 and this is achieved by stacking thrust fault upon thrust fault in a melange of disrupted rock often with chaotic folding here ramp flat geometries are not usually observed because the compressional force is at a steep angle to the sedimentary layering thrust faults were unrecognised until the work of arnold escher von der linth albert heim and marcel alexandre bertrand in the alps working on the glarus thrust charles lapworth ben peach and john horne working on parts of the moine thrust in the scottish highlands alfred elis trnebohm in the scandinavian caledonides and r g mcconnell in the canadian rockies78 the realisation that older strata could via faulting be found above younger strata was arrived at more or less independently by geologists in all these areas during the 1880s geikie in 1884 coined the term thrustplane to describe this special set of faults he wrote by a system of reversed faults a group of strata is made to cover a great breadth of ground and actually to overlie higher members of the same series the most extraordinary dislocations however are those to which for distinction we have given the name of thrustplanes they are strictly reversed faults but with so low a hade that the rocks on their upthrown side have been as it were pushed horizontally forward910
