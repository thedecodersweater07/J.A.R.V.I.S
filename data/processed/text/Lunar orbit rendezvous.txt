lunar orbit rendezvous lor is a process for landing humans on the moon and returning them to earth it was utilized for the apollo program missions in the 1960s and 1970s in a lor mission a main spacecraft and a lunar lander travel to lunar orbit the lunar lander then independently descends to the surface of the moon while the main spacecraft remains in lunar orbit after completion of the mission there the lander returns to lunar orbit to rendezvous and redock with the main spacecraft then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload only the main spacecraft returns to earth1 lunar orbit rendezvous was first proposed in 1919 by ukrainian engineer yuri kondratyuk2 as the most economical way of sending a human on a roundtrip journey to the moon34 the most famous example involved project apollos command and service module csm and lunar module lm where they were both sent to a translunar flight in a single rocket stack however variants where the landers and main spacecraft travel separately such as the lunar landing plans proposed for shuttlederived heavy lift launch vehicle golden spike and the 20292030 chinese crewed effort are also considered to be lunar orbit rendezvous the main advantage of lor is the spacecraft payload saving due to the fact that the propellant necessary to return from lunar orbit back to earth need not be carried as dead weight down to the moon and back into lunar orbit this has a multiplicative effect because each pound of dead weight propellant used later has to be propelled by more propellant sooner and also because increased propellant requires increased tankage weight the resultant weight increase would also require more thrust for lunar landing which means larger and heavier engines5 another advantage is that the lunar lander can be designed for just that purpose rather than requiring the main spacecraft to also be made suitable for a lunar landing finally the second set of life support systems that the lunar lander requires can serve as a backup for the systems in the main spacecraft this redundancy saved the crew of apollo 13 when their command modules systems failed lunarorbit rendezvous was considered risky in 1962 because space rendezvous had not been achieved even in earth orbit if the lm could not reach the csm two astronauts would be stranded with no way to get back to earth or survive reentry into the atmosphere rendezvous was successfully demonstrated in 1965 and 1966 on six project gemini missionsnote 1 with the aid of radar and onboard computers it was also successfully done each of the eight times it was tried on apollo missionsnote 2 when the apollo moon landing program was started in 1961 it was assumed that the threeman command and service module combination csm would be used for takeoff from the lunar surface and return to earth it would therefore have to be landed on the moon by a larger rocket stage with landing gear legs resulting in a very large spacecraft in excess of 100000 pounds 45000 kg to be sent to the moon if this were done by direct ascent on a single launch vehicle the rocket required would have to be extremely large in the nova class the alternative to this would have been earth orbit rendezvous in which two or more rockets in the saturn class would launch parts of the complete spacecraft which would rendezvous in earth orbit before departing for the moon this would possibly include a separately launched earth departure stage or require onorbit refueling of the empty departure stage wernher von braun and heinzhermann koelle of the army ballistic missile agency presented lunar orbit rendezvous as an option for reaching the moon efficiently to the heads of nasa including abe silverstein in december 19586 during 1959 conrad lau of the chancevought astronautics division supervised a complete mission plan using lunar orbit rendezvous which was then sent to silverstein at nasa in january 1960 tom dolan who worked for lau was sent to explain the companys proposal to nasa engineers and management in february 196076 this alternative was then studied and promoted by jim chamberlin and owen maynard at the space task group in the 1960 early apollo feasibility studies8 this mode allowed a single saturn v to launch the csm to the moon with a smaller lunar excursion module lemnote 3 when the combined spacecraft reaches lunar orbit one of the three astronauts remains with the csm while the other two enter the lem undock and descend to the surface of the moon they then use the ascent stage of the lem to rejoin the csm in lunar orbit then discard the lem and use the csm for the return to earth this method was brought to the attention of nasa associate administrator robert seamans by langley research center engineer john c houbolt who led a team to develop it besides requiring less payload the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the lor approach the lems design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately 46 metres 15 ft above the surface as opposed to being on their backs in a command module lander at least 40 or 50 feet 12 or 15 m above the surface able to see it only through a television screen developing the lem as a second crewed vehicle provided the further advantage of redundant critical systems electrical power life support and propulsion which enabled it to be used as a lifeboat to keep the astronauts alive and get them home safely in the event of a critical csm system failure this was envisioned as a contingency but not made a part of the lem specifications as it turned out this capability proved invaluable in 1970 saving the lives of the apollo 13 astronauts when an oxygen tank explosion disabled the service module dr john houbolt would not let the advantages of lor be ignored as a member of lunar mission steering group houbolt had been studying various technical aspects of space rendezvous since 1959 and was convinced like several others at langley research center that lor was not only the most feasible way to make it to the moon before the decade was out it was the only way he had reported his findings to nasa on various occasions but felt strongly that the internal task forces to which he made presentations were following arbitrarily established ground rules according to houbolt these ground rules were constraining nasas thinking about the lunar missionand causing lor to be ruled out before it was fairly considered10 in november 1961 houbolt took the bold step of skipping proper channels and writing a ninepage private letter directly to associate administrator robert c seamans somewhat as a voice in the wilderness houbolt protested lors exclusion do we want to go to the moon or not the langley engineer asked why is nova with its ponderous size simply just accepted and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive i fully realize that contacting you in this manner is somewhat unorthodox houbolt admitted but the issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted1112 it took two weeks for seamans to reply to houbolts letter the associate administrator agreed that it would be extremely harmful to our organization and to the country if our qualified staff were unduly limited by restrictive guidelines he assured houbolt that nasa would in the future be paying more attention to lor than it had up to this time in the following months nasa did just that and to the surprise of many both inside and outside the agency lor quickly became the front runner several factors decided the issue in its favor first there was growing disenchantment with the idea of direct ascent due to the time and money it was going to take to develop a 50foot 15 m diameter nova rocket compared to the 33foot 10 m diameter saturn v second there was increasing technical apprehension over how the relatively large spacecraft demanded by earthorbit rendezvous would be able to maneuver to a soft landing on the moon as one nasa engineer who changed his mind explained the business of eyeballing that thing down to the moon really didnt have a satisfactory answer the best thing about lor was that it allowed us to build a separate vehicle for landing the first major group to change its opinion in favor of lor was robert gilruths space task group which was still located at langley but was soon to move to houston as the manned spacecraft center the second to come over was wernher von brauns team at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama these two powerful groups along with the engineers who had originally developed the plan at langley persuaded key officials at nasa headquarters notably administrator james webb who had been holding out for direct ascent that lor was the only way to land on the moon by 1969 webb approved lor in july 196213 the decision was officially announced at a press conference on july 11 196214 president kennedys science adviser jerome wiesner remained firmly opposed to lor1510 episode 5 of the 1998 television miniseries from the earth to the moon spider dramatizes john houbolts first attempt to convince nasa to adopt lor for the apollo program in 1961 and traces the development of the lm up to its first crewed test flight apollo 9 in 1969 the episode is named after the apollo 9 lunar module this article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the national aeronautics and space administration
