hemedti who also leads the broader janjaweed coalition several smaller armed groups have also taken part fighting has been concentrated in the capital khartoum where the conflict began with largescale battles and in the darfur region495051 many civilians in darfur have been reported dead as part of the masalit massacres which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide52 sudan has been described as facing the worlds worst humanitarian crisis nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger53 on 7 january 2025 the united states said it had determined that the rsf and allied militias committed genocide54 since gaining independence in 1956 sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts prolonged military rule two devastating civil wars and the darfur genocide the war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the rsf into the army following the 2021 coup starting with rsf attacks on government sites in khartoum and other cities the capital region was soon divided between the two factions and alburhan relocated his government to port sudan international efforts including the may 2023 jeddah declaration failed to stop the fighting while various rebel groups entered the war the splmnorth alhilu faction attacked the saf in the south the tamazuj movement joined the rsf and the saf gained support from factions of the sudan liberation movement and the justice and equality movement by late 2023 the rsf controlled most of darfur and advanced in khartoum kordofan and gezira the saf regained momentum in early 2024 making gains in omdurman and eventually retaking khartoum including the presidential palace and airport by march 2025 despite renewed negotiations no lasting ceasefire has been reached and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications famine alone has killed an estimated 522000 children while the overall death toll of the war including fatalities from violence starvation and disease is even higher thousands more remain missing or have been killed in targeted massacres primarily attributed to the rsf and allied militias4547 at least 61000 people have died in khartoum

arms shipments from china russia and turkey regional support for the rsf comes from the uae and chad while egypt supports the saf amid regional tensions the war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food water medicine and aid access widespread hospital closures disease outbreaks mass displacement looting of humanitarian supplies and the nearcollapse of education and infrastructure leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance there have been calls for more aid legal protections for humanitarian workers refugee support and an end to arms supplies to the rsf particularly by the uae both the saf and rsf have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media fake footage and aigenerated content to manipulate public perception discredit opponents and influence international opinion in response to the conflict the united states united kingdom canada and the european union imposed sanctions on individuals companies and entities linked to the saf and rsf for ceasefire violations human rights abuses and destabilizing activities since gaining independence in 1956 sudan has experienced 20 military coup attempts the most of any african nation57 sudan has usually been ruled by the military interspersed with short periods of democratic parliamentary rule5859 two civil wars 19551972 and 19832005 between the central government and the southern regions killed 15 million people and ultimately led to the independence of south sudan in 2011 separately the conflict in the western region of darfur displaced two million people and killed more than 20000060 by the turn of the 21st century sudans western darfur region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water in 2003 this situation erupted into a fullscale rebellion against government rule against which president and military strongman omar albashir vowed to use forceful action the resulting war in darfur was marked by widespread statesponsored acts of violence leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against albashir61 the initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300000 dead and 27 million forcibly displaced even though the intensity of the violence later declined the situation in the region remained far from peaceful62 to crush uprisings by nonarab tribes in the nuba mountains albashir relied upon the janjaweed a collection of arab militias that were drawn from cameltrading tribes which were active in darfur and portions of chad in 2013 albashir announced that the janjaweed would be reorganised as the rapid support forces rsf and he also announced that the rsf would be placed under the command of the janjaweeds commander mohamed hamdan dagalo more commonly known as hemedti63646566 the rsf perpetrated mass killings mass rapes pillage torture and destruction of villages they were accused of committing ethnic cleansing against the fur masalit and zaghawa peoples65 leaders of the rsf have been indicted for genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity by the international criminal court icc67 but hemedti was not personally implicated in the 20032004 atrocities62 in 2017 a new law gave the rsf the status of an independent security force65 hemedti received several gold mines in darfur as patronage from albashir and his personal wealth grew substantially6667 bashir sent rsf forces to quash a 2013 uprising in south darfur and deployed rsf units to fight in yemen and libya64 during this time the rsf developed a working relationship with the russian private military outfit wagner group68 these developments ensured that rsf forces grew into the tens of thousands and came to possess thousands of armed pickup trucks which regularly patrolled the streets of khartoum68 the bashir regime allowed the rsf and other armed groups to proliferate to prevent threats to its security from within the armed forces a practice known as coupproofing69 in december 2018 protests against albashirs regime began starting the first phase of the sudanese revolution eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression70 in april 2019 the military including the rsf ousted albashir in a coup dtat ending his three decades of rule the army established the transitional military council a junta666770 bashir was imprisoned in khartoum he was not turned over to the icc which had issued warrants for his arrest on charges of war crimes71 protests calling for civilian rule continued in june 2019 the tmcs security forces which included both the rsf and the saf perpetrated the khartoum massacre in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed72646670 and dozens were raped64 hemedti denied orchestrating the attack66 in august 2019 in response to international pressure and mediation by the african union and ethiopia the military agreed to share power in an interim joint civilianmilitary unity government the transitional sovereignty council headed by a civilian prime minister abdalla hamdok with elections to be held in 20236170 in october 2021 the military seized power in a coup led by sudanese armed forces saf leader abdel fattah alburhan and hemedti the transitional sovereignty council was reconstituted as a new military junta led by alburhan monopolizing power and halting sudans transition to democracy7173 the sudan liberation movement or army slm sla or slma is a rebel group active in darfur primarily composed of members of nonarab ethnic groups74 and established in response to their marginalization by the bashir regime7576 since 2006 the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the darfur peace agreement with some factions joining the government in khartoum777879 by 2023 the three most prominent factions were the slmminnawi under minni minnawi the slmalnur under abdul wahid alnur and the slmtambour under mustafa tambour the slmminnawi and slmtambour signed the 2020 juba peace agreement ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments but the slmalnur refused to sign and kept fighting8081 the splmn was founded by units of the predominantly south sudanese sudan peoples liberation movementarmy stationed in areas that remained in sudan following the south sudanese vote for independence in 2011 these forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of south kordofan and blue nile a few months later82 in 2017 the splmn split between a faction led by abdelaziz alhilu and one led by malik agar with alhilu demanding secularism as a condition for peace while agar did not agree with this83 during the sudanese revolution alhilus faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire84 in 2020 a peace agreement was signed between the sudanese government and agars faction79 with agar later joining the transitional sovereignty council in khartoum alhilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the sudanese government a few months later85 further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup and the alhilu faction instead signed an agreement with the slmalnur and the sudanese communist party agreeing to cooperate to draft a revolutionary charter and remove the military from power86 in the months after the 2021 coup the already weak sudanese economy steeply declined fueling wide protests demanding that the junta return power to civilian authorities87 tensions arose between alburhan and hemedti over alburhans restoration to the office of oldguard islamist officials who had dominated the omar albashir government hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that alburhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of khartoums traditional elite over sudanese politics this was a danger to the rsfs political position as said elites were hostile to hemedti due to his ethnic background as a darfuri arab88 hemedtis expression of regret over the october 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and alburhan73 tensions between the rsf and the saf began to escalate in february 2023 as the rsf began to recruit members across sudan87 throughout february and early march the rsf built up in the sudanese capital of khartoum until a deal was brokered on 11 march and the rsf withdrew8789 as part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the saf rsf and civilian leaders but these negotiations were delayed and halted by political disagreements90 chief among the disputes was the integration of the rsf into the military the rsf insisted on a 10year timetable for its integration into the regular army while the army demanded integration within two years9192 other contested issues included the status given to rsf officers in the future hierarchy and whether rsf forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than sudans commanderinchief alburhan93 on 11 april 2023 rsf forces deployed near the city of merowe as well as in khartoum94 government forces ordered them to leave and were refused this led to clashes when rsf forces took control of the soba military base south of khartoum94 on 13 april rsf forces began their mobilization raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta the saf declared the mobilization illegal95 on 15 april 2023 the rsf attacked saf bases across sudan including khartoum and its airport9196 there were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster sudan tv which was later captured by rsf forces97 bridges and roads in khartoum and its hinterland were closed by rsf command98 the next day saw a saf counteroffensive with the army retaking merowe airport alongside the headquarters of sudan tv and the state radio97 the sudan civil aviation authority closed the countrys airspace as fighting began99 telecommunications provider mtn shut down internet services and by 23 april there was a neartotal internet outage attributed to attacks on the electricity grid100101 sudanese international trade began to break down with maersk one of the largest shipping companies in the world announcing a pause on new shipments to the country102 hemedti directed his forces to capture or kill alburhan and rsf units engaged in pitched and bloody combat with the republican guard ultimately alburhan managed to evade capture or assassination but his base at the sudanese armed forces headquarters was placed under rsf siege rendering him unable to leave khartoum80103 in an interview with al jazeera hemedti accused alburhan and his commanders of forcing the rsf to start the war by scheming to bring deposed leader omar albashir back to power98 he called for the international community to intervene against alburhan claiming that the rsf was fighting against radical islamic militants104 following the first few days of war the saf brought in reinforcements from the ethiopian border105 although a ceasefire was announced for eid alfitr fighting continued across the country106107 combat was described as particularly intense along the highway from khartoum to port sudan and in the industrial zone of albagair108 intercommunal clashes were reported in blue nile state and in geneina109110 by the beginning of may the saf claimed to have weakened the rsfs combat capabilities and repelled its advances in multiple regions111 the sudanese police deployed its central reserve forces in the streets of khartoum in support of the saf claiming to have arrested several hundred rsf fighters112 the saf announced it was launching an allout attack on rsf in khartoum using air strikes and artillery113 air strikes and ground offensives against the rsf over the next few days caused significant damage to infrastructure but failed to dislodge rsf forces from their positions114115 following further threats to his life from hemedti alburhan gave a public video address from his besieged base at the army headquarters vowing to continue fighting116117 on 19 may alburhan officially removed hemedti as his deputy in the transitional sovereignty council and replaced him with former rebel leader and council member malik agar118 with alburhan trapped in khartoum agar became de facto leader of the sudanese government assuming responsibility for peace negotiations international visits and the daytoday running of the country80 international attention to the conflict resulted in the united nations human rights council calling a special session to address the violence voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses119 on 6 may delegates from the saf and the rsf met directly for the first time in jeddah saudi arabia for what was described by saudi arabia and the united states as prenegotiation talks120 after diplomatic lobbying from the saudis and americans the warring sides signed the treaty of jeddah on 20 may vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians protect relief workers and prohibit the use of civilians as human shields121 the agreement did not include a ceasefire and clashes resumed in geneina causing more casualties121 the united nations undersecretarygeneral for humanitarian affairs martin griffiths expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting122 the situation remained volatile with both sides trading blame for attacks on churches hospitals and embassies123124125 casualties mounted particularly in geneina where arab militias loyal to the rsf were accused of atrocities against nonarab residents126 a temporary ceasefire was signed and faced challenges as fighting persisted in khartoum and the agreedupon ceasefire time saw further violence127 between 28 and 97 people were reportedly killed by the rsf and arab militias when they attacked the predominantly masalit town of misterei in west darfur on 28 may128 as june began khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties129130 the rsf took control of several important cultural and government buildings including the national museum of sudan and the yarmouk military industrial complex131132 acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of sudans population133134 by july alburhan was still trapped at the army headquarters and unable to leave and to break him out the saf elected to send a column of troops to lift the siege of the base this force was ambushed by the rsf and defeated with the paramilitary claiming it had killed hundreds of soldiers and captured 90 vehicles along with the columns commander135 in response to the escalating violence in khartoum the saf increased the intensity of their airstrikes and artillery bombardment leading to heightened civilian casualties often numbering in the dozens per strike136137138 shelling by the rsf also increased in intensity leading to many civilian casualties in turn139140 heavy fighting continued in khartoum throughout august with clashes breaking out across the city the rsf laid siege to the safs armoured corps base breaching its defences and taking control of surrounding neighbourhoods141142 the saf also made offensives with the rsfcontrolled republican palace and yarmouk complex coming under saf air bombardment an offensive was launched against yarmouk but this was beaten back after the rsf shipped in reinforcements143 one of the few remaining bridges between khartoum and khartoum north was also destroyed by the saf in an attempt to deny the rsf freedom of movement144 on 24 august an saf operation successfully rescued alburhan from his besieged base at the army headquarters allowing him to head to port sudan and hold a cabinet meeting there145146 ceasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated leading to further clashes the saf and rsf engaged in mutual blame for incidents while the sudanese government took action against international envoys147 the saudi embassy in khartoum was attacked and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos148 amidst the turmoil sudan faced diplomatic strains with egypt leading to challenges for sudanese refugees seeking entry149150 with alburhan out of khartoum for the first time since the start of the war he was able to fly to egypt and hold a meeting with the egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi151 following this visit alburhan went on a tour of numerous countries heading to south sudan qatar eritrea turkey and uganda152 he then proceeded to new york city as head of the sudanese delegation to the 78th united nations general assembly where he urged the international community to declare the rsf a terrorist organization153154 the abdelaziz alhilu faction of the sudan peoples liberation movementnorth splmn broke a longstanding ceasefire agreement in june attacking saf units in kadugli kurmuk and dalang the latter coinciding with an attack by the rsf the saf claimed to have repelled the attacks15515 while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the saf and vowed to free the region from military occupation84 more than 35000 were displaced by the fighting84 speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between alhilu and the rsf or an attempt by alhilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group156 civil society organizations supporting the splmn claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the rsf157 alhilus faction launched further offensives in july moving into south kordofan and gaining control of several saf bases158159 in response the saf brought in artillery and heavily bombarded splmn positions158 further attacks by the group largely petered out after this with an assault on kadugli in september being pushed back by the saf160 in february 2025 the splmn alhilu signed the sudan founding charter drafted by the rsfled government of peace and unity officially allying itself with the rsf16 in darfur fighting and bloodshed were particularly fierce around the city of geneina where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred161 rsf forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the masalit population of geneina leading to accusations of ethnic cleansing162 on 4 august the rsf claimed that it had taken full control over all of central darfur163 a united nations investigation discovered numerous mass graves in darfur that contained masalit civilians164 the rsf and arab militias were additionally accused of having killed lawyers human rights monitors doctors and nonarab tribal leaders165 the governor of west darfur khamis abakar was abducted and killed by armed men in june hours after accusing the rsf of genocide and calling for international intervention in a tv interview166 the saf for their part conducted indiscriminate airstrikes against darfur that killed many civilians especially in nyala167 tribal and rebel groups in darfur began to declare allegiance to one or the other of the warring parties a faction of the darfurbased sudan liberation movement led by mustafa tambour slmt joined the conflict in support of the saf5 in contrast the controversial tamazuj rebel group formally declared its alliance with the rsf joined by the leaders of seven arab tribes including that of hemedtis168169 as september arrived both sides made offensives in darfur the rsf took control of several towns in west darfur and also attacked the market of alfashir the capital of north darfur170 saf offensives saw success in central darfur with the army retaking parts of zalingei from the rsf171 fighting in darfur also began to increasingly spill over into north kordofan with the saf attacking rsf positions in the state capital of elobeid and clashes over the town of um rawaba172 both sides made withdrawals to end the month with the rsf retreating from um rawaba while the saf withdrew from tawila173174 by october 2023 the saf in darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to rsfimposed sieges and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem rsf advances175 on 26 october the rsf captured nyala sudans fourthlargest city after seizing control of the safs 16th infantry division headquarters176 the fall of nyala a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to central africa allowed the rsf to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other sudanese cities177 after nyalas fall rsf fighters turned their focus to zalingei the capital of central darfur the safs 21st infantry division stationed in zalingei fled the city without a fight and allowed the rsf to take it over178 in geneina reports emerged that tribal elders were attempting to broker the surrender of the saf garrison in the city to prevent bloodshed179 the army rejected the proposal raising fears of an imminent rsf assault on the city and causing civilians to flee across the border into chad180 the rsf besieged the headquarters of the safs 15th infantry division in geneina giving the garrison a sixhour ultimatum to surrender181 the base was captured two days later when the 15th withdrew from the area before fleeing to chad182 those left behind numbering in the hundreds were taken prisoner and paraded in rsf media with signs of abuse182 witnesses later reported mass atrocities perpetrated by the rsf in the city shortly after its seizure with a local rebel group claiming up to 2000 people were massacred in geneinas satellite town of ardamata183 with geneinas fall ed daein and alfashir were the last remaining capitals in darfur under government control with both cities under heavy rsf pressure179182 the rsf stormed and plundered the town of umm keddada east of alfashir after the saf garrison withdrew183 saf troops in alfashir itself were reported to be running low on food water and medicine due to the city being under siege and external forces noted the saf seemed incapable of stopping the rsf advance184185 ed daein fell in the early hours of 21 november with rsf forces taking control of the city after seizing the headquarters of the safs 20th infantry division186 saf garrisons in east darfur subsequently abandoned their positions and withdrew allowing the rsf to occupy the area187 in response to rsf gains in darfur and subsequent abuses the justice and equality movement sudan liberation movementarmy minnawi and other smaller rebel factions renounced their neutrality and declared war on the rsf4 attempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the treaty of jeddah but in late october the rsf and saf met once more in jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace188 this new round of talks was a failure with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire instead the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid189 on 3 december negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the saf and the rsf to open up aid channels190 with the failure of the talks in jeddah the east african intergovernmental authority on development igad hosted a peace summit in early december earlier attempts by igad to open negotiations had floundered after the saf had accused kenyan president william ruto of supporting the rsf191 igads talks appeared to make more progress than the jeddah negotiations with hemedti and alburhan agreeing to meet in person at some point in the future192 the rsf attacked the town of wad ashana in north kordofan on 1 october along a key commercial route193194 in west kordofan an uptick in fighting was reported with the rsf assaulting a vital oil field in baleela south of alfulah195 geolocated footage showed rsf fighters celebrating around baleela airport after allegedly capturing it196 the battle of khartoum continued with the rsf seizing the town of alaylafoun southeast of the capital on 6 october in the process the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure197198 by late october the rsf controlled most of khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases while alburhans government had largely relocated to port sudan199 the rsf sought to capitalize on its gains by stepping up attacks on saf positions in khartoum and omdurman days of fighting culminated in the destruction of the shambat bridge which connected khartoum north to omdurman over the nile the bridges destruction severed a critical rsf supply route200 this effectively cut the rsf off from its forces in omdurman giving the saf a strategic advantage201 in an attempt to gain a new crossing over the nile and supply its forces in omdurman the rsf launched an assault on the jebel aulia dam in the village of jabal awliya202 as jebel aulia could not be destroyed without flooding khartoum its capture would give the rsf a path over the nile the saf could not easily remove a weeklong battle commenced over the dam and its surrounding village which ended in an rsf victory the force captured the dam on 20 november and all saf resistance ceased in the village the following day203204 on 5 december local militias along with rsf soldiers attacked splmn alhilu forces in the village of tukma southeast of dalang in south kordofan resulting in the deaths of four people and the destruction of the village16 the rsf leadership not wanting hostilities with the thenneutral alhilu faction to escalate issued a statement condemning this attack and denouncing it as tribal violence205 on 8 december the rsf entered gedaref state for the first time205 pushing south from their gains around jebel aulia and khartoum rsf forces began to move into gezira state on 15 december advancing toward its capital wad madani206207 elsewhere in gezira the rsf made major gains taking control of the city of rufaa in the states east and entering the butana region208 after several days of fighting the rsf seized the hantoob bridge on wad madanis eastern outskirts crossing the blue nile and entering the city208 the army put up little resistance in wad madani itself the 1st division withdrawing from the city as the rsf took over209 the fall of wad madani was viewed as a major blow to the saf as it dramatically widened the frontline and opened up large parts of the country to potential rsf offensives209 the citys fall allowed the rsf to capture most of gezira and to make inroads in white nile state capturing the town of el geteina210 within a few days rsf fighters had advanced to within 25 km of sennar the largest city in sennar state210 over the next few weeks rsf forces ventured into rural areas of al qadarif state and river nile state without establishing a significant presence in sennar state the rsf made some further minor advances but had not attacked sennar city by the years end211 amid the deteriorating situation the saf was reported to be arming civilians while government officials in the east called on the population to mobilize212 alburhan gave a widely promoted public speech to soldiers in red sea state promising to arm civilian militias to fight the rsf and to fight against colonialism which was viewed by observers as a reference to the united arab emirates support of the rsf213 following the fall of wad madani efforts by igad to negotiate a ceasefire made progress as the safs weakened position made them more eager to enter talks whereas previously opposition from islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented alburhan from committing to a specific date now both he and hemedti agreed to meet on 28 december209214 a day before the meeting was due it was cancelled as hemedti recanted his desire to attend215 instead the rsf leader went on a diplomatic tour travelling on a chartered emirati jet and meeting with several african national leaders216 one visit that was particularly promoted was his visit to rwanda where he met with rwandan president paul kagame and visited the kigali genocide memorial213 on the tour hemedti also met with former prime minister hamdok and his taqaddum organisation in addis ababa with the rsf agreeing in a declaration negotiated with the taqaddum to release political prisoners open up humanitarian aid corridors and negotiate further with the saf217 this tour was regarded by observers as an attempt by hemedti to portray himself as the leader of sudan and improve his international image as his reputation had been severely damaged since the fall of wad madani due to largescale looting by rsf fighters216 on 5 january alburhan vowed to continue the war against the rsf and rejected the latest peace efforts declaring that war crimes committed by the rsf precluded negotiation218 on 14 january both hemedti and burhan received official invitations from igad to attend its upcoming summit on 18 january hemedti agreed to attend but burhan refused to do so on 16 january the sudanese government suspended its ties with igad accusing the body of violating sudanese sovereignty this effectively marked the end of igads attempts to mediate peace talks219 as 2024 began the rsf made attacks into south kordofan defeating saf forces in the town of habila in the nuba mountains and pushing toward dalang220 on 7 january the rsf attacked saf positions in dalang meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias213221 during the fighting the splmn alhilu entered the city taking control of several neighbourhoods splmn forces proceeded to attack the rsf and the paramilitary retreated from the city222 rsf fighters withdrawing from dalang entered the city of muglad in west kordofan easily taking control as the city had no organised saf presence west kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the messiria tribe but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the rsf was planning an attack on the encircled city of babanusa and the saf 22nd infantry division garrisoning it222 in january 2024 the rsf focused on consolidating its gains in gezira state fighting was reported on 17 january east of el manaqil the last major town not under rsf control the saf delivered weapons to the city by helicopter including selectively distributing them among civilians in the town attempting to bolster its defences sudans national intelligence and security service niss selectively recruited and armed civilians based on perceived loyalty223 on 24 january 2024 the rsf launched an attack on babanusa after encircling the city for months by 25 january the rsf gained control of the city centre and entered the headquarters of the 22nd infantry division224 until march 2024 the rsf maintained its position in gezira state but was unable to break through225 the rsf is recruiting in gezira state to try to capture territory in elgadarif from the saf226 the jem which has allied with the saf helped the saf build up its forces in elgadarif for a counteroffensive to try to retake wad madani in april 2024 the saf and its allies began the counteroffensive attacking from the east and west of wad madani in an attempt to retake it227 clashes were reported in almadina arab on 15 april228 in december 2024 the saf launched an offensive in southern gezira the saf was able to make small progress which involved recapturing the town of wad elhaddad a town on the border of sennar state it also was able to recapture um alqura but the rsf reoccupied the village229 in january 2025 the saf made the first major military operation of 2025 the army was able to make large gains in gezira and some gains in north kordofan on 8 january the saf had recaptured hajabdallah after a tense battle that inflicted losses on the rsf the saf stated that seven rsf vehicles were destroyed230 a day later the saf attacked rsf positions in alshabarga in the southeastern part of the state led by field commander bassam abu satour leading to the rsfs withdrawal and the saf recapturing the city while in the western part of the state the saf took control of the villages mahla tahla and alkumar aljaaliyeen231 on 10 january the saf recaptured um alqura while the sudan shield forces took wad alabyad232 these successful offensives led to the saf retaking control of wad madani on 11 january from three fronts after advancing in gezira and khartoum the saf launched a military operation in north kordofan for the first time after being on the defensive in darfur and kordofan from the start of the war the safs sayyad force captured the entirety of the umm ruwaba district233 by the start of february the saf had recaptured alhasaheisa tambul and rufaa this left the rsf in control of only northwestern gezira233 the saf then liberated the town of er rahad on 19 february and by 23 february the saf lifted the almost twoyear siege of el obeid234235 the saf gained ground in omdurman in february 2024 linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10month siege of their forces in the city centre the saf also took control of the alhilal stadium236 as of february 2024 the omdurman front is

a russian private military company to conduct these flights395 haftars support for a different faction in sudan than the egyptian government was commented on by the new arab which viewed it as a sign of egyptian weakness due to economic malaise and reliance on haftar to police eastern libya which constitutes a security concern for the egyptian government the new arab also viewed the lnas role in the conflict as signifying a shift in its diplomatic orientation from being primarily backed by egypt to being primarily backed by the united arab emirates396 for much of the sudanese civil war russia

fate408409 tensions escalated further with a february 2025 alliance between sudans rsf and the splmn a rebel group near the south sudanese border experts warn this could pull south sudan into the conflict especially if the sudanese army supports rival south sudanese militias in response with shared borders historical ties and existing political tensions between south sudans leaders president salva kiir mayardit and vice president riek machar the risk of both wars merging is high the strategic location of the rsfsplmn alliance also boosts smuggling and military operations weakening sudans
