wernher magnus maximilian freiherr von braun1 us vrnr vn bran vurnr von brown4 german vnhe fn ban 23 march 1912 16 june 1977 was a germanamerican aerospace engineer1 and space architect he was a member of the nazi party and allgemeine ss the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in nazi germany and later a pioneer of rocket and space technology in the united states5 as a young man von braun worked in nazi germanys rocket development program he helped design and codeveloped the v2 rocket at peenemnde army research center during world war ii the v2 became the first artificial object to travel into space on 20 june 1944 following the war he was secretly moved to the united states along with about 1600 other german scientists engineers and technicians as part of operation paperclip6 he worked for the united states army on an intermediaterange ballistic missile program and he developed the rockets that launched the united states first space satellite explorer 1 in 1958 he worked with walt disney on a series of films which popularized the idea of human space travel in the us and beyond from 1955 to 19577 in 1960 his group was assimilated into nasa where he served as director of the newly formed marshall space flight center and as the chief architect of the saturn v super heavylift launch vehicle that propelled the apollo spacecraft to the moon89 in 1967 von braun was inducted into the national academy of engineering and in 1975 he received the national medal of science von braun is a highly controversial figure widely seen as escaping justice for his awareness of nazi war crimes due to the americans desire to beat the soviets in the cold war10115 he is also sometimes described by others as the father of space travel12 the father of rocket science13 or the father of the american lunar program10 he advocated a human mission to mars wernher von braun was born on 23 march 1912 in the small town of wirsitz in the province of posen kingdom of prussia then part of the german empire now part of poland14 his father magnus freiherr von braun 18781972 was a civil servant and conservative politician he served as minister of agriculture in the federal government during the weimar republic his mother emmy von quistorp 18861959 traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval european royalty and was a descendant of philip iii of france valdemar i of denmark robert iii of scotland and edward iii of england1516 he had an older brother the west german diplomat sigismund von braun who served as secretary of state in the foreign office in the 1970s and a younger brother magnus von braun who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with chrysler17 the family moved to berlin brandenburg in 1915 where his father worked at the ministry of the interior after his confirmation his mother gave him a telescope and he developed a passion for astronomy18 von braun learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer he took lessons from the composer paul hindemith the few pieces of von brauns youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of hindemiths style19 11 he could play piano pieces of beethoven and bach from memory beginning in 1925 he attended a boarding school at ettersburg castle near weimar free state of thuringia where he did not do well in physics and mathematics there he acquired a copy of die rakete zu den planetenrumen 1923 by rocket into planetary space20 by rocket pioneer hermann oberth in 1928 his parents moved him to the hermannlietzinternat also a residential school on the east frisian north sea island of spiekeroog space travel had always fascinated him and from then on he applied himself to physics and mathematics to pursue his interest in rocket engineering2122 in 1928 the raketenrummel or rocket rumble fad initiated by fritz von opel and max valier was highly influential on von braun as a teenage space enthusiast he was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public opelrak rocket car demonstrations that he constructed his own homemade toy rocket car and caused a disruption in a crowded sidewalk by launching the toy wagon to which he had attached the largest firework rockets he could purchase he was later taken in for questioning by the local police until released to his father for disciplinary action the incident highlighted the young von brauns determination to dedicate his life to space travel1 6264 in 1930 von braun attended the technische hochschule berlin where he joined the spaceflight society verein fr raumschiffahrt or vfr cofounded by valier and worked with willy ley in his liquidfueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with others such as rolf engel rudolf nebel hermann oberth or paul ehmayr23 in spring 1932 he graduated with a diploma in mechanical engineering24 his early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology wanting to learn more about physics chemistry and astronomy von braun entered the friedrichwilhelm university of berlin for doctoral studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 193425 he also studied at eth zrich for a term from june to october 193125 in 1930 von braun attended a presentation given by auguste piccard after the talk the young student approached the famous pioneer of highaltitude balloon flight and stated to him you know i plan on traveling to the moon at some time piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words26 von braun was greatly influenced by oberth of whom he said hermann oberth was the first who when thinking about the possibility of spaceships grabbed a sliderule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs i myself owe to him not only the guidingstar of my life but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel a place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his groundbreaking contributions in the field of astronautics27 according to historian norman davies von braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in germany due to a curious oversight in the treaty of versailles which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to germany28 von braun was an opportunist who joined the nazi party to continue his work on rockets for nazi germany6 he applied for membership in the party on 12 november 1937 and was issued membership number 573869229 96 michael j neufeld an author of aerospace history and chief of the space history division at the smithsonians national air and space museum wrote that ten years after von braun obtained his nazi party membership he signed an affidavit for the us army though he stated the incorrect year29 96 in 1939 i was officially demanded to join the national socialist party at this time i was already technical director at the army rocket center at peenemnde baltic sea the technical work carried out there had in the meantime attracted more and more attention in higher levels thus my refusal to join the party would have meant that i would have to abandon the work of my life therefore i decided to join my membership in the party did not involve any political activity29 96 it has not been ascertained whether von brauns error with regard to the year was deliberate29 96 neufeld wrote von braun like other peenemnders was assigned to the local group in karlshagen there is no evidence that he did more than send in his monthly dues but he is seen in some photographs with the partys swastika pin in his lapel it was politically useful to demonstrate his membership29 96 von brauns later attitude toward the nazi regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex he said that he had been so influenced by the early nazi promise of release from the postworld war i economic effects that his patriotic feelings had increased30 in a 1952 memoir article he admitted that at that time he fared relatively rather well under totalitarianism29 9697 yet he also wrote that to us hitler was still only a pompous fool with a charlie chaplin moustache31 and that he perceived him as another napoleon who was wholly without scruples a godless man who thought himself the only god32 later examination of von brauns background conducted by the united states federal bureau of investigation suggests that his background check file contained no derogatory information pertaining to his involvement in the party but it was found that he had numerous letters of commendation for outstanding performance of duties during his time working under the nazi party33 overall fbi conclusions point to von brauns involvement in the nazi party to be purely for the advancement of his academic career or out of fear of imprisonment or execution33 von braun joined the ss horseback riding school on 1 november 1933 as an ssanwrter he left the following year34 63 in 1940 von braun joined the ss35 47 36 and was given the rank of untersturmfhrer in the allgemeiness and issued membership number 185068 121 in 1947 he gave the us war department this explanation in spring 1940 one ssstandartenfhrer sscolonel mller from greifswald a bigger town in the vicinity of peenemnde looked me up in my officeand told me that reichsfhrerss himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the ss i told him i was so busy with my rocket work that i had no time to spare for any political activity he then told me thatthe ss would cost me no time at all i would be awarded the rank of an untersturmfuehrer lieutenant and it were sic a very definite desire of himmler that i attend his invitation to join i asked mller to give me some time for reflection he agreed realizing that the matter was of highly political significance for the relation between the ss and the army i called immediately on my military superior dr dornberger he informed me that the ss had for a long time been trying to get their finger in the pie of the rocket work i asked him what to do he replied on the spot that if i wanted to continue our mutual work i had no alternative but to join37 when shown a picture of himself standing behind himmler von braun said that he had only worn the ss uniform that one time38 but in 2002 a former ss officer at peenemnde told the bbc that von braun had regularly worn the ss uniform to official meetings he began as an untersturmfhrer second lieutenant and was promoted three times by himmler the last time in june 1943 to sssturmbannfhrer major von braun later stated that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail3839 in 1932 von braun received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from technische hochschule berlin now technische universitt berlin germany during a period in 1931 von braun attended the eth zrich in switzerland during this time in switzerland von braun assisted professor hermann oberth in writing a book concerning the possibilities of creating and manufacturing liquidpropellant rockets shortly after this von braun founded his own private rocket development business in berlin and through which he made the first rocket fired by gasoline and liquid oxygen33 in 1932 having caught wind of von brauns rocket business the german army connected with von braun to pursue basic missile research and weather data experimentation33 von braun said that the german government financed the development of test stands and facilities for experimentation in darmstadt germany in 1939 von braun was appointed a technical advisor at peenemnde army research center on the baltic sea33 in 1933 von braun was working on his creative doctorate when the nazi party came to power in a coalition government in germany rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda an artillery captain walter dornberger arranged an ordnance department research grant for von braun who then worked next to dornbergers existing solidfuel rocket test site at kummersdorf40 von braun received his doctorate in physics aerospace engineering on 27 july 1934 from the university of berlin for a thesis titled about combustion tests his doctoral supervisor was erich schumann29 61 however this thesis represented only the public aspect of von brauns work his actual thesis entitled construction theoretical and experimental solution to the problem of the liquid propellant rocket dated 16 april 1934 detailed the construction and design of the a2 rocket it remained classified by the german army until its publication in 19604142 by the end of 1934 his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel a2 rockets that rose to heights of 22 and 35 km 2 mi43 von braun continued his guided missile work throughout world war two and met with adolf hitler on several occasions being formally decorated by hitler twice including being awarded the iron cross44 at the time germany was highly interested in american physicist robert h goddards research before 1939 german scientists occasionally contacted goddard directly with technical questions von braun used goddards plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the aggregat a series of rockets the first successful launch of an a4 took place on 3 october 194245 the a4 rocket became well known as the v246 in 1963 von braun reflected on the history of rocketry and said of goddards work his rockets may have been rather crude by presentday standards but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles25 goddard confirmed his work was used by von braun in 1944 shortly before the nazis began firing v2s at england a v2 crashed in sweden and some parts were sent to an annapolis lab where goddard was doing research for the navy if this was the socalled bckebo bomb it had been procured by the british in exchange for spitfires annapolis would have received some parts from them goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon47 later von braun said i have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the v2 rockets but there were victims on both sidesa war is a war and when my country is at war my duty is to help win that war1 351 the engineer who designed the v2 wernher von braun came to be feted as a hero of the space age the allies realised that the v2 was a machine unlike anything they had developed themselves in response to goddards statements von braun said at no time in germany did i or any of my associates ever see a goddard patent this was independently confirmed he wrote that statements that he had lifted goddards work were the furthest from the truth noting that goddards paper a method of reaching extreme altitudes which was studied by von braun and oberth lacked the specificity of liquidfuel experimentation with rockets it was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry as well as receiving us patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 1960s49 on 22 december 1942 adolf hitler ordered the production of the a4 as a vengeance weapon and the peenemnde group developed it to target london following von brauns 7 july 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an a4 taking off hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von braun a professor shortly thereafter50 by that time the british and soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von brauns team at peenemnde based on the intelligence provided by the polish underground home army over the nights of 1718 august 1943 raf bomber commands operation hydra dispatched raids on the peenemnde camp consisting of 596 aircraft and dropped 1800 tons of explosives51 the facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed however the raids killed von brauns engine designer walter thiel and chief engineer walther and the rocket program was delayed5253 the v2 became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the krmn line with the vertical launch of mw 18014 on 20 june 194454 the first combat a4 renamed the v2 vergeltungswaffe 2 retaliationvengeance weapon 2 for propaganda purposes was launched toward england on 7 september 1944 only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned1 184 doug millard of the science museum london states the v2 was a quantum leap of technological change we got to the moon using v2 technology but this was technology that was developed with massive resources including some particularly grim ones the v2 programme was hugely expensive in terms of lives with the nazis using slave labour to manufacture these rockets48 in 1936 von brauns rocketry team working at kummersdorf investigated installing liquidfuelled rockets in aircraft ernst heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts supplying a he72 and later two he112s for the experiments later in 1936 erich warsitz was seconded by the rlm to von braun and heinkel because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge55 30 after he familiarized warsitz with a teststand run showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft he asked are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air then warsitz you will be a famous man and later we will fly to the moon with you at the helm55 35 in june 1937 at neuhardenberg a large field about 70 km 43 mi east of berlin listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by warsitz at which time it was propelled by von brauns rocket power alone despite a wheelsup landing and the fuselage having been on fire it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a backthrust system through the rear55 51 at the same time hellmuth walters experiments into hydrogen peroxide based rockets were leading toward light and simple rockets that appeared wellsuited for aircraft installation also the firm of hellmuth walter at kiel had been commissioned by the rlm to build a rocket engine for the he112 so there were two different new rocket motor designs at neuhardenberg whereas von brauns engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and calcium permanganate as a catalyst von brauns engines used direct combustion and created fire while the walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction but both created thrust and provided high speed55 41 the subsequent flights with the he112 used the walterrocket instead of von brauns it was more reliable simpler to operate and safer for the test pilot warsitz55 55 ss general hans kammler who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including auschwitz had a reputation for brutality and had conceived the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers in the rocket program arthur rudolph chief engineer of the v2 rocket factory at peenemnde endorsed this idea in april 1943 when a labor shortage developed more people died building the v2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon56 von braun admitted visiting the plant at mittelwerk on many occasions6 and called conditions at the plant repulsive but stated that he had never personally witnessed any deaths or beatings although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred57 he denied ever having visited the mittelbaudora concentration camp where 20000 died from illness beatings hangings and intolerable working conditions58 some prisoners state that von braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it guy morand a french resistance fighter who was a prisoner in dora testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt von braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged59 while robert cazabonne another french prisoner stated that von braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes59 123124 however these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity60 former buchenwald inmate adam cabala stated that von braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers also the german scientists led by prof wernher von braun were aware of everything daily as they went along the corridors they saw the exhaustion of the inmates their arduous work and their pain not one single time did prof wernher von braun protest against this cruelty during his frequent stays at dora even the aspect of corpses did not touch him on a small area near the ambulance shed inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily but prof wernher von braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the corpses61 von braun later stated that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners but felt helpless to change the situation62 when asked if von braun could have protested against the brutal treatment of the slave laborers von braun team member konrad dannenberg a member of the nazi party since 1932 told the huntsville times if he had done it in my opinion he would have been shot on the spot63 according to andr sellier a french historian and survivor of the mittelbaudora concentration camp heinrich himmler had von braun come to his feldkommandostelle hochwald hq in east prussia in february 194464 to increase his powerbase within the nazi regime himmler was conspiring to use kammler to gain control of all german armament programs including the v2 program at peenemnde19 3840 he therefore recommended that von braun work more closely with kammler to solve the problems of the v2 von braun stated that he replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with dornbergers assistance65 von braun had been under sd surveillance since october 1943 a secret report stated that he and his colleagues klaus riedel and helmut grttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineers house one evening in early march 1944 that they were not working on a spaceship6 and that they felt the war was not going well this was considered a defeatist attitude a young female dentist who was an ss spy reported their comments himmlers unfounded allegations branding von braun and his colleagues as communist sympathizers and accusing them of sabotaging the v2 program coupled with von brauns regular piloting of a governmentprovided airplane that could facilitate an escape to britain led to their arrest by the gestapo19 3840 the unsuspecting von braun was detained on 14 march or 15 march66 1944 and was taken to a gestapo cell in stettin now szczecin poland19 3840 where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him67 through major hans georg klamroth in charge of the abwehr for peenemnde dornberger obtained von brauns conditional release and albert speer reichsminister for munitions and war production persuaded hitler to reinstate von braun so that the v2 program could continue619 3840 68 or turn into a v4 program the rheinbote as a shortrange ballistic rocket which in their view would be impossible without von brauns leadership32 in his memoirs speer states hitler had finally conceded that von braun was to be protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation69 upon investigation by the united states federal bureau of investigation on 1 may 1961 advised that there was no record of an arrest in their respective files70 suggesting that von brauns imprisonment was wiped from german prison records at a point after his conditional release or after the nazi regime had fallen the soviet army was about 160 km 100 mi from peenemnde in early 1945 when von braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender unwilling to go to the soviets von braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the americans kammler had ordered the relocation of his team to central germany however a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight deciding that kammlers order was their best bet to defect to the americans von braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around mittelwerk where they resumed their work in bleicherode and surrounding towns after the middle of february 1945 for fear of their documents being destroyed by the ss von braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned iron mine in the harz mountain range near goslar71 the us army counter intelligence corps managed to unveil the location after lengthy interrogations of von braun walter dornberger bernhard tessmann and dieter huzel and recovered 14 tons of v2 documents by 15 may 1945 from the british occupation zone2972 while on an official trip in march von braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel his injuries were serious but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so that he could leave the hospital due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later when his bones had to be rebroken and realigned71 in early april as the allied forces advanced deeper into germany kammler ordered the engineering team around 450 specialists to be moved by train into the town of oberammergau in the bavarian alps where they were closely guarded by the ss with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands however von braun managed to convince ss major kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for us bombers71 on 29 april 1945 oberammergau was captured by the allied forces who seized the majority of the engineering team73 nearing the end of the war hitler instructed ss troops to gas all technical men concerned with rocket development70 upon hearing this von braun commandeered a train and fled with other technical men to a location in the mountains of south germany after some time von braun and many of the others who made it to the mountains left their location to flee to advancing american lines in austria33 von braun and several members of the engineering team including dornberger made it to austria74 on 2 may 1945 upon finding an american private from the us 44th infantry division von brauns brother and fellow rocket engineer magnus approached the soldier on a bicycle calling out in broken english my name is magnus von braun my brother invented the v2 we want to surrender1775 after the surrender wernher von braun spoke to the press i myself and everybody you see here decided to go west and i think our decision was not one of expediency but a moral decision we knew that we had created a new means of warfare and the question as to what nation to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else we wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as germany had just been through and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured76 the american high command was well aware of how important their catch was von braun had been at the top of the black list the code name for the list of german scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by us military experts on 9 june 1945 two days before the originally scheduled handover of the nordhausen and bleicherode area in thuringia to the soviets us army major robert b staver chief of the jet propulsion section of the research and intelligence branch of the us army ordnance corps in london and lieutenant colonel r l williams took von braun and his department chiefs by jeep from garmisch to munich from where they were flown to nordhausen in the following days a larger group of rocket engineers among them helmut grttrup was evacuated from bleicherode 40 miles 64 km southwest to witzenhausen a small town in the american zone77 according to dornberger there the soviets tried to kidnap von braun at night using english uniforms americans recognized this and did not let them in78 von braun was briefly detained at the dustbin interrogation center at kransberg castle where the elite of nazi germanys economic scientific and technological sectors were debriefed by us and british intelligence officials79 initially he was recruited to the us under a program called operation overcast subsequently known as operation paperclip there is evidence however that british intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth eager to gain information that they knew us officials would deny them8081 the team included the young ls snell then the leading british rocket engineer later chief designer of rollsroyce limited and inventor of the concordes engines the specific information the british gleaned remained top secret both from the americans and from the other allies82 on 20 june 1945 us secretary of state edward stettinius jr approved the transfer of von braun and his specialists to the united states as one of his last acts in office this was announced to the public on 1 october 194583 in september 1945 von braun and other members of the peenemnde team signed a work contract with the united states army ordnance corps84 on 20 september 1945 the first seven technicians arrived in the united states at new castle army air field just south of wilmington delaware they were then flown to boston massachusetts and taken by boat to the army intelligence service post at fort strong in boston harbor later with the exception of von braun the men were transferred to aberdeen proving ground in maryland to sort out the peenemnde documents enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments85 finally von braun and his remaining peenemnde staff see list of german rocket scientists in the united states were transferred to their new home at fort bliss a large army installation just north of el paso texas von braun later wrote that he found it hard to develop a genuine emotional attachment to his new surroundings86 his chief design engineer walther reidel became the subject of a december 1946 article german scientist says american cooking tasteless dislikes rubberized chicken exposing the presence of von brauns team in the country and drawing criticism from albert einstein and john dingell86 requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected86 von braun was hypercritical of the slowness of the united states development of guided missiles his lab was never able to get sufficient funds to go on with their programs33 von braun remarked at peenemnde we had been coddled here you were counting pennies86 whereas von braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him at peenemnde he was now subordinate to pimply 26yearold jim hamill an army major who possessed only an undergraduate degree in engineering86 his loyal germans still addressed him as herr professor but hamill addressed him as wernher and never responded to von brauns request for more materials every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed86 while at fort bliss they trained military industrial and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles as part of the hermes project they helped refurbish assemble and launch a number of v2s that had been shipped from alliedoccupied germany to the white sands proving ground in new mexico they also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications since they were not permitted to leave fort bliss without military escort von braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only halfjokingly as pops prisoners of peace1 218 in 1950 at the start of the korean war von braun and his team were transferred to huntsville alabama his home for the next 20 years from 1952 to 195687 von braun led the armys rocket development team at redstone arsenal resulting in the redstone rocket which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the united states he personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation88 work on the redstone led to the development of the first highprecision inertial guidance system on the redstone rocket89 by 1953 von brauns title was chief guided missiles development division redstone arsenal90 as director of the development operations division of the army ballistic missile agency von braun with his team then developed the jupiterc a modified redstone rocket91 the jupiterc was the basis for the juno i rocket that successfully launched the wests first satellite explorer 1 on 31 january 1958 this event signaled the birth of americas space program92 repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in germany von braun while directing military rocket development in the real world continued to entertain his engineerscientists dream of a future in which rockets would be used for space exploration however he was no longer at risk of being fired as american public opinion of germans began to recover von braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas the 14 may 1950 headline of the huntsville times dr von braun says rocket flights possible to moon might have marked the beginning of these efforts von brauns ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories7 in 1952 von braun first published his concept of a crewed space station in a colliers weekly magazine series of articles titled man will conquer space soon these articles were illustrated by the space artist chesley bonestell and were influential in spreading his ideas frequently von braun worked with fellow germanborn space advocate and science writer willy ley to publish his concepts which unsurprisingly were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality93 the space station to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages was a toroid structure with a diameter of 250 feet 76 m this built on the concept of a rotating wheelshaped station introduced in 1929 by herman potonik in his book the problem of space travel the rocket motor the space station spun around a central docking nave to provide artificial gravity and was assembled in a 1075mile 1730 km twohour highinclination earth orbit allowing observation of essentially every point on earth on at least a daily basis the ultimate purpose of the space station was to provide an assembly platform for crewed lunar expeditions more than a decade later the movie version of 2001 a space odyssey drew heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station94 von braun envisioned these expeditions as very largescale undertakings with a total of 50 astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft two for crew one primarily for cargo each 49 m 16076 ft long and 33 m 10827 ft in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30 rocket propulsion engines95 upon arrival astronauts would establish a permanent lunar base in the sinus roris region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks this would include a 400 km 249 mi expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater harpalus and the mare imbrium foothills96 at this time von braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a human mission to mars that used the space station as a staging point his initial plans published in the mars project 1952 had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft each with a mass of 3720 metric tonnes three of them uncrewed and each carrying one 200tonne winged lander95 in addition to cargo and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70 astronauts the engineering and astronautical parameters of this gigantic mission were thoroughly calculated a later project was much more modest using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft in each case the expedition used minimumenergy hohmann transfer orbits for its trips to mars and back to earth97 before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to mars von braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject set in the year 1980 however 18 publishers rejected the manuscript98 von braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines to illustrate selected aspects of his mars project popularizations the complete manuscript titled project mars a technical tale did not appear as a printed book until december 200699 in the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program von braun also began working with walt disney and the disney studios as a technical director initially for three television films about space exploration the initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was man in space which first went on air on 9 march 1955 drawing 40 million viewers86100101 later in 1959 von braun published a short booklet condensed from episodes that had appeared in this week magazine before describing his updated concept of the first crewed lunar landing102 the scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the moon on an earlier mission the bruteforce direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages loosely based on the nova designs that were under discussion at this time after a night launch from a pacific island the first three stages brought the spacecraft with the two remaining upper stages attached to terrestrial escape velocity with each burn creating an acceleration of 89 times standard gravity the residual propellant in the third stage was used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole the fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity and the fifth stage was responsible for a deceleration during return to the earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing much in the way of the space shuttle one remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer von braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that became apparent only years later being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesickcheck quotation syntaxcitation needed in the first half of his life von braun was a nonpracticing perfunctory lutheran1 4 230 as described by ernst stuhlinger and frederick i ordway iii throughout his younger years von braun did not show signs of religious devotion or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings in fact he was known to his friends as a merry heathen frhlicher heide103 nevertheless in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the western allies rather than russians as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people whom he felt followed the bible in 19461 469 he attended church in el paso el paso county texas and underwent a religious conversion to evangelical christianity104 in an unnamed religious magazine he stated one day in fort bliss a neighbor called and asked if i would like to go to church with him i accepted because i wanted to see if the american church was just a country club as id been led to expect instead i found a small white frame building in the hot texas sun on a brownedgrass lot together these people make a live vibrant community this was the first time i really understood that religion was not a cathedral inherited from the past or a quick prayer at the last minute to be effective a religion has to be backed up by discipline and effort1 229230 on the motives behind this conversion michael j neufeld is of the opinion that he turned to religion to pacify his own conscience105 and university of southampton scholar kendrick oliver said that von braun was presumably moved by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the third reich106 having concluded one bad bargain with the devil perhaps now he felt a need to have god securely at his side107 at a gideons conference in 2004 w albert wilson a former pilot and nasa employee stated that he had talked with von braun about the christian faith while von braun was working for nasa and believed that conversation had been instrumental in von brauns conversion108 later in life he joined an episcopal congregation104 and became increasingly religious109 he publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of science and religion the afterlife of the soul and his belief in god110111 he stated through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation through religion he seeks to know the creator112 he was interviewed by the assemblies of god pastor c m ward and stated that the farther we probe into space the greater my faith113 in addition he met privately with evangelist billy graham and with the civil rights leader martin luther king jr114 von braun developed and published his space station concept during the time of the cold war when the us government put the containment of the soviet union above everything else the fact that his space station if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time would give the united states space superiority in both orbital and orbittoground warfare did not escape him in his popular writings von braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles but he took care to qualify such military applications as particularly dreadful this muchlesspeaceful aspect of von brauns drive for space has been reviewed by michael j neufeld from the space history division of the national air and space museum in washington115 the us navy had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit but the resulting vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable in 1957 with the launch of sputnik 1 a belief grew within the united states that it lagged behind the soviet union in the emerging space race american authorities then chose to use von braun and his german teams experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle von braun had originally proposed such an idea in 1954 but it was denied at the time86 nasa was established by law on 29 july 1958 one day later the 50th redstone rocket was successfully launched from johnston atoll in the south pacific as part of operation hardtack i two years later nasa opened the marshall space flight center at redstone arsenal in huntsville and the army ballistic missile agency abma development team led by von braun was transferred to nasa in a facetoface meeting with herb york at the pentagon von braun made it clear he would go to nasa only if development of the saturn were allowed to continue116 von braun became the centers first director on 1 july 1960 and held the position until 27 january 1970117 von brauns early years at nasa included a failed 4 inch mission on 21 november 1960 during which the first uncrewed mercuryredstone rocket the rocket only rose up a mere 4 inches before settling back down onto the launch pad the unfortunate and untimely failure of the rocket launch created a nadir of morale in project mercury the launch failure was later determined to be the result of a power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker failed it to make it fitcitation needed because of the difference in the length of one prong the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a cutoff signal to the engine the safety system in fact stopped the launch118 after the success of the mercuryredstone 2 mission in january 1961 a mere 2 months after the failed 4 inch mission nasa morale was improved still a new string of problems emerged von braun insisted on one more test before the redstone could be deemed manrated his overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program who argued that mr2s technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight he overruled them so a test mission involving a redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in march von brauns stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the us to launch a crewed space mission before the soviet union which ended up putting the first man in space the following month119 three weeks later on 5 may von brauns team successfully launched alan shepard into space he named his mercuryredstone 3 freedom 7120 the marshall centers first major program was the development of saturn rockets to carry heavy payloads into and beyond earth orbit from this the apollo program for crewed moon flights was developed von braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an earth orbit rendezvous technique the approach he had argued for building his space station but in 1962 he converted to the lunar orbit rendezvous concept that was subsequently realized121122 during apollo he worked closely with former peenemnde teammate kurt h debus the first director of the kennedy space center his dream to help mankind set foot on the moon became a reality on 16 july 1969 when a marshalldeveloped saturn v rocket launched the crew of apollo 11 on its historic eightday mission over the course of the program saturn v rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the moon123 during the late 1960s von braun was instrumental in the development of the us space and rocket center in huntsville the desk from which he guided americas entry into the space race remains on display there he also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental applications technology satellite he traveled to india and hoped that the program would be helpful in bringing a massive educational television project to help the poorest people in that country124 during the local summer of 196667 von braun participated in a field trip to antarctica organized for him and several other members of top nasa management125 the goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by the us scientific and technological community during the exploration of antarctic wastelands would be useful for the crewed exploration of space von braun was mainly interested in the management of the scientific effort on antarctic research stations logistics habitation and life support and in using the barren antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day was used to look for signs of life on mars and other worlds126 in an internal memo dated 16 january 1969127 von braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at huntsville to head the apollo applications program he referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray stating i certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial apollo flights128 a few months later on the occasion of the first moon landing he publicly expressed his optimism that the saturn v carrier system would continue to be developed advocating human missions to mars in the 1980s129 nonetheless on 1 march 1970 von braun and his family relocated to washington dc when he was assigned the post of nasas deputy associate administrator for planning at nasa headquarters after a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the apollo program and facing severe budget constraints von braun retired from nasa on 26 may 1972 not only had it become evident by this time that nasa and his visions for future us space flight projects were incompatible but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the moon had been accomplished130 von braun also developed the idea of a space camp that would train children in fields of science and space technologies as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development29 354355 131 after leaving nasa von braun moved to the washington dc area and became vice president for engineering and development at the aerospace company fairchild industries in germantown maryland on 1 july 1972131 in 1973 during a routine physical examination von braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time132 von braun helped establish and promote the national space institute a precursor of the presentday national space society in 1975 and became its first president and chairman in 1976 he became a scientific consultant to lutz kayser the ceo of otrag and a member of the daimlerbenz board of directors however his deteriorating health forced him to retire from fairchild on 31 december 1976 when the 1975 national medal of science was awarded to him in early 1977 he had been hospitalized and was unable to attend the white house ceremony133 von brauns insistence on more tests after mercuryredstone 2 flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the soviet unions success in launching the first human in space134 the successful mercuryredstone bd flight took the launch slot that might have put alan shepard into space three weeks ahead of yuri gagarin his soviet counterpart sergei korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking gagarins life on a crewed attempt the second test flight took place one day after the mercuryredstone bd mission29 von braun took a conservative approach to engineering designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure this became a point of contention with other engineers who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized as noted above his caution likely led to the us losing the race to put a man into space before the soviets krafft ehricke likened von brauns approach to building the brooklyn bridge135 208 many at nasa headquarters jokingly referred to marshall as the chicago bridge and iron works but acknowledged that the designs worked136 the conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the saturn c4 producing the saturn v the c4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine29 371 von braun did not indicate interest in politics or political philosophy during his onboarding working for the us army he was primarily focused on his work in guided missiles for the purpose of advancing science and technology according to fbi background checks any political activity he may have engaged in was a means to an end to provide him with the necessary freedom to conduct his experiments33 this included time spent in the nazi party during world war 2 during his time in nasa he opposed racial segregation which brought him into conflict with george wallace who advocated racial discrimination in alabama and wanted to continue segregation137 von braun accused segregationist policies as obstructing the development of alabama his statements were considered unusual for a space scientist particularly in the south but well within agency and national policy138 von braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies man as a student in berlin he often was seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once29 63 he later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and computer pool at peenemnde29 9294 in january 1943 von braun became engaged to dorothee brill a physical education teacher in berlin and he sought permission to marry from the ss race and settlement main office however the engagement was broken due to his mothers opposition29 146147 later in 1943 he had an affair with a french woman while in paris preparing v2 launch sites in northeastern france she was imprisoned for collaboration after the war and became destitute29 147148 during his stay at fort bliss von braun proposed marriage to maria luise von quistorp 10 june 1928 20 january 2025139 his maternal first cousin in a letter to his father he married her in a lutheran church in landshut bavaria on 1 march 1947 having received permission to go back to germany and return with his wife he was 35 and his new bride was 18140 shortly after he converted to evangelicalism141 he returned to manhattan on 26 march 1947 with his wife father and mother on 8 december 1948 the von brauns first daughter together iris careen was born at fort bliss army hospital45 the couple had two more children margrit ccile born in 1952142 and peter constantine born in 1960142 on 15 april 1955 von braun became a naturalized citizen of the united states143 in 1973 von braun was diagnosed with kidney cancer during a routine medical examination however he continued to work unrestrained for a number of years in 1975 president gerald r ford awarded him the countrys highest science honor the national medal of science in engineering he was too ill to attend the white house ceremony144 in january 1977 then very ill he resigned from fairchild industries von braun died on 16 june 1977 of pancreatic cancer in alexandria virginia at age 65145146 he is buried on valley road at the ivy hill cemetery in alexandria his gravestone cites psalm 191 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork kjv147 left ss after graduation from the school commissioned in 1940 with date of entry backdated to 1934 von braun has been featured in a number of films and television shows or series several fictional characters have been modeled on von braun print media literature theatre music video games
