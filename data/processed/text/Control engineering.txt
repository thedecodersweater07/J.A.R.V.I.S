control engineering also known as control systems engineering and in some european countries automation engineering is an engineering discipline that deals with control systems applying control theory to design equipment and systems with desired behaviors in control environments1 the discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering chemical engineering and mechanical engineering at many institutions around the world1 the practice uses sensors and detectors to measure the output performance of the process being controlled these measurements are used to provide corrective feedback helping to achieve the desired performance systems designed to perform without requiring human input are called automatic control systems such as cruise control for regulating the speed of a car multidisciplinary in nature control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of a diverse range of systems2 modern day control engineering is a relatively new field of study that gained significant attention during the 20th century with the advancement of technology it can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of control theory control engineering plays an essential role in a wide range of control systems from simple household washing machines to highperformance fighter aircraft it seeks to understand physical systems using mathematical modelling in terms of inputs outputs and various components with different behaviors to use control system design tools to develop controllers for those systems and to implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology a system can be mechanical electrical fluid chemical financial or biological and its mathematical modelling analysis and controller design uses control theory in one or many of the time frequency and complexs domains depending on the nature of the design problem control engineering is the engineering discipline that focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems eg mechanical systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner3 6 although such controllers need not be electrical many are and hence control engineering is often viewed as a subfield of electrical engineering electrical circuits digital signal processors and microcontrollers can all be used to implement control systems control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles in most cases control engineers utilize feedback when designing control systems this is often accomplished using a proportionalintegralderivative controller pid controller system for example in an automobile with cruise control the vehicles speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motors torque accordingly where there is regular feedback control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback in practically all such systems stability is important and control theory can help ensure stability is achieved although feedback is an important aspect of control engineering control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback this is known as open loop control a classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that runs through a predetermined cycle without the use of sensors automatic control systems were first developed over two thousand years ago the first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient ktesibioss water clock in alexandria egypt around the third century bce it kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and therefore the water flow from that vessel 3 22 this certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in baghdad when the mongols captured the city in 1258 ce a variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply just to entertain the latter includes the automata popular in europe in the 17th and 18th centuries featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again these automata are examples of openloop control milestones among feedback or closedloop automatic control devices include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to drebbel circa 1620 and the centrifugal flyball governor used for regulating the speed of steam engines by james watt3 22 in 1788 in his 1868 paper on governors james clerk maxwell was able to explain instabilities exhibited by the flyball governor using differential equations to describe the control system this demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena and it signaled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in maxwells analysis control theory made significant strides over the next century new mathematical techniques as well as advances in electronic and computer technologies made it possible to control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original flyball governor could stabilize new mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic robust adaptive nonlinear control methods in the 1970s and 1980s applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites safer and more efficient aircraft cleaner automobile engines and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes before it emerged as a unique discipline control engineering was practiced as a part of mechanical engineering and control theory was studied as a part of electrical engineering since electrical circuits can often be easily described using control theory techniques in the first control relationships a current output was represented by a voltage control input however not having adequate technology to implement electrical control systems designers were left with the option of less efficient and slow responding mechanical systems a very effective mechanical controller that is still widely used in some hydro plants is the governor later on previous to modern power electronics process control systems for industrial applications were devised by mechanical engineers using pneumatic and hydraulic control devices many of which are still in use today david quinn mayne 19302024 was among the early developers of a rigorous mathematical method for analysing model predictive control algorithms mpc it is currently used in tens of thousands of applications and is a core part of the advanced control technology by hundreds of process control producers mpcs major strength is its capacity to deal with nonlinearities and hard constraints in a simple and intuitive fashion his work underpins a class of algorithms that are probably correct heuristically explainable and yield control system designs which meet practically important objectives4 a control system manages commands directs or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops it can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines the control systems are designed via control engineering process for continuously modulated control a feedback controller is used to automatically control a process or operation the control system compares the value or status of the process variable pv being controlled with the desired value or setpoint sp and applies the difference as a control signal to bring the process variable output of the plant to the same value as the setpoint control theory is a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems the objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state while minimizing any delay overshoot or steadystate error and ensuring a level of control stability often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality to do this a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required this controller monitors the controlled process variable pv and compares it with the reference or set point sp the difference between actual and desired value of the process variable called the error signal or sppv error is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point other aspects which are also studied are controllability and observability control theory is used in control system engineering to design automation that have revolutionized manufacturing aircraft communications and other industries and created new fields such as robotics extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram in it the transfer function also known as the system function or network function is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system control theory dates from the 19th century when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by james clerk maxwell5 control theory was further advanced by edward routh in 1874 charles sturm and in 1895 adolf hurwitz who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria and from 1922 onwards the development of pid control theory by nicolas minorsky6 at many universities around the world control engineering courses are taught primarily in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering but some courses can be instructed in mechatronics engineering8 and aerospace engineering in others control engineering is connected to computer science as most control techniques today are implemented through computers often as embedded systems as in the automotive field the field of control within chemical engineering is often known as process control it deals primarily with the control of variables in a chemical process in a plant it is taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of any chemical engineering program and employs many of the same principles in control engineering other engineering disciplines also overlap with control engineering as it can be applied to any system for which a suitable model can be derived however specialised control engineering departments do exist for example in italy there are several master in automation robotics that are fully specialised in control engineering or the department of automatic control and systems engineering at the university of sheffield 9 or the department of robotics and control engineering at the united states naval academy10 and the department of control and automation engineering at the istanbul technical university11 control engineering has diversified applications that include science finance management and even human behavior students of control engineering may start with a linear control system course dealing with the time and complexs domain which requires a thorough background in elementary mathematics and laplace transform called classical control theory in linear control the student does frequency and time domain analysis digital control and nonlinear control courses require z transformation and algebra respectively and could be said to complete a basic control education a control engineers career starts with a bachelors degree and can continue through the college process control engineer degrees are typically paired with an electrical or mechanical engineering degree but can also be paired with a degree in chemical engineering according to a control engineering survey most of the people who answered were control engineers in various forms of their own career12 there are not very many careers that are classified as control engineer most of them are specific careers that have a small semblance to the overarching career of control engineering a majority of the control engineers that took the survey in 2019 are system or product designers or even control or instrument engineers most of the jobs involve process engineering or production or even maintenance they are some variation of control engineering12 because of this there are many job opportunities in aerospace companies manufacturing companies automobile companies power companies chemical companies petroleum companies and government agencies some places that hire control engineers include companies such as rockwell automation nasa ford phillips 66 eastman and goodrich13 control engineers can possibly earn 66k annually from lockheed martin corp they can also earn up to 96k annually from general motors corporation14 process control engineers typically found in refineries and specialty chemical plants can earn upwards of 90k annuallycitation needed in india control system engineering is provided at different levels with a diploma graduation and postgraduation these programs require the candidate to have chosen physics chemistry and mathematics for their secondary schooling or relevant bachelors degree for postgraduate studies15 originally control engineering was all about continuous systems development of computer control tools posed a requirement of discrete control system engineering because the communications between the computerbased digital controller and the physical system are governed by a computer clock3 23 the equivalent to laplace transform in the discrete domain is the ztransform today many of the control systems are computer controlled and they consist of both digital and analog components therefore at the design stage either the first of these two methods is more commonly encountered in practice because many industrial systems have many continuous systems components including mechanical fluid biological and analog electrical components with a few digital controllers similarly the design technique has progressed from paperandruler based manual design to computeraided design and now to computerautomated design or cad which has been made possible by evolutionary computation cad can be applied not just to tuning a predefined control scheme but also to controller structure optimisation system identification and invention of novel control systems based purely upon a performance requirement independent of any specific control scheme1617 resilient control systems extend the traditional focus of addressing only planned disturbances to frameworks and attempt to address multiple types of unexpected disturbance in particular adapting and transforming behaviors of the control system in response to malicious actors abnormal failure modes undesirable human action etc18
