modern dance is a broad genre of western concert or theatrical dance which includes dance styles such as ballet folk ethnic religious and social dancing and primarily arose out of europe and the united states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was considered to have been developed as a rejection of or rebellion against classical ballet and also a way to express social concerns like socioeconomic and cultural factors123 in the late 19th century modern dance artists such as isadora duncan maud allan and loie fuller were pioneering new forms and practices in what is now called improvisational or free dance these dancers disregarded ballets strict movement vocabulary the particular limited set of movements that were considered proper to ballet and stopped wearing corsets and pointe shoes in the search for greater freedom of movement3 throughout the 20th century sociopolitical concerns major historical events and the development of other art forms contributed to the continued development of modern dance in the united states and europe moving into the 1960s new ideas about dance began to emerge as a response to earlier dance forms and to social changes eventually postmodern dance artists would reject the formalism of modern dance and include elements such as performance art contact improvisation release technique and improvisation34 american modern dance can be divided roughly into three periods or eras in the early modern period c 18801923 characterized by the work of isadora duncan loie fuller ruth st denis ted shawn and eleanor king artistic practice changed radically but clearly distinct modern dance techniques had not yet emerged in the central modern period c 19231946 choreographers martha graham doris humphrey katherine dunham charles weidman and lester horton sought to develop distinctively american movement styles and vocabularies and developed clearly defined and recognizable dance training systems in the late modern period c 19461957 jos limn pearl primus merce cunningham talley beatty erick hawkins anna sokolow anna halprin and paul taylor introduced clear abstractionism and avantgarde movements and paved the way for postmodern dance5 modern dance has evolved with each subsequent generation of participating artists artistic content has morphed and shifted from one choreographer to another as have styles and techniques artists such as graham and horton developed techniques in the central modern period that are still taught worldwide and numerous other types of modern dance exist today12 modern dance is often considered to have emerged as a rejection of or rebellion against classical ballet although historians have suggested that socioeconomic changes in both the united states and europe helped to initiate shifts in the dance world in america increasing industrialization the rise of a middle class which had more disposable income and free time and the decline of victorian social strictures led to among other changes a new interest in health and physical fitness6 it was in this atmosphere that a new dance was emerging as much from a rejection of social structures as from a dissatisfaction with ballet7 during that same period the champions of physical education helped to prepare the way for modern dance and gymnastic exercises served as technical starting points for young women who longed to dance8 womens colleges began offering aesthetic dance courses by the end of the 1880s9 emil rath who wrote at length about this emerging art form at the time stated music and rhythmic bodily movement are twin sisters of art as they have come into existence simultaneouslytoday we see in the artistic work of isadora duncan maud allan and others the use of a form of dancing which strives to portray in movements what the music master expresses in his compositionsinterpretative dancing10 in europe mary wigman in germany francois delsarte mile jaquesdalcroze eurhythmics and rudolf laban developed theories of human movement and expression and methods of instruction that led to the development of european modern and expressionist dance other pioneers included kurt jooss ausdruckstanz and harald kreutzberg12 disturbed by the great depression and the rising threat of fascism in europe the radical dancers tried to raise consciousness by dramatizing the economic social ethnic and political crises of their time in 1915 ruth st denis founded the denishawn school and dance company with her husband ted shawn19 martha graham doris humphrey and charles weidman were pupils at the school and members of the dance company seeking a wider and more accepting audience for their work duncan fuller and ruth st denis toured europe martha graham is often regarded as the founding mother of modern 20thcentury concert dance20 graham viewed ballet as too onesided european imperialistic and unamerican21 she became a student at the denishawn school in 1916 and then moved to new york city in 1923 where she performed in musical comedies music halls and worked on her own choreography22 graham developed her own dance technique graham technique that hinged on concepts of contraction and release20 in grahams teachings she wanted her students to feel to feel means having a heightened sense of awareness of being grounded to the floor while at the same time feeling the energy throughout your entire body extending it to the audience23 her principal contributions to dance are the focus of the center of the body as contrast to ballets emphasis on limbs coordination between breathing and movement and a dancers relationship with the floor22 in 1927 newspapers regularly began assigning dance critics such as walter terry and edwin denby who approached performances from the viewpoint of a movement specialist rather than as a reviewer of music or drama educators accepted modern dance into college and university curricula first as a part of physical education then as performing art many college teachers were trained at the bennington summer school of the dance established at bennington college in 1934 of the bennington program agnes de mille wrote there was a fine commingling of all kinds of artists musicians and designers and secondly because all those responsible for booking the college concert series across the continent were assembled there free from the limiting strictures of the three big monopolistic managements who pressed for preference of their european clients as a consequence for the first time american dancers were hired to tour america nationwide and this marked the beginning of their solvency24 african american dance blended modern dance with african and caribbean movement flexible torso and spine articulated pelvis isolation of the limbs and polyrhythmic movement katherine dunham trained in ballet founded ballet negre in 1936 and then the katherine dunham dance company based in chicago in 1945 she opened a school in new york teaching katherine dunham technique african and caribbean movement integrated with ballet and modern dance2526 taking inspiration from africanbased dance where one part of the body plays against one another she focused on articulating the torso in her choreography pearl primus drew on african and caribbean dances to create strong dramatic works characterized by large leaps she often based her dances on the work of black writers and on racial issues such as langston hughess 1944 the negro speaks of rivers and lewis allans 1945 strange fruit 1945 her dance company developed into the pearl primus dance language institute27 alvin ailey studied under lester horton bella lewitzky and later martha graham he spent several years working in both concert and theater dance in 1958 ailey and a group of young africanamerican dancers performed as the alvin ailey american dance theater in new york he drew upon his blood memories of texas the blues spirituals and gospel as inspiration his most popular and critically acclaimed work is revelations 1960282930 the legacy of modern dance can be seen in lineage of 20thcentury concert dance forms although often producing divergent dance forms many seminal dance artists share a common heritage that can be traced back to free dance postmodern dance developed in the 1960s in united states when society questioned truths and ideologies in politics and art this period was marked by social and cultural experimentation in the arts choreographers no longer created specific schools or styles the influences from different periods of dance became more vague and fragmented20 contemporary dance emerged in the 1950s as the dance form that is combining the modern dance elements and the classical ballet elements31 it can use elements from nonwestern dance cultures such as african dancing with bent knees as a characteristic trait and butoh japanese contemporary dancing that developed in the 1950s2032 it incorporates modern european influences via the work of pioneers like isadora duncan33 according to treva bedinghaus modern dancers use dancing to express their innermost emotions often to get closer to their innerselves before attempting to choreograph a routine the modern dancer decides which emotions to try to convey to the audience many modern dancers choose a subject near and dear to their hearts such as a lost love or a personal failure the dancer will choose music that relates to the story they wish to tell or choose to use no music at all and then choose a costume to reflect their chosen emotions34 this list illustrates
