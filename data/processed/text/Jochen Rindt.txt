team he moved to brabham for 1968 and then lotus in 1969 it was at lotus that rindt found a competitive car although he was often concerned about the safety of the notoriously unreliable lotus vehicles he won his first formula one race at the 1969 united states grand prix he had a very successful 1970 season mainly racing the revolutionary lotus 72 and won five of the first nine races in practice for the italian grand prix at monza he spun into the guardrails after a failure on his cars brake shaft and a poorly installed crash barrier gave way rindt was pronounced dead while on the

his wife nina and a daughter natasha overall he competed in 62 grands prix winning six and achieving 13 podium finishes he was also successful in sports car racing winning the 1965 24 hours of le mans paired with masten gregory in a ferrari 250lm rindt was a popular figure in austria and his success resulted in increased interest in motorsport and formula one in particular he hosted a monthly television show titled motorama and set up a successful exhibition of racing cars in vienna during his time in formula one he was involved alongside jackie stewart in a campaign to improve safety in formula one jochen rindt was born on 18 april 1942 in mainz germany to an austrian mother and german father2 his mother had been a successful tennis player in her youth and like her father studied law3 rindts parents owned a spice mill in mainz which he later inherited1 they were killed in a bombing raid in hamburg during the second world war2 when he was 15 months old after which he was raised by his grandparents in graz austria4 although his grandfather chose to retain rindts german citizenship for his entire career he drove under an austrian racing licence1 in an interview he described his heritage as a terrible mixture and when asked if he felt more austrian or german said that he felt like a european5 rindt had one halfbrother uwe through his mother3 rindts childhood friends and his brother described him as a laddish child who often performed tricks to amuse others while on a skiing holiday he broke his femoral neck leading to several surgeries that left one leg four centimetres 16 in shorter than the other as a result of this rindt limped slightly for the rest of his life3 at the age of sixteen he received a moped and started racing his friends on motocross tracks5 his time in school was troubled and he was excluded from schools several times6 he said in the end i got thrown out and went to england to learn english i learned to drive while i was in england but i was too young to get a licence when i went back home i broke my leg skiing but i decided i was more than capable of driving myself even though i had one leg in plaster i actually drove without a licence for 18 months and then got caught the day before i was eligible to collect it4 his chances of obtaining a licence were put into further jeopardy because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth3 in 1960 he received his first car an old volkswagen beetle7 his interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the 1961 german grand prix at the nrburgring with school friends including fellow future formula one driver helmut marko89 rindt drove his first race at the flugplatzrennen in 1961 in his grandmothers simca montlhry10 after missing the official application period he only entered after a friendly highranking motorsport functionary from graz intervened on his behalf9 during the race he was black flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified he did not immediately return to the pit lane as he was unaware of the regulations rindt entered several rallies with his simca but did not achieve good results it was only when he was provided with a raceprepared alfa romeo gt 1300clarify at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful in the alfa romeo he achieved eight victories38 in 1963 rindt switched to formula junior with the assistance of kurt bardibarry a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of austrias leading drivers at the time barry gave him his oneyearold cooper t678 and the two men formed a partnership driving to races together rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in vallelunga a race won by barry and took victory in his second at cesenatico in the race rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages while most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead at the time he was notorious for his dangerous style almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of budapest11 rindt was highly successful in formula two racing amassing a total of 29 victories5 he once again entered the series in partnership with barry driving brabham cars the engines provided by cosworth were slower and inconsistent in performance rindt responded to his reduced pace by declaring then i just brake two metres later3 he entered his first f2 race in april 1964 at the preis von wien at aspern retiring from both heats12 the international motor racing world first took notice of him on 18 may 1964 when rindt won the london trophy race at the crystal palace circuit in a brabham bt10 ahead of graham hill1314 like many other drivers at the time rindt continued to race in formula two races alongside his duties in formula one his last f2 appearance was the festspielpreis der salzburg in august 197015 in 1967 he dominated formula two winning nine races in his brabham bt23 as an experienced formula one driver he was graded a meaning his results did not count towards the championship16 and the title went to jacky ickx3 still his performances led him to be called king of formula 2 by the racing press he had a longstanding relationship with roy winkelmann and drove with his team until it closed at the end of 196913 along with singleseater racing rindt took up sports car racing in the mid1960s rindt started at the 24 hours of le mans a total of four times at his debut in 1964 sharing a ferrari 250lm with david piper the car retired too early for rindt even to take the wheel17 rindts best result came the following year at the 1965 24 hours of le mans sharing the drive of a ferrari 250lm with american masten gregory for the north american racing team rindt won the event neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car a 1998 article in motor sport stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race but instead it was more a case of hope it breaks soon so they could draw their money and split18 at the start the drivers had to run to their cars rindt entered with a forward roll that allowed him to get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead19 the pair experienced considerable trouble in the early part of the race the car did not restart during gregorys first pit stop later the engine failed partially and gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders18 at this point rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes expecting their race to be over20 after thirty minutes of repairs the car restarted and rindt and gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event flat out at full speed and with the accompanying risk18 rindt drove most of the night advancing from 18th to third position by dawn5 gregory persuaded rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse the car to the finish20 jacky ickx later recalled that the two had driven like maniacs even so the car survived handing the pair what ickx called an unexpected victory521 later that year rindt drove again in a ferrari 250lm at the 500 kilometre race at zeltweg he was able to win ahead of the better powered ferrari of mike parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights using the tool shortly before his actual braking point rindt was able to force parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead3 apart from his 1965 victory he never finished the race in le mans in 1966 his ford gt40 shared with innes ireland suffered an engine failure22 a year later he drove a porsche 907 with gerhard mitter until their camshaft failed23 rindt made his formula one debut at his home race the 1964 austrian grand prix in a loaned brabham bt11 supplied by the rob walker racing team he retired on the 58th lap with a broken steering column in his only grand prix of the season524 for the 1965 formula one season rindt signed as a permanent driver with cooper paired with bruce mclaren he was not immediately successful as cooper formerly a top team were struggling at the time in his first race the 1965 south african grand prix he developed transistor trouble the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and rindt had to retire from the race25 his best result was a fourth place at the german grand prix at the nrburgring13 he ended the season with four points 13th in the championship26 for 1966 cooper introduced the t81 chassis and used nineyear old maserati v12 engines which were powerful but heavy a new engine formula was introduced for the season with the capacity doubled to three litres27 many teams struggled with the new rules leaving cooper competitive even with their old maserati v12s after mclaren left rindt became team leader until 1964 world champion john surtees joined from ferrari13 at the second race of the year the belgian grand prix rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second next to surtees on the front row of the grid in a race affected by heavy rain he overtook surtees for the lead on lap four he spun several times on the wet track and suffered from a limitedslip differential but held onto the lead until lap 21 when surtees repassed him and won it was rindts first ever podium finish in formula one after what motor sport magazine called a very courageous drive28 overall he achieved three podium positions handing him third place in the championship at the end of the year529 1967 was less successful as rindt only finished two races the belgian and italian grands prix both in fourth place13 six points meant that he ended the season in 13th place in the championship30 prior to 1968 rindt received offers from every team except lotus and honda3 and moved to brabham who had been world champions in the two previous seasons technical problems restricted him that year brabhams repco v8 engine was not competitive against the now widely used cosworth dfv13 and rindt finished just two races both in third place at the season opener in south africa on new years day rindt placed third being elevated by a late retirement from jackie stewart and closing on secondplaced graham hill towards the end31 the race was won by jim clark a close friend of rindts it was clarks final formula one race he died three months later at a formula two race at hockenheim32 rindt was deeply affected by his death telling austrian journalist heinz prller if jim clark is not safe what can happen to us5 his second podium finish came in heavy rain and fog at the nrburgring at the german grand prix a race dominated by stewart who finished four minutes ahead of hill in second place rindt had closed on hill in the latter stages of the race after the englishman spun and finished just four seconds behind after a close battle during the last lap3334 his eight points placed him twelfth in the championship at the end of the season35 during these years he also raced in the indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968 but finished only 24th and 32nd3637 completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of the 1967 race after dropping out of the 1967 race rindt was interviewed on the radio network by luke walton when asked what he thought of the 500 he said not much38 in an interview in 2014 heinz prller recalled rindt speaking about indianapolis in 1967 in indianapolis i always feel like i am on my way to my own funeral39 at another occasion he said about the track it is catastrophic i only drive there because of the money19 for the 1969 season rindt signed for the 1968 world constructors champion lotus where he joined the defending drivers champion graham hill rindt felt uncomfortable with the move owing to the notorious unreliability of the lotus car in a twentymonth period between 1967 and 1969 the team was involved in 31 accidents hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970 which led him to joke every time i am being overtaken by my own wheel i know i am in a lotus40 when rindt joined lotus his friend and de facto manager bernie ecclestone who had negotiated the deal remarked that they were aware that brabham may have been a better choice of team but the speed of the lotus gave rindt a chance to win the championship5 rindt commented at lotus i can either be world champion or die4142 because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team rindt did not sign the lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 spanish grand prix5 rindts hesitancy appeared justified when both he and hill suffered high speed crashes at the spanish grand prix at montjuc in both instances the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off causing accidents that could have killed either driver the effect of the failure lifted rindts car off the track and into the barriers where it collided with the stationary car of hill whose accident occurred at the same spot43 although rindt only suffered a broken nose one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken rindt was furious with lotuss team owner colin chapman over the failure he told a reporter after the accident i place the blame on him chapman and rightfully so because he should have calculated that the wing would break in an interview on austrian television a day later he said these wings are insanity ein wahnsinn in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars but to get any wisdom into colin chapmans head is impossible asked whether he had lost trust in lotus after the accident he replied i never had any trust in lotus going on to describe his relationship with the team as purely business35 his accident left him sidelined for the monaco grand prix a race that hill won44 jackie stewart later described rindts 1969 season as the year that he came of age3 at the end of the year motor sport magazine called him the only driver to challenge stewart seriously throughout the season albeit placing only fourth in the championship the poor reliability of the lotus 49b affected him he retired from seven races45 at the british grand prix rindt fought a close battle with stewart for the lead both men were 90 seconds ahead of thirdplaced jacky ickx the race was decided in stewarts favour only when rindt had to enter the pits after part of his cars bodywork started to rub on the tyre he finished fourth46 at the italian grand prix he was involved in a memorable finish having started from pole position he traded the lead with stewart and piers courage several times during the last lap rindt stewart mclaren and jeanpierre beltoise were running close together as they approached the finish line stewart took the win only eight hundredths of a second ahead of rindt while fourth placed mclaren was also within two tenths of a second it was the closest 1234 finish in the history of the sport47 rindt recorded his maiden grand prix win at the penultimate race of the season at watkins glen winning 50000the largest monetary prize in formula one history at the time3 his victory was overshadowed by a serious accident involving his teammate hill who crashed after a high speed puncture and suffered major leg injuries48 for 1970 rindts partner at lotus was john miles graham hill had left the team to drive for rob walkers customer franchise rindt became the clear team leader49 at the first grand prix of the season in south africa he qualified fourth but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with chris amon and jack brabham the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career50 at the following race the spanish grand prix lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design instead of one conventional front radiator the lotus 72 featured two one on each side of the cockpit further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coilsprings and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight51 during its first practice session the left semiaxle of the car broke sending rindt into a spin3 the car also proved ineffective in the race rindt retired after nine laps51 as the lotus 72 was not as effective as the team hoped it was returned to the factory to be rebuilt and rindt used the old lotus 49 for the next race in monaco the necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable seemingly unaffected by this rindt produced what his race engineer herbie blash called the race of his life from eighth on the grid he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities in the closing stages he was second steadily closing the gap on leader jack brabham on the final lap on the final corner brabham braked too late touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales allowing rindt through to take his first victory of the season rindt used the lotus 49 one last time at the belgian grand prix a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them5 he had originally started practice in the remodelled 72 but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone forcing rindt to switch cars once more despite engine troubles during the rest of practice he managed to qualify on the front row but later retired with another engine failure52 at the dutch grand prix rindt eventually used the new lotus 72 better sorted after alterations had been made he set pole position in the final practice session almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger stewart53 rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the lotus 72 but it was not a joyful occasion for him on lap 23 his close friend piers courage with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before died in a fiery crash rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement54 after the success at zandvoort rindt gained confidence in the new lotus 72 describing it as the best racing car that exists at the moment3 but he continued to have problems during practice for the french grand prix rindt opted to drop his new allenveloping bellstar crash helmet finding it too hot he went back to using his openfront helmet only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car causing a deep cut on his right cheek55 he also suffered a steering failure on his car furious over yet another mechanical problem he stormed into the lotus garage and yelled at colin chapman if this happens again and i survive i will kill all of you3 rindt was still able to win the race taking the lead in the championship55 the next race was the british grand prix at brands hatch jacky ickx established an early lead ahead of brabham and rindt but when ickxs transmission failed rindt seized the opportunity to pass brabham for the lead brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner only to repeat his misfortune of monaco on the last lap he ran out of fuel allowing rindt to take his third win in a row his victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when chief scrutineer cecil mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height rindt was provisionally disqualified only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation356 the german grand prix was originally set to take place at its traditional venue the nrburgring the grand prix drivers association gpda represented by rindt and graham hill demanded changes to the circuit to increase safety including armco barriers along the entire 228 kilometres 142 mi of the nordschleife no agreement was reached and the grand prix moved to hockenheim where rindt took his fourth victory in succession the race was another twoway fight this time between rindt and ickx who exchanged the lead several times5 this meant that he could have secured the drivers title at his home event at the austrian grand prix he set the lotus 72 on pole position to the delight of the crowd but retired from the race with an engine failure57 the title decision was therefore postponed to the next race in monza3 the paddock moved to the italian grand prix at monza a track known for high speeds drivers often used the slipstream of cars in front to increase their pace because of this many teams including lotus opted to remove the rear wings mounted on the cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds the more powerful flat12 ferraris of jacky ickx and clay regazzoni had been up to 16 kmh 10 mph faster than the lotus at the previous race in austria rindts teammate john miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in friday practice reporting that the car wouldnt run straight rindt reported no such problems and chapman recalled that rindt reported the car to be almost 800 rpm faster on the straight without wings58 on the following day 5 september 197059 rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag increasing the cars potential top speed to 330 kmh 205 mph60 on his fifth lap of his practice session he crashed heavily at the approach to the parabolica corner denny hulme who was following rindt at the time described the accident as follows jochen was following me for several laps and slowly catching me up and i didnt go through the second lesmo corner very quick so i pulled to the one side and let jochen past me and then i followed him down into the parabolica we were going very fast and he waited until about the 200 metres to put on the brakes the car just sort of went to the right and then it turned to the left and turned out to the right again and then suddenly just went very quickly left into the guardrail5 upon impact a joint in the crash barrier parted the suspension of the vehicle went under the barrier and the car hit a stanchion headon the front end was destroyed rindt was in the habit of using only four points on the fivepoint harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps as he wanted to be able to exit the car quickly in the event of fire as a result upon impact he slid under the belts and the belts fatally slit open rindts throat46162 later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the cars right front inboard brake shaft but that rindts death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers6344 chapman rejected the assertion that the broken brake shaft had caused the accident arguing that the shaft broke when the wheel hit the crash barrier64 rindt was pronounced dead on the way to hospital in milan and lotus withdrew all cars from the race including the lotus 72 entered by rob walker4465 the grand prix went ahead and clay regazzoni took his maiden victory but celebrations were muted66 there was a lengthy investigation into rindts death in italy leading to a trial against colin chapman he was cleared of all charges in 1976 the destroyed lotus 72 remained in italy after the trial going to a scrapyard near monza in 1985 a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities later trading it in 1993 for a lola formula 3 car since then the car has rested in a garage near milan67 rindt was buried at the central cemetery zentralfriedhof in graz on 11 september 1970568 at his funeral joakim bonnier gave the eulogy saying to die doing something that you loved to do is to die happy and jochen has the admiration and the respect of all of us the only way you can admire and respect a great driver and friend regardless what happens in the remaining grands prix this year to all of us jochen is the world champion5 at the time he died rindt had won five of that years ten grands prix which meant that he had a substantial lead in the drivers championship after winning the next race in canada jacky ickx moved within 17 points of rindt in the championship giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races69 at the united states grand prix a race won by rindts replacement at lotus emerson fittipaldi ickx placed only fourth making rindt motor racings only posthumous world champion70 the championship trophy was handed to his widow nina by jackie stewart on 18 november 1970 in a ceremony near the place de la concorde in paris57172 rindt was commemorated in many ways the early season barc 200 formula two race was renamed the jochen rindt memorial trophy for as long as the series existed in 2000 on the 30th anniversary of his death the city of graz unveiled a bronze plaque in remembrance of rindt with wife nina and daughter natasha present44 the penultimate corner at the red bull ring in austria is named after rindt73 the historic sports car club in the united kingdom hosts a historic formula 2 championship whose pre1972 category is called the class a jochen rindt trophy74 in march 1967 rindt married nina lincoln a finnish model and daughter of racing driver curt lincoln whom he had raced in the early part of his career13 after becoming engaged lincoln had originally broken up with rindt and sent the engagement ring back rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind which she did upon receiving the package later explaining i like men who know what they want41 the couple moved to switzerland near begnins where they built a house together44 the rindts had one daughter natasha who was two years old at the time of her fathers death nina rindt married twice more after rindts death first philip martyn with whom she had another daughter and then alexander hood 4th viscount bridport making her nina hood lady bridport the couple had a son anthony75 their daughter natasha later worked with bernie ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of formula one5 rindt had met bernie ecclestone during his time at cooper and the two became friends noticing his commercial talent rindt allowed ecclestone to manage his professional contracts without ever officially employing him as a manager ecclestone said of the relationship i was never his manager we were good friends i helped him with any help he ever needed after rindts accident it was ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane5 in formula one rindt had several friendly relationships with other drivers most notably jackie stewart they met at a formula two event in 1964 and soon became friends often going on holiday together and living near each other in switzerland until his death they were sometimes accompanied by jim clark3 rindt became involved in stewarts fight for increased safety in formula one being one of the leading figures of the gpda for his role in the safety campaign rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike reporters derogatively called stewart rindt and joakim bonnier the geneva connection due to their residence in switzerland5 stewart said that it took rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that he was a good ally3 after rindts death his wife nina stayed close with the stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the 1971 monaco grand prix in the roman polanskiproduced film weekend of a champion76 privately rindt was known to family and friends as an often reckless driver when on public roads during the early years of his career he took his jaguar etype out in the streets of vienna where he lived and drifted through the streets77 he sparked public criticism in 1968 when he flipped over a mini cooper during a demonstration run at an autocross event in grohflein while his pregnant wife was on board3 rindts success popularised motorsport in austria helmut zwickl called him the driving instructor of the nation5 in 1965 rindt put together the first exhibition of racing cars in austria the jochenrindtshow in vienna it was an immediate success with 30000 visitors on the first weekend alone using his connections he brought in his friend joakim bonnier and former mercedes grand prix manager alfred neubauer as opening speakers with other drivers such as jackie stewart attending3 the show soon became an annual event and later moved to the german city of essen in 1970 shortly after rindts death and remains there as the essen motor show41 rindt with the help of ecclestone was able to successfully promote himself including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts3 following his ascent in racing two race tracks were built in austria the sterreichring now red bull ring for which rindt worked as a consultant and the salzburgring rindts popularity was further increased through the tv show motorama which he hosted the monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads reports from grands prix and interviews of fellow drivers by rindt5 key races in
