the massachusetts institute of technology mit is a private research university in cambridge massachusetts united states established in 1861 mit has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science in response to the increasing industrialization of the united states william barton rogers organized a school in boston to create useful knowledge initially funded by a federal land grant the institute adopted a polytechnic model that stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering mit moved from boston to cambridge in 1916 and grew rapidly through collaboration with private industry military branches and new federal basic research agencies the formation of which was influenced by mit faculty like vannevar bush in the late twentieth century mit became a leading center for research in computer science digital technology artificial intelligence and big science initiatives like the human genome project engineering remains its largest school though mit has also built programs in basic science social sciences business management and humanities the institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile 16 km along the charles river the campus is known for academic buildings interconnected by corridors and many significant modernist buildings mits offcampus operations include the mit lincoln laboratory and the haystack observatory as well as affiliated laboratories such as the broad and whitehead institutes the institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and mit alumni have founded or cofounded many notable companies1011 campus life is known for elaborate hacks as of october 2024update 105 nobel laureates12 26 turing award winners and 8 fields medalists have been affiliated with mit as alumni faculty members or researchers13 in addition 58 national medal of science recipients 29 national medals of technology and innovation recipients 50 macarthur fellows14 83 marshall scholars15 41 astronauts16 16 chief scientists of the us air force and 8 foreign heads of state have been affiliated with mit a school of industrial science aiding the advancement development and practical application of science in connection with arts agriculture manufactures and commerce 17 massachusetts general court acts of 1861 chapter 183 in 1859 a proposal was submitted to the massachusetts general court to use newly filled lands in back bay boston for a conservatory of art and science but the proposal failed1819 a charter for the incorporation of the massachusetts institute of technology proposed by william barton rogers was signed by john albion andrew the governor of massachusetts on april 10 186120 rogers a geologist who had recently arrived in boston from the university of virginia21 wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances2223 he did not wish to found a professional school but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education24 proposing that the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as i conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws25 the rogers plan reflected the german research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories2627 two days after mit was chartered the first battle of the civil war broke out after a long delay through the war years mits first classes were held in the mercantile building in boston in 186528 the new institute was founded as part of the morrill landgrant colleges act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was a landgrant school2930 in 1863 under the same act the commonwealth of massachusetts founded the massachusetts agricultural college which developed as the university of massachusetts amherst in 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the back bay31 mit was informally called boston tech31 the institute adopted the european polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date26 despite chronic financial problems the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under president francis amasa walker32 programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced3334 new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand32 the curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis with less focus on theoretical science35 the fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the mit leadership during these boston tech years mit faculty and alumni rebuffed harvard university president and former mit faculty charles w eliots repeated attempts to merge mit with harvard colleges lawrence scientific school36 there would be at least six attempts to absorb mit into harvard37 in its cramped back bay location mit could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding eventually the mit corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with harvard and move to allston over the vehement objections of mit faculty students and alumni37 the merger plan collapsed in 1905 when the massachusetts supreme judicial court ruled that mit could not sell its back bay land38 in 1912 mit acquired its current campus by purchasing a onemile 16 km tract of filled lands along the cambridge side of the charles river3940 the neoclassical new technology campus was designed by william w bosworth41 and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious mr smith starting in 1912 in january 1920 the donor was revealed to be the industrialist george eastman an inventor of film production methods and founder of eastman kodak between 1912 and 1920 eastman donated 20 million 3042 million in 2024 dollars in cash and kodak stock to mit42 in 1916 with the first academic buildings complete the mit administration and the mit charter crossed the charles river on the ceremonial barge bucentaur built for the occasion4344 needing funds to match eastmans gift and cover retreating state support president richard maclaurin launched an industry funding model known as the technology plan in 1920454647 as mit grew under the tech plan it built new postgraduate programs that stressed laboratory work on industry problems including a new program in electrical engineering45 gerard swope mits chairman and head of general electric believed talented engineers needed scientific research training45 in 1930 he recruited karl taylor compton to helm mits transformation as a technological research university and to build more autonomy from private industry4547 a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science engineering and the arts we might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives48 mit president james rhyne killian inaugural address 1949 in the 1930s president karl taylor compton and vicepresident effectively provost vannevar bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios49 the compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering50 unlike ivy league schools mit catered more to middleclass families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding46 still as late as 1949 the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and governmentsponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities5152 the school of humanities arts and social sciences and the mit sloan school of management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful schools of science and engineering previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs5354 humanities and social science programs continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents howard w johnson and jerome wiesner between 1966 and 198055 mits involvement in military research projects surged during world war ii in 1941 vannevar bush was appointed head of the federal office of scientific research and development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including mit56 engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at mits radiation laboratory established in 1940 to assist the british military in developing microwave radar the work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area57 other defense projects included gyroscopebased and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under charles stark drapers instrumentation laboratory5859 the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under project whirlwind60 and highspeed and highaltitude photography under harold edgerton6162 by the end of the war mit became the nations largest wartime rd contractor attracting some criticism of bush56 employing nearly 4000 in the radiation laboratory alone57 and receiving in excess of 100 million 12 billion in 2015 dollars before 194650 work on defense projects continued even after then postwar governmentsponsored research at mit included sage and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and project apollo63 these activities affected mit profoundly a 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities64 the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the presidential terms of karl taylor compton 19301948 james rhyne killian 19481957 and chancellor julius adams stratton 19521957 whose institutionbuilding strategies shaped the expanding university by the 1950s mit no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government65 in late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the vietnam war and mits defense research6667 in this period mits various departments were researching helicopters smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles68 the union of concerned scientists was founded on march 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems69 mit ultimately divested itself from the instrumentation laboratory and moved all classified research offcampus to the mit lincoln laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests7071 the student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities66 johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to greater strength and unity after these times of turmoil72 however six mit students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as michael albert and george katsiaficas are still indignant about mits role in military research and its suppression of these protests73 richard leacocks film november actions records some of these tumultuous events74 in the 1980s there was more controversy at mit over its involvement in sdi space weaponry and cbw chemical and biological warfare research75 more recently mits research for the military has included work on robots drones and battle suits76 mit has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age in addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies7778 students staff and faculty members at project mac the artificial intelligence laboratory and the tech model railroad club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like spacewar and created much of modern hacker slang and culture79 several major computerrelated organizations have originated at mit since the 1980s richard stallmans gnu project and the subsequent free software foundation were founded in the mid1980s at the ai lab the mit media lab was founded in 1985 by nicholas negroponte and jerome wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology80 the world wide web consortium standards organization was founded at the laboratory for computer science in 1994 by tim bernerslee81 the opencourseware project has made course materials for over 2000 mit classes available online free of charge since 200282 and the one laptop per child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 200583 mit was named a seagrant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a spacegrant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs8485 despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century mit launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus the tang center for management education several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology brain and cognitive sciences genomics biotechnology and cancer research and a number of new backlot buildings on vassar street including the stata center86 construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the media lab the sloan schools eastern campus and graduate residences in the northwest8788 in 2006 president hockfield launched the mit energy research council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption89 in 2001 inspired by the open source and open access movements90 mit launched opencourseware to make the lecture notes problem sets syllabi exams and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed91 while the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high92 ocw expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the opencourseware consortium which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages93 in 2011 mit announced it would offer formal certification but not credits or degrees to online participants completing coursework in its mitx program for a modest fee94 the edx online platform supporting mitx was initially developed in partnership with harvard and its analogous harvardx initiative the courseware platform is open source and other universities have already joined and added their own course content95 in march 2009 the mit faculty adopted an openaccess policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online96 mit has its own police force three days after the boston marathon bombing of april 2013 mit police patrol officer sean collier was fatally shot by the suspects dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the boston metropolitan area for a day97 one week later colliers memorial service was attended by more than 10000 people in a ceremony hosted by the mit community with thousands of police officers from the new england region and canada9899100 on november 25 2013 mit announced the creation of the collier medal to be awarded annually to an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that officer collier exhibited as a member of the mit community and in all aspects of his life the announcement further stated that future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession those who have contributed to building bridges across the community and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness101102103 in september 2017 the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the mitibm watson ai lab ibm will spend 240 million over the next decade and the lab will be staffed by mit and ibm scientists104 in october 2018 mit announced that it would open a new schwarzman college of computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence named after lead donor and the blackstone group ceo stephen schwarzman the focus of the new college is to study not just ai but interdisciplinary ai education and how ai can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology the cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be 1 billion upon completion105 the laser interferometer gravitationalwave observatory ligo was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from california institute of technology mit and industrial contractors and funded by the national science foundation it was designed to open the field of gravitationalwave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity106 gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the ligo detector in 2015 for contributions to the ligo detector and the observation of gravitational waves two caltech physicists kip thorne and barry barish and mit physicist rainer weiss won the nobel prize in physics in 2017107 weiss who is also an mit graduate designed the laser interferometric technique which served as the essential blueprint for the ligo108 in april 2024 mit students joined other campuses across the united states in protests and setting up encampments against the gaza war109110111112 student likened their actions to the historic protests against the american invasion of vietnam and mit investments in south african apartheid113 they called for ending ties to the israeli ministry of defense114 mits 166acre 672 ha campus in the city of cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the charles river basin6 the campus is divided roughly in half by massachusetts avenue with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east the bridge closest to mit is the harvard bridge which is known for being marked off in a nonstandard unit of length the smoot115116 the kendallmit mbta red line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus in kendall square the cambridge neighborhoods surrounding mit are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socioeconomically diverse residential neighborhoods117118 in early 2016 mit presented a development plan for kendall square the city of cambridge adding highrise educational retail residential startup incubator and office space around the mbta station the mit museum has moved immediately adjacent to a kendall square subway entrance joining the list visual arts center on the eastern end of the campus119 each building at mit has a number possibly preceded by a w n e or nw designation and most have a name as well typically academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name the organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative north west and east to the original center cluster of maclaurin buildings120 many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels providing protection from the cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking121122 the campus primary energy source is natural gas in connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus the institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency mit has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles subsidizing public transportation passes constructing solar power offsets and building a cogeneration plant to power campus electricity heating and cooling requirements123124 mits oncampus nuclear reactor125 is one of the most powerful universitybased nuclear reactors in the united states the prominence of the reactors containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial126 but mit maintains that it is wellsecured127 mit nano also known as building 12 is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research its 100000 sq ft 9300 m2 cleanroom and research space visible through expansive glass facades is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation128 with a cost of us400 million it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus the facility also provides stateoftheart nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5106 lb 2300000 kg slab of concrete underground129 other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs and previously alcator cmod which was the largest fusion device operated by any university130131 mits campuswide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3000 access points covering 94106 sq ft 870000 m2 of campus132 mits school of architecture founded in 1865133 and now called the school of architecture and planning was the first formal architecture program in the united states134 and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings135136 the first buildings constructed on the cambridge campus completed in 1916 are sometimes called the maclaurin buildings after institute president richard maclaurin who oversaw their construction designed by william welles bosworth these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete a first for a nonindustrial much less university building in the us137 bosworths design was influenced by the city beautiful movement of the early 1900s137 and features the pantheonesque great dome housing the barker engineering library the great dome overlooks killian court where graduation ceremonies are held each year the friezes of the limestoneclad buildings around killian court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophersa the spacious building 7 atrium at 77 massachusetts avenue is regarded as the entrance to the infinite corridor and the rest of the campus118 alvar aaltos baker house 1947 eero saarinens mit chapel and kresge auditorium 1955 and im peis green dreyfus landau and wiesner buildings represent high forms of postwar modernist architecture140141142 more recent buildings like frank gehrys stata center 2004 steven holls simmons hall 2002 charles correas building 46 2005 and fumihiko makis media lab extension 2009 stand out among the boston areas classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus starchitecture135143 these buildings have not always been well received144145 in 2010 the princeton review included mit in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are tiny unsightly or both146 undergraduates are guaranteed fouryear housing in one of mits 11 undergraduate dormitories147 those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from livein graduate student tutors resident advisors and faculty housemasters148 because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups for example according to the yale daily news staffs the insiders guide to the colleges 2010 the split between east campus and west campus is a significant characteristic of mit east campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture149 mit also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families150 mit has an active greek and coop housing system including thirtysix fraternities sororities and independent living groups fsilgs151 as of 2015update 98 of all undergraduates lived in mitaffiliated housing 54 of the men participated in fraternities and 20 of the women were involved in sororities152 most fsilgs are located across the river in back bay near where mit was founded and there is also a cluster of fraternities on mits west campus that face the charles river basin153 after the 1997 alcoholrelated death of scott krueger a new pledge at the phi gamma delta fraternity mit required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002154 because fsilgs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen offcampus the new policy could not be implemented until simmons hall opened in that year155 in 20132014 mit abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm bexley hall citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible in 2017 mit shut down senior house after a century of service as an undergrad dorm that year mit administrators released data showing just 60 of senior house residents had graduated in four years campuswide the fouryear graduation rate is 84 the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher156 mit has substantial commercial real estate holdings in cambridge on which it pays property taxes plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes pilot on academic buildings which are legally taxexempt as of 2017update it is the largest taxpayer in the city contributing approximately 14 of the citys annual revenues157 holdings include technology square parts of kendall square university park and many properties in cambridgeport and area 4 neighboring the main campus158 the land is held for investment purposes and potential longterm expansion159 mit is a statechartered nonprofit corporation governed by a privately appointed board known as the mit corporation160 the corporation has 6080 members at any time some with fixed terms some with life appointments and eight who serve ex officio160161162163 the corporation approves the budget new programs degrees and faculty appointments and elects a president to manage the university and preside over the institutes faculty160118 the current president is sally kornbluth a cell biologist and former provost at duke university who became mits eighteenth president in january 2023164 mit has five schools science engineering architecture and planning management and humanities arts and social sciences and one college schwarzman college of computing but no schools of law or medicine165b167 faculty committees have control over many areas of mits curriculum research student life and administrative affairs168 the chair of each of mits academic departments reports to the dean of that departments school who in turn reports to the provost under the president169 academic departments are also evaluated by visiting committees specialized bodies of corporation members and outside experts who review the performance activities and needs of each department mits endowment real estate and other financial assets are managed through by the mit investment management company mitimco a subsidiary of the mit corporation created in 2004170 a minor revenue source for much of the institutes history the endowments role in mit operations has grown due to strong investment returns since the 1990s making it one the largest us university endowments171 among its holdings are a majority of shares in the audio equipment manufacturer bose corporation as well as a commercial real estate portfolio in kendall square172173 mit is a large highly residential research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs176 the university has been accredited by the new england association of schools and colleges since 1929177 mit operates on a 414 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after labor day and ending in middecember a 4week independent activities period in the month of january and the spring semester commencing in early february and ceasing in late may178 mit students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone179 departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation for example civil and environmental engineering is course 1 while linguistics and philosophy is course 24180 students majoring in electrical engineering and computer science eecs the most popular department collectively identify themselves as course 6 mit students use a combination of the departments course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects for instance the introductory calculusbased classical mechanics course is simply 801 pronounced eightohone at mit181c the fouryear fulltime undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences in 2010 it was dubbed most selective by us news188 admitting few transfer students176 and 41 of its applicants in the 20202021 admissions cycle189 it is needblind for both domestic and international applicants190 mit offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools191 in the 20172018 academic year 1045 bachelor of science degrees abbreviated sb were granted the only type of undergraduate degree mit now awardsneeds update192193 in the 2011 fall term among students who had designated a major the school of engineering was the most popular division enrolling 63 of students in its 19 degree programs followed by the school of science 29 school of humanities arts social sciences 37 sloan school of management 33 and school of architecture and planning 2needs update the largest undergraduate degree programs were in electrical engineering and computer science course 62 computer science and engineering course 63 mechanical engineering course 2 physics course 8 and mathematics course 18182 all undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the general institute requirements girs194 the science requirement generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors comprises two semesters of physics two semesters of calculus one semester of chemistry and one semester of biology there is a laboratory requirement usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major the humanities arts and social sciences hass requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities arts and social sciences including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a hass division under the communication requirement two of the hass classes plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be communicationintensive195 including substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation196 finally all students are required to complete a swimming test197 nonvarsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes194 most classes rely on a combination of lectures recitations led by associate professors or graduate students weekly problem sets psets and periodic quizzes or tests while the pace and difficulty of mit coursework has been compared to drinking from a fire hose198199200 the freshmen retention rate at mit is similar to other research universities188 the passnorecord grading system relieves some pressure for firstyear undergraduates for each class taken in the fall term freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed or otherwise not have any record of it in the spring term passing grades a b c appear on the transcript while nonpassing grades are again not recorded201 grading had previously been passno record all freshman year but was amended for the class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year202 also freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities such as experimental study group concourse or terrascope201 mits curriculum encourages students to apply scientific knowledge in practical domains an idea summarized in the institute motto of mens et manus or mind and hand203204 courses emphasizes uses of engineering knowledge in arenas like product design competitions and control design205206 in 1969 margaret macvicar founded the undergraduate research opportunities program urop to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers students join or initiate research projects urops for academic credit pay or on a volunteer basis through postings on the urop website or by contacting faculty members directly207 a substantial majority of undergraduates participate208209 students often become published file patent applications andor launch startup companies based upon their experience in urops210211 the program has been widely emulated at other us universities212 in 1970 the thendean of institute relations benson r snyder published the hidden curriculum arguing that education at mit was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education the successful student according to snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms for example organized student groups had compiled course biblescollections of problemset and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references this sort of gamesmanship snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest213214 mits graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels mit offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities social sciences and stem fields as well as professional degrees including the master of business administration mba176 the institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the master of science which is abbreviated as ms at mit various engineers degrees doctor of philosophy phd and doctor of science dsc and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the mdphd with harvard medical school and a joint program in oceanography with woods hole oceanographic institution215216217218 admission to graduate programs is decentralized applicants apply directly to the department or degree program more than 90 of doctoral students are supported by fellowships research assistantships ras or teaching assistantships tas219 mit places among the top five in many overall rankings of universities see table right and rankings based on students revealed preferences228229230 for several years us news world report the qs world university rankings and the academic ranking of world universities have ranked mits school of engineering first as did the 1995 national research council report231 in the same lists mits strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science the natural sciences business architecture economics linguistics mathematics and to a lesser extent political science and philosophy232 times higher education has recognized mit as one of the worlds six super brands on its world reputation rankings along with berkeley cambridge harvard oxford and stanford233 in 2019 it was ranked 3 among the universities around the world by scimago institutions rankings234 in 2017 the times higher education world university rankings also rated mit the 2 university for arts and humanities235236 mit was ranked 7 in 2015 and 6 in 2017 of the nature index annual tables which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals237238239 georgetown university researchers ranked mit 3 in the us for 20year return on investment240 the university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia industry and government241242 in 1946 president compton harvard business school professor georges doriot and massachusetts investor trust chairman merrill grisswold founded american research and development corporation the first american venturecapital firm243244 in 1948 compton established the mit industrial liaison program245 throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s american politicians and business leaders accused mit and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayerfunded research and technology to international especially japanese firms that were competing with struggling american businesses246247 on the other hand mits extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several mit leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940d mit established a washington office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy249250 the us justice department began an investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against mit the eight ivy league colleges and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in pricefixing during their annual overlap meetings which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for needbased scholarships251252 while the ivy league institutions settled253 mit contested the charges arguing that the practice was not anticompetitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students254255 mit ultimately prevailed when the justice department dropped the case in 1994256257 mits proximitye to harvard university the other school up the river has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the harvardmit division of health sciences and technology and the broad institute258 in addition students at the two schools can crossregister for credits toward their own schools degrees without any additional fees258 a crossregistration program between mit and wellesley college has also existed since 1969 and in 2002 the cambridgemit institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between mit and the university of cambridge258 mit also has a longterm partnership with imperial college london for both student exchanges and research collaboration259260 more modest crossregistration programs have been established with boston university brandeis university tufts university massachusetts college of art and the school of the museum of fine arts boston258 mit maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the boston area such as the charles stark draper laboratory the whitehead
