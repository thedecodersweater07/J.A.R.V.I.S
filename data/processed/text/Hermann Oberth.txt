hermann julius oberth german hrman julis obrt 25 june 1894 28 december 1989 was an austrohungarianborn romanian5 and german physicist and rocket pioneer of transylvanian saxon descent3 oberth supported nazi germanys war effort and received the war merit cross 1st class in 19436 oberth was born into a transylvanian saxon family in nagyszeben hermannstadt kingdom of hungary today sibiu in romania7 and besides his native german he was fluent in hungarian and romanian as well at the age of 11 oberths interest in rocketry was sparked by the novels of jules verne especially from the earth to the moon and around the moon he was fond of reading them over and over until they were engraved in his memory8 as a result oberth constructed his first model rocket as a school student at the age of 14 in his youthful experiments he arrived independently at the concept of the multistage rocket during this time however he lacked the resources to put his ideas into practice in 1912 oberth began studying medicine in munich germany but after world war i broke out he was drafted into the imperial german army assigned to an infantry battalion and sent to the eastern front against russia in 1915 oberth was moved into a medical unit at a hospital in segesvr german schburg romanian sighioara transylvania in austriahungary today romania9 there he found the spare time to conduct a series of experiments concerning weightlessness and later resumed his rocketry designs by 1917 he showed designs of a missile using liquid propellant with a range of 290 km 180 mi to hermann von stein the prussian minister of war10 on 6 july 1918 oberth married mathilde hummel with whom he had four children among oberths children one lost his life as a soldier during world war ii his daughter ilse born 1924 died on august 28 1944 in an accidental explosion at the redlzipf v2 rocket engine test facility and liquid oxygen plant where she worked as a rocket technician in 1919 oberth once again moved to germany this time to study physics initially in munich and later at the university of gttingen in 1922 oberths proposed doctoral dissertation on rocket science was rejected as utopian however professor augustin maior of the university of cluj in romania offered oberth the opportunity to defend his original dissertation there in order to receive a doctorate11 he did so successfully on 23 may 19239 he next had his 92page work published privately in june 1923 as the somewhat controversial book die rakete zu den planetenrumen12 the rocket into planetary space13 by 1929 oberth had expanded this work to a 429page book titled wege zur raumschiffahrt ways to spaceflight14 oberth commented later that he made the deliberate choice not to write another doctoral dissertation he wrote i refrained from writing another one thinking to myself never mind i will prove that i am able to become a greater scientist than some of you even without the title of doctor15 oberth criticized the german system of education saying our educational system is like an automobile which has strong rear lights brightly illuminating the past but looking forward things are barely discernible15 oberth became in 1927 a member of the verein fr raumschiffahrt vfr the spaceflight society an amateur rocketry group that had taken great inspiration from his book and oberth acted as something of a mentor to the enthusiasts who joined the society which included persons such as wernher von braun rolf engel rudolf nebel or paul ehmayr oberth lacked the opportunities to work or to teach at the college or university level as did many welleducated experts in the physical sciences and engineering in the time period of the 1920s through the 1930s with the situation becoming much worse during the worldwide great depression that started in 1929 therefore from 1924 through 1938 oberth supported himself and his family by teaching physics and mathematics at the stephan ludwig roth high school in media romania9 during portions of 1928 and 1929 oberth served as a scientific advisor in berlin for the film frau im mond the woman in the moon this pioneering film was directed and produced by the renowned filmmaker fritz lang in collaboration with the universum film ag company the film was of enormous value in popularizing the ideas of rocketry and space exploration one of oberths main assignments was to build and launch a rocket as a publicity event just before the films premiere he also designed the model of the friede the main rocket portrayed in the film on june 5 1929 oberth won the inaugural prix rephirsch rephirsch award from the french astronomical society this honor recognized his significant contributions to the field of astronautics and interplanetary travel specifically highlighted in his book wege zur raumschiffahrt14 ways to spaceflight the book an expanded version of die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket to interplanetary space secured his position as a prominent figure in the field16 the volume is dedicated to fritz lang and thea von harbou14 oberths student max valier joined forces with fritz von opel to create the worlds first largescale experimental rocket program opelrak leading to speed records for ground and rail vehicles and the worlds first rocket plane opel rak1 a purposebuilt design by julius hatry17 was demonstrated to the public and world media on september 30 1929 piloted by von opel valiers and von opels demonstrations had a strong and longlasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers in particular on another of oberths students wernher von braun shortly after the opel rak teams successful liquidfuel rocket launches of april 10 and 12 1929 by friedrich wilhelm sander at opel rennbahn in rsselsheim oberth conducted in the autumn of 1929 a static firing of his first liquidfueled rocket motor which he named the kegeldse the engine was built by klaus riedel in a workshop space provided by the reich institution of chemical technology and although it lacked a cooling system it did run briefly18 he was helped in this experiment by an 18yearold student wernher von braun who would later become a giant in both german and american rocket engineering from the 1940s onward culminating with the gigantic saturn v rockets that made it possible for man to land on the moon in 1969 and in several following years indeed von braun said of him hermann oberth was the first who when thinking about the possibility of spaceships grabbed a sliderule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs i myself owe to him not only the guidingstar of my life but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel a place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his groundbreaking contributions in the field of astronautics2 in 1923 oberths book the rocket to the planetary spaces was published12 this publication is generally regarded as a kind of initial spark for rocket and space travel enthusiasm in germany many later rocket engineers were inspired by his precise and comprehensive theoretical considerations and his bold conclusions19 the work sparked heated debates known at the time as the battle of the many formulas the second edition appeared in 1925 and it was also sold out after a short time20 in his book oberth puts forward the following theses with the launch of sputnik 1957 and the flight of yuri gagarin 1961 into space these ideas which were still completely utopian at the beginning of the 1920s became a reality less than four decades later marsha freeman writes the rockets were only a means to an end his goal was space travel21 oberth thought of interplanetary space travel of a multiplanetary humanity in his first book in 1923 he gives the first outlook he goes into more detail on physical and physicalchemical as well as physiological experiments in weightless space on the space telescope research into the solar corona the space station for earth observation and the space mirror in earth orbit for influencing the weather12 the third greatly expanded edition of his first book was published by oberth in 1929 with the new title ways to spaceflight14 in the years that followed the book became the standard work for space exploration and rocket technology and was called the bible of scientific astronautics by the french aviation and rocket pioneer robert esnaultpelterie20 117 in this book oberth describes possible uses of his twostage rocket among other things on pages 285 to 333 the crewed space flight including space suit for external use the space telescope for earth observation and the duration of interplanetary flights on pages 333 to 350 his ideas and the theoretical basis for space stations in near earth orbit from 700 to 1200 km above the ground for earth and weather observation and as a starting point for flights to the moon and to the planets on pages 336 to 351 he explains the construction and function of the space mirror1214 he invented in 1923 with 100 bis 300 km in diameter in earth orbit with which among other things the weather is to be influenced in a targeted regional manner or the solar radiation is to be weakened in a targeted regional manner on pages 350 to 386 in the chapter journeys to strange worlds hermann oberth presents his scientific considerations and calculations for flights including landings to the moon to asteroids to mars to venus to mercury and to comets in 1923 oberth initially outlined the concept of his space mirrors in his book die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket to interplanetary space these mirrors with diameters ranging from 100 to 300 km were envisioned to be composed of a grid network consisting of individually adjustable facets oberths concept of space mirrors in orbit around the earth serves the purpose of focusing sunlight on specific regions of the planets surface or redirecting it into space this approach differs from creating shaded areas at the lagrange point between the earth and the sun as it does not involve diminishing solar radiation across the entire exposed surface according to oberth these colossal orbital mirrors possess the potential to illuminate individual cities safeguard against natural disasters manipulate weather patterns and climate and even create additional living space for billions of people he places significant emphasis on their capacity to influence the trajectories of barometric high and lowpressure areas however it is important to acknowledge that the implementation of such climate engineering interventions including space mirrors requires further extensive research before their practical applicability can be fully realized further publications followed in which he took into account the technical progress achieved up to that point ways to spaceflight 1929 menschen im weltraum neue projekte fr raketenund raumfahrt people in space new projects for rocket and space 1957 and der weltraumspiegel the space mirror 1978 to optimize costs oberths concept proposes the utilization of lunar minerals for producing components on the moon the moons lower gravitational pull necessitates less energy for launching these components into lunar orbit additionally the earths atmosphere is spared the burden of numerous rocket launches the envisioned process involves launching the components from the lunar surface into lunar orbit using an electromagnetic lunar slingshot subsequently stacking them at a 60 libration point these components could then be transported into orbit via electric spaceships designed by oberth with minimal recoil once in orbit the components would be assembled into mirrors with diameters ranging from 100 to 300 km oberths estimate in 1978 suggested that the realization of this concept could occur between 2018 and 2038 oberth emphasized that these mirrors could potentially serve as weapons given this aspect coupled with the complexity of the project the realization of these mirrors would only be feasible as a peace initiative undertaken by humanity1214 8788 222324 in 2023 the space mirror devised by oberth is categorized within the field of climate engineering specifically under solar radiation management srm as a subset of spacemirrors the associated risks of these deliberate interventions in weather and climate are also examined and deliberated upon within this classification hermann oberth published his concept of a moving and jumping lunar vehicle for future extensive lunar exploration in 19532526 in his considerations he assumed that large distances should be covered quickly and that extensive fissuresravines or impassable terrain that block the way should be overcome so that large detours can be avoided the vehicle which would weigh about 10000 kg on earth and only 1654 kg on the moon due to the weak gravitational pull would be built on earth transported to the moon and dropped on the lunar surface the towerlike structure has only one leg and it stands on a tracked chassis with a footprint of 25 m x 25 m a motor with 515 kw of power is sufficient to drive at a speed of up to 150 kmh depending on the terrain the required energy in the form of electrical current is supplied by the solar power plant above the crew cabin and the gyroscope the leg is a gastight cylinder in which the 45 m long jumping leg can move up and down like a piston in a shock absorber and can be extended and retracted for jumping the powerful gyroscope above the crew cabin keeps the vehicle vertical and ensures that the vehicle can never tilt more than 45 degrees the jumps could be up to 125 m high and several 100 m wide jumping would occur if the vehicle had to overcome an impassable area or fissuresravines or if it had to get from a higher location eg a mountain terrace to a lower location or vice versa27 oberth writes i wanted to present my readers not just with a rough sketch of the lunar car but with drawings and descriptions based on precise calculations and designs so i racked my brains over hundreds of details calculated compared constructed rejected and replanned until the design was such that i could present it with a clear conscience now i can say i am sure that my moon car can be built feasibility studies or development work on oberths lunar vehicle have not begun until 2023 because there are no concrete plans for lunar exploration in which such a large vehicle could be used the principle of ion propulsion was first presented in 1929 by the space pioneer hermann oberth in his work ways to spaceflight14 which is referred to as the bible of space technology20 117 in which he describes for the first time the physics the function the construction and the use for the interplanetary flight of an ion engine on pages 386 to 399 oberth also presented at the 12th rocket and space conference of the deutsche raketengesellschaft drg german rocket society in september 1963 in hamburg frg a new idea for the electric spaceship28 quote my proposal concerns an electric spaceship that does not emit ions and electrons but rather nebula droplets that are 1000 to 100000 times larger in size depending on the project and to form an ion or electron as a condensation nucleus from 1923 to 1938 oberth worked with short breaks in 1929 and 1930 as a high school teacher for physics and mathematics in his home country transylvania in romania20 the romanian hermann oberth known worldwide in the professional world with his many foreign contacts was regarded as a security risk for the secrecy of the development work on aggregate 4 in peenemnde therefore from june 1938 he was employed sidelined from june 1938 by means of a twoyear research contract with the german research institute for aviation dvl at the vienna university of technology and then from july 1940 at the university of technology dresden in the greater german reich29 when he wanted to return to transylvania in may 1941 he received german citizenship and was conscripted in august 1941 under the alias friedrich hann30 58 to the army research institute peenemnde where the worlds first large rocket the aggregat 4 later called vergeltungswaffe v2 was developed under the direction of wernher von braun oberth was not involved in this work30 58 19 150 29 157164 31 101 but placed in the patent review32 144 19 94 and wrote various reports for example about the best outline of multistage rockets and about defense against enemy planes with large remotecontrolled solid missile3219 oberth criticized the v2 design because in his view it was too complicated and too expensive for military purposes he would have developed a solid fuel rocket for the v2s intended purposes20 around september 1943 he was awarded the kriegsverdienstkreuz i klasse mit schwertern war merit cross 1st class with swords for his outstanding courageous behavior during the attack on 1718 aug 1943 on peenemnde by operation hydra part of allied operations against the german rocket programme6 in december 1943 oberth asked for his transfer31 101 to wasag in reinsdorf near wittenbergfrg to develop the antiaircraft solid missile recommended by him he fled from there in april 1945 had to go to two different us internment camps was released in august 1945 as a person unaffected by the nazi era and came to live with his family in feucht middle franconia frg202119 where his family had already moved in 194320 feucht is located near the regional capital of nuremberg which became part of the american zone of occupied germany and also the location of the highlevel warcrimes trials of the surviving nazi leaders oberth was not involved in the american project paperclip because he was not involved in the development of the aggregat 4 later called vergeltungswaffe v2 for oberth there was no employment in germany either as a teacher of physics or mathematics or as a scientist that is why hermann oberth went to switzerland in 1948 and worked there both as a scientific consultant and as an author for the specialist journal interavia in the years 1950 to 1953 he was in the service of the italian navy and developed a solid fuel rocket in 1953 oberth returned to feucht germany to publish his book menschen im weltraum man into space in which he described his ideas for spacebased reflecting telescopes space stations electricpowered spaceships and space suits oberth eventually worked from 1955 for his former assistant wernher von braun who was developing space rockets for nasa in huntsville alabama among other things oberth was involved in preparing the study the development of space technology in the next ten years in 1958 oberth returned to feucht germany where he published his ideas for a lunar exploration vehicle a moon catapult and damped helicopters and airplanes in 1961 oberth returned to the united states where he worked for the convair corporation as a technical consultant for the atlas missile program he retired in 196232212920 during the 1950s and 1960s oberth offered his opinions regarding unidentified flying objects ufos he was a supporter of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for the origin of the ufos that were seen from earth for example in an article in the american weekly magazine of 24 october 1954 oberth stated it is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system i think that they possibly are manned by intelligent observers who are members of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries33 he also published in the second edition of flying saucer review an article titled they come from outer space he discussed the history of reports of strange luminous objects in the sky mentioning that the earliest historical case is of shining shields reported by pliny the elder he wrote having weighed all the pros and cons i find the explanation of flying discs from outer space the most likely one i call this the uraniden hypothesis because from our viewpoint the hypothetical beings appear to come from the sky greek uranos34 oberth retired in 1962 at the age of 68 from 1965 to 1967 he was a member of the national democratic party of germany which was considered to be far right in july 1969 oberth returned to the united states to witness the launch of the apollo project saturn v rocket from the kennedy space center in florida that carried the apollo 11 crew on the first landing mission to the moon35 the 1973 oil crisis inspired oberth to look into alternative energy sources including a plan for a wind power station that could utilize the jet stream however his primary interest during his retirement years was to turn to more abstract philosophical questions most notable among his several books from this period is primer for those who would govern oberth returned to the united states to view the launch of sts61a the space shuttle challenger launched 30 october 1985 oberth died in nuremberg west germany on 28 december 1989 just shortly after the fall of the iron curtain1036 oberth was described as a loyal supporter and donor by stille hilfe a nazi support organisation in its obituary of him37 list from the oberth biography by hans barth20 hermann oberth is memorialized by the hermann oberth space travel museum in feucht germany and by the hermann oberth society the museum brings together scientists researchers engineers and astronauts from the east and the west to carry on his work in rocketry and space exploration in 1980 oberth was inducted into the international air space hall of fame at the san diego air space museum42 the danish astronautical society has named hermann oberth an honorary member43 in romania the faculty of engineering of lucian blaga university of sibiu is named after him44 in 1994 a memorial house was established in media on the 100th anniversary of his birth it exhibits various items related to rocket technology and space travel and also has an audiovideo room for documentary films45 he discovered the oberth effect powered flyby or oberth maneuver a fuelsaving strategy for interplanetary space flight that is commonly used today there are also a crater on the moon and asteroid 9253 oberth named after him in star trek iii the search for spock the uss grissom was classified as an oberthclass starship several other oberthclass starships also appeared in subsequent star trek films and television series
