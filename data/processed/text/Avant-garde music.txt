avantgarde music is music that is considered to be at the forefront of innovation in its field with the term avantgarde implying a critique of existing aesthetic conventions rejection of the status quo in favor of unique or original elements and the idea of deliberately challenging or alienating audiences1 avantgarde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition whereas experimental music lies outside tradition avantgarde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition whereas experimental music lies outside tradition2 the biggest distinction between avantgarde and experimental music was how it relates to tradition other distinctions include subject matter as well as having a superficial idea to avoid diving into serious subjects even though avantgarde and experimental music have many distinctions experimental music and avantgarde music also have similarities due to experimental music being referred to as the contemporary avantgarde which is in relation to the electronic style of music being the forefront of many compositions in the 1960s and 1970s3 in a historical sense some musicologists use the term avantgarde music for the radical compositions that succeeded the death of anton webern in 19454verification needed but others disagree for example ryan minor writes that this period began with the work of richard wagner5 whereas edward lowinsky cites josquin des prez6 the term may also be used to refer to any post1945 tendency of modernist music not definable as experimental music though sometimes including a type of experimental music characterized by the rejection of tonality4 a commonly cited example of avantgarde music is john cages 433 19521 a piece which instructs the performers not to play their instruments during its entire duration7 the piece has been described as not a musical work in the normal sense only an occasion for a zenlike meditation8 although some modernist music is also avantgarde a distinction can be made between the two categories according to scholar larry sitsky because the purpose of avantgarde music is necessarily political social and cultural critique so that it challenges social and artistic values by provoking or goading audiences composers such as igor stravinsky richard strauss arnold schoenberg anton webern george antheil and claude debussy may reasonably be considered to have been avantgardists in their early works which were understood as provocative whether or not the composers intended them that way but sitsky does not consider the label appropriate for their later music9 for example modernists of the postworld war ii period such as milton babbitt luciano berio elliott carter gyrgy ligeti and witold lutosawski never conceived their music for the purpose of goading an audience and cannot therefore be classified as avantgarde composers such as john cage and harry partch on the contrary remained avantgardists throughout their creative careers9 a prominent feature of avantgarde music is to break through various rules and regulations of traditional culture in order to transcend established creative principles and appreciation habits avantgarde music pursues novelty in musical form and style insisting that art is above everything else thus it creates a transcendental and mysterious sound world hint metaphor symbol association imagery synesthesia and perception are widely used in avantgarde music techniques to excavate the mystery of human heart and the flow of consciousness so that many seemingly unrelated but essentially very important events interweave into multilevel structures and forms10 popular music by definition is designed for mass appeal11 the 1960s saw a wave of avantgarde experimentation in jazz represented by artists such as ornette coleman sun ra albert ayler archie shepp john coltrane and miles davis1213 in the rock music of the 1970s the art descriptor was generally understood to mean aggressively avantgarde or pretentiously progressive14 postpunk artists from the late 1970s rejected traditional rock sensibilities in favor of an avantgarde aesthetic15 in 1988 the writer greg tate described hip hop music as the only avantgarde around still delivering the shock of the new16 the beatles song revolution 9 is one of the most popular examples of avantgarde music inspired pieces in popular music records the song is the penultimate track to their 1968 album the beatles also known as the white album contemporaryclassical music populartraditional music
