aerospace refers to the technology and industry involved with the atmosphere and outer space collectively aerospace activity is very diverse with a multitude of commercial industrial and military applications aerospace engineering consists of aeronautics and astronautics aerospace organizations research design manufacture operate maintain and repair both aircraft and spacecraft1 the border between space and the atmosphere has been proposed as 100 kilometres 621 mi above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air density is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity this border has been called the krmn line2 in most industrial countries the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors for example several states have a civilian space program funded by the government such as national aeronautics and space administration in the united states european space agency in europe the canadian space agency in canada indian space research organisation in india japan aerospace exploration agency in japan roscosmos state corporation for space activities in russia china national space administration in china suparco in pakistan iranian space agency in iran and korea aerospace research institute in south korea along with these public space programs many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites some known companies involved in space programs include boeing cobham airbus spacex lockheed martin rtx corporation mda and northrop grumman these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace such as the construction of aircraft modern aerospace began with engineer george cayley in 1799 cayley proposed an aircraft with a fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail defining characteristics of the modern aeroplane3 the 19th century saw the creation of the aeronautical society of great britain 1866 the american rocketry society and the institute of aeronautical sciences all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline3 airmen like otto lilienthal who introduced cambered airfoils in 1891 used gliders to analyze aerodynamic forces3 the wright brothers were interested in lilienthals work and read several of his publications3 they also found inspiration in octave chanute an airman and the author of progress in flying machines 18943 it was the preliminary work of cayley lilienthal chanute and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at kitty hawk north carolina on december 17 1903 by the wright brothers war and science fiction inspired scientists and engineers like konstantin tsiolkovsky and wernher von braun to achieve flight beyond the atmosphere world war ii inspired wernher von braun to create the v1 and v2 rockets the launch of sputnik 1 in october 1957 started the space age and on july 20 1969 apollo 11 achieved the first crewed moon landing3 in april 1981 the space shuttle columbia launched the start of regular crewed access to orbital space a sustained human presence in orbital space started with mir in 1986 and is continued by the international space station3 space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace aerospace manufacturing is a hightechnology industry that produces aircraft guided missiles space vehicles aircraft engines propulsion units and related parts4 most of the industry is geared toward governmental work for each original equipment manufacturer oem the us government has assigned a commercial and government entity cage code these codes help to identify each manufacturer repair facilities and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry in the united states the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products others include the very large airline industry the aerospace industry employed 472000 wage and salary workers in 20065 most of those jobs were in washington state and in california with missouri new york and texas also being important the leading aerospace manufacturers in the us are boeing united technologies corporation spacex northrop grumman and lockheed martin as talented american employees age and retire these manufacturers face an expanding labor shortfall in order to supply the industrial sector with fresh workers apprenticeship programs like the aerospace joint apprenticeship council ajac collaborate with community colleges and aerospace firms in washington state important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include washington state boeing california boeing lockheed martin etc and montreal quebec canada bombardier pratt whitney canada in north america toulouse france airbus se and hamburg germany airbus se in europe as well as so jos dos campos brazil embraer quertaro mexico bombardier aerospace general electric aviation and mexicali mexico united technologies corporation gulfstream aerospace in latin america in the european union aerospace companies such as airbus se safran thales dassault aviation leonardo and saab ab account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products in india bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry where hindustan aeronautics limited the national aerospace laboratories and the indian space research organisation are headquartered the indian space research organisation isro launched indias first moon orbiter chandrayaan1 in october 2008 in russia large aerospace companies like oboronprom and the united aircraft building corporation encompassing mikoyan sukhoi ilyushin tupolev yakovlev and irkut which includes beriev are among the major global players in this industry the historic soviet union was also the home of a major aerospace industry the united kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry making its own airliners and warplanes but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies and it has turned into a large import customer too from countries such as the united states however the united kingdom has a very active aerospace sector with major companies such as bae systems supplying fully assembled aircraft aircraft components subassemblies and subsystems to other manufacturers both in europe and all over the world canada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes etc eg the cf100 fighter but for some decades it has relied on imports from the united states and europe to fill these needs however canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable another notable example was the late 1950s development of the avro canada cf105 arrow a supersonic fighterinterceptor whose 1959 cancellation was considered highly controversial france has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy and sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the swedish air forceespecially in support of its position as a neutral country see saab ab other european countries either team up in making fighters such as the panavia tornado and the eurofighter typhoon or else to import them from the united states pakistan has a developing aerospace engineering industry the national engineering and scientific commission khan research laboratories and pakistan aeronautical complex are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets missiles and space vehicles the city of kamra is home to the pakistan aeronautical complex which contains several factories this facility is responsible for manufacturing the mfi17 mfi395 k8 and jf17 thunder aircraft pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles in the peoples republic of china beijing xian chengdu shanghai shenyang and nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry china has developed an extensive capability to design test and produce military aircraft missiles and space vehicles despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental shanghai y10 china is still developing its civil aerospace industry the aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of secondhand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector within the united states there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow this includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and tag a part this certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet oem specifications once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market when an airline has an aircraft on the ground the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable this can drive the market for specific parts there are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts in the aerospace and defense industry much consolidation occurred at the end of the 20th century and in the early 21st century between 1988 and 2011 more than 6068 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of us678 billion were announced worldwide6 the largest transactions have been multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace many of them pioneered around world war ii11 functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment it implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger risk damage or injury functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry which allows no compromises or negligence in this respect supervisory bodies such as the european aviation safety agency easa12 regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards this is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety the standards as 9100 in america en 9100 on the european market or jisq 9100 in asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry these are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles some companies are therefore specialized in the certification inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by nasa and redesigned for an alternate purpose13 these technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry with 52 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology including computers and cellular devices13 these spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine transportation energy consumer goods public safety and more13 nasa publishes an annual report called spinoffs regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use14 for example in the most recent edition of this publication spinoffs 2015 endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement13 this device enables more precise and subsequently costeffective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization13 these nasa technologies are not only giving companies and entrepreneurs a competitive edge in their own industries but are also helping to shape budding industries such as commercial lunar landers said daniel lockney15
