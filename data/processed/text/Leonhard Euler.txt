leonhard euler lr oylrb 15 april 1707 18 september 1783 was a swiss polymath who was active as a mathematician physicist astronomer logician geographer and engineer he founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory complex analysis and infinitesimal calculus he also introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation including the notion of a mathematical function3 he is known for his work in mechanics fluid dynamics optics astronomy and music theory4 euler has been called a universal genius who was fully equipped with almost unlimited powers of imagination intellectual gifts and extraordinary memory5 he spent most of his adult life in saint petersburg russia and in berlin then the capital of prussia euler is credited for popularizing the greek letter displaystyle pi lowercase pi to denote the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter as well as first using the notation f x displaystyle fx for the value of a function the letter i displaystyle i to express the imaginary unit 1 displaystyle sqrt 1 the greek letter displaystyle sigma capital sigma to express summations the greek letter displaystyle delta capital delta for finite differences and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters6 he gave the current definition of the constant e displaystyle e the base of the natural logarithm now known as eulers number7 euler made contributions to applied mathematics and engineering such as his study of ships which helped navigation his three volumes on optics which contributed to the design of microscopes and telescopes and his studies of beam bending and column critical loads8 euler is credited with being the first to develop graph theory partly as a solution for the problem of the seven bridges of knigsberg which is also considered the first practical application of topology he also became famous for among many other accomplishments solving several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis including the famous basel problem euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron that has no holes equals 2 a number now commonly known as the euler characteristic in physics euler reformulated isaac newtons laws of motion into new laws in his twovolume work mechanica to better explain the motion of rigid bodies he contributed to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects euler formulated the partial differential equations for the motion of inviscid fluid8 and laid the mathematical foundations of potential theory5 euler is regarded as arguably the most prolific contributor in the history of mathematics and science and the greatest mathematician of the 18th century98 his 866 publications and his correspondence are being collected in the opera omnia leonhard euler which when completed will consist of 81 quartos101112 several great mathematicians who worked after eulers death have recognised his importance in the field pierresimon laplace said read euler read euler he is the master of us all13c carl friedrich gauss wrote the study of eulers works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics and nothing else can replace it14d leonhard euler was born in basel on 15 april 1707 to paul iii euler a pastor of the reformed church and marguerite ne brucker whose ancestors include a number of wellknown scholars in the classics16 he was the oldest of four children with two younger sisters anna maria and maria magdalena and a younger brother johann heinrich1716 soon after leonhards birth the eulers moved from basel to riehen switzerland where his father became pastor in the local church and leonhard spent most of his childhood16 from a young age euler received schooling in mathematics from his father who had taken courses from jacob bernoulli some years earlier at the university of basel around the age of eight euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmothers house and enrolled in the latin school in basel in addition he received private tutoring from johannes burckhardt a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics16 in 1720 at age 13 euler enrolled at the university of basel4 attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time16 the course on elementary mathematics was given by johann bernoulli the younger brother of the deceased jacob bernoulli who had taught eulers father johann bernoulli and euler soon got to know each other better euler described bernoulli in his autobiography18 the famous professor johann bernoulli made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences private lessons however he refused because of his busy schedule however he gave me a far more salutary advice which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence and should i encounter some objections or difficulties he offered me free access to him every saturday afternoon and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties which was done with such a desired advantage that when he resolved one of my objections ten others at once disappeared which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences during this time euler backed by bernoulli obtained his fathers consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor1920 in 1723 euler received a master of philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of ren descartes and isaac newton16 afterwards he enrolled in the theological faculty of the university of basel20 in 1726 euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound titled de sono2122 with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the university of basel23 in 1727 he entered the paris academy prize competition offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 172024 for the first time the problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship pierre bouguer who became known as the father of naval architecture won and euler took second place25 over the years euler entered this competition 15 times24 winning 12 of them25 johann bernoullis two sons daniel and nicolaus entered into service at the imperial russian academy of sciences in saint petersburg in 1725 leaving euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available23 on 31 july 1726 nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in russia2627 when daniel assumed his brothers position in the mathematicsphysics division he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend euler23 in november 1726 euler eagerly accepted the offer but delayed making the trip to saint petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the university of basel23 euler arrived in saint petersburg in may 17272320 he was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department he lodged with daniel bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration28 euler mastered russian settled into life in saint petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the russian navy29 the academy at saint petersburg established by peter the great was intended to improve education in russia and to close the scientific gap with western europe as a result it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like euler25 the academys benefactress catherine i who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband died before eulers arrival to saint petersburg30 the russian conservative nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelveyearold peter ii30 the nobility suspicious of the academys foreign scientists cut funding for euler and his colleagues and prevented the entrance of foreign and nonaristocratic students into the gymnasium and universities30 conditions improved slightly after the death of peter ii in 1730 and the germaninfluenced anna of russia assumed power31 euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 173131 he also left the russian navy refusing a promotion to lieutenant31 two years later daniel bernoulli fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at saint petersburg left for basel euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department32 in january 1734 he married katharina gsell 17071773 a daughter of georg gsell33 frederick ii had made an attempt to recruit the services of euler for his newly established berlin academy in 1740 but euler initially preferred to stay in st petersburg34 but after empress anna died and frederick ii agreed to pay 1600 ecus the same as euler earned in russia he agreed to move to berlin in 1741 he requested permission to leave for berlin arguing he was in need of a milder climate for his eyesight34 the russian academy gave its consent and would pay him 200 rubles per year as one of its active members34 concerned about the continuing turmoil in russia euler left st petersburg in june 1741 to take up a post at the berlin academy which he had been offered by frederick the great of prussia35 he lived for 15 years in berlin where he wrote several hundred articles20 in 1748 his text on functions called the introductio in analysin infinitorum was published and in 1755 a text on differential calculus called the institutiones calculi differentialis was published3637 in 1755 he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences38 and of the french academy of sciences39 notable students of euler in berlin included stepan rumovsky later considered as the first russian astronomer4041 in 1748 he declined an offer from the university of basel to succeed the recently deceased johann bernoulli20 in 1753 he bought a house in charlottenburg in which he lived with his family and widowed mother4243 euler became the tutor for friederike charlotte of brandenburgschwedt the princess of anhaltdessau and fredericks niece he wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s which were later compiled into a volume entitled letters of euler on different subjects in natural philosophy addressed to a german princess44 this work contained eulers exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics and offered valuable insights into eulers personality and religious beliefs it was translated into multiple languages published across europe and in the united states and became more widely read than any of his mathematical works the popularity of the letters testifies to eulers ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist37 despite eulers immense contribution to the academys prestige and having been put forward as a candidate for its presidency by jean le rond dalembert frederick ii named himself as its president43 the prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and illinformed on matters beyond numbers and figures euler was a simple devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs he was in many ways the polar opposite of voltaire who enjoyed a high place of prestige at fredericks court euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about making him the frequent target of voltaires wit37 frederick also expressed disappointment with eulers practical engineering abilities stating i wanted to have a water jet in my garden euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir from where it should fall back through channels finally spurting out in sanssouci my mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir vanity of vanities vanity of geometry45 however the disappointment was almost surely unwarranted from a technical perspective eulers calculations look likely to be correct even if eulers interactions with frederick and those constructing his fountain may have been dysfunctional46 throughout his stay in berlin euler maintained a strong connection to the academy in st petersburg and also published 109 papers in russia47 he also assisted students from the st petersburg academy and at times accommodated russian students in his house in berlin47 in 1760 with the seven years war raging eulers farm in charlottenburg was sacked by advancing russian troops42 upon learning of this event general ivan petrovich saltykov paid compensation for the damage caused to eulers estate with empress elizabeth of russia later adding a further payment of 4000 rublesan exorbitant amount at the time48 euler decided to leave berlin in 1766 and return to russia49 during his berlin years 17411766 euler was at the peak of his productivity he wrote 380 works 275 of which were published50 this included 125 memoirs in the berlin academy and over 100 memoirs sent to the st petersburg academy which had retained him as a member and paid him an annual stipend eulers introductio in analysin infinitorum was published in two parts in 1748 in addition to his own research euler supervised the library the observatory the botanical garden and the publication of calendars and maps from which the academy derived income51 he was even involved in the design of the water fountains at sanssouci the kings summer palace52 the political situation in russia stabilized after catherine the greats accession to the throne so in 1766 euler accepted an invitation to return to the st petersburg academy his conditions were quite exorbitanta 3000 ruble annual salary a pension for his wife and the promise of highranking appointments for his sons at the university he was assisted by his student anders johan lexell53 while living in st petersburg a fire in 1771 destroyed his home54 on 7 january 1734 euler married katharina gsell daughter of georg gsell a painter at the academy gymnasium in saint petersburg33 the couple bought a house by the neva river of their 13 children five survived childhood55 three sons and two daughters56 their first son was johann albrecht euler whose godfather was christian goldbach56 three years after his wifes death in 177354 euler married her halfsister salome abigail gsell57 this marriage lasted until his death in 1783 his brother johann heinrich settled in st petersburg in 1735 and was employed as a painter at the academy34 early in his life euler memorized virgils aeneid and by old age he could recite the poem and give the first and last sentence on each page of the edition from which he had learnt it5859 euler knew the first hundred prime numbers and could give each of their powers up to the sixth degree60 euler was known as a generous and kind person not neurotic as seen in some geniuses keeping his goodnatured disposition even after becoming entirely blind60 eulers eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career in 1738 three years after nearly dying of fever61 he became almost blind in his right eye euler blamed the cartography he performed for the st petersburg academy for his condition62 but the cause of his blindness remains the subject of speculation6364 eulers vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in germany to the extent that frederick called him cyclops euler said of his loss of vision now i will have fewer distractions62 in 1766 a cataract in his left eye was discovered though couching of the cataract temporarily improved his vision complications rendered him almost totally blind in the left eye as well39 his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity with the aid of his scribes eulers productivity in many areas of study increased65 in 1775 he produced on average one mathematical paper per week39 in st petersburg on 18 september 1783 after a lunch with his family euler was discussing the newly discovered planet uranus and its orbit with anders johan lexell when he collapsed and died of a brain hemorrhage63 jacob von staehlin de wrote a short obituary for the russian academy of sciences and russian mathematician nicolas fuss one of eulers disciples wrote a more detailed eulogy55 which he delivered at a memorial meeting in his eulogy for the french academy french mathematician and philosopher marquis de condorcet wrote il cessa de calculer et de vivre he ceased to calculate and to live66 euler was buried next to katharina at the smolensk lutheran cemetery on vasilievsky island in 1837 the russian academy of sciences installed a new monument replacing his overgrown grave plaque in 1957 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth his tomb was moved to the lazarevskoe cemetery at the alexander nevsky monastery67 euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics including geometry infinitesimal calculus trigonometry algebra and number theory as well as continuum physics lunar theory and other areas of physics he is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics if printed his works many of which are of fundamental interest would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes39 eulers name is associated with a large number of topics eulers work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783 he also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts it has been estimated that leonhard euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics physics mechanics astronomy and navigation in the 18th century while other researchers credit euler for a third of the output in mathematics in that century6 euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks most notably he introduced the concept of a function3 and was the first to write fx to denote the function f applied to the argument x he also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm now also known as eulers number the greek letter for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary unit68 the use of the greek letter to denote the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter was also popularized by euler although it originated with welsh mathematician william jones69 the development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18thcentury mathematical research and the bernoullisfamily friends of eulerwere responsible for much of the early progress in the field thanks to their influence studying calculus became the major focus of eulers work while some of eulers proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour70 in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra his ideas led to many great advances euler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms71 such as e x n 0 x n n lim n 1 0 x 1 x 2 2 x n n displaystyle exsum n0infty xn over nlim nto infty leftfrac 10frac x1frac x22cdots frac xnnright eulers use of power series enabled him to solve the basel problem finding the sum of the reciprocals of squares of every natural number in 1735 he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741 the basel problem was originally posed by pietro mengoli in 1644 and by the 1730s was a famous open problem popularized by jacob bernoulli and unsuccessfully attacked by many of the leading mathematicians of the time euler found that727370 n 1 1 n 2 lim n 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 n 2 2 6 displaystyle sum n1infty 1 over n2lim nto infty leftfrac 112frac 122frac 132cdots frac 1n2rightfrac pi 26

the eulermascheroni constant and studied its relationship with the harmonic series the gamma function and values of the riemann zeta function74 euler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs he discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms68 he also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions for any real number taken to be radians eulers formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies e i cos i sin displaystyle eivarphi cos varphi isin varphi which was called the most remarkable formula in mathematics by richard feynman75 a special case of the above formula is known as eulers identity e i 1 0 displaystyle eipi 10 euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function7677 and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations78 he found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis he invented the calculus of variations and formulated the eulerlagrange equation for reducing optimization problems in this area to the solution of differential equations euler pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems in doing so he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study analytic number theory in breaking ground for this new field euler created the theory of hypergeometric series qseries hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions for example he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed eulers work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem79 eulers interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of christian goldbach80 his friend in the st petersburg academy61 much of eulers early work on number theory was based on the work of pierre de fermat euler developed some of fermats ideas and disproved some of his conjectures such as his conjecture that all numbers of the form 2 2 n 1 textstyle 22n1 fermat numbers are prime81 euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis he proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges in doing so he discovered the connection between the riemann zeta function and prime numbers this is known as the euler product formula for the riemann zeta function82 euler invented the totient function n the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer n that are coprime to n using properties of this function he generalized fermats little theorem to what is now known as eulers theorem83 he contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers which had fascinated mathematicians since euclid he proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and mersenne primes which he had earlier proved was onetoone a result otherwise known as the euclideuler theorem84 euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity the concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem within number theory and his ideas paved the way for the work of carl friedrich gauss particularly disquisitiones arithmeticae85 by 1772 euler had proved that 231 1 2147483647 is a mersenne prime it may have remained the largest known prime until 186786 euler also contributed major developments to the theory of partitions of an integer87 in 1735 euler presented a solution to the problem known as the seven bridges of knigsberg88 the city of knigsberg prussia was set on the pregel river and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges the problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once euler showed that it is not possible there is no eulerian path this solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory88 euler also discovered the formula v e f 2 displaystyle vef2 relating the number of vertices edges and faces of a convex polyhedron89 and hence of a planar graph the constant in this formula is now known as the euler characteristic for the graph or other mathematical object and is related to the genus of the object90 the study and generalization of this formula specifically by cauchy91 and lhuilier92 is at the origin of topology89 some of eulers greatest successes were in solving realworld problems analytically and in describing numerous applications of the bernoulli numbers fourier series euler numbers the constants e and continued fractions and integrals he integrated leibnizs differential calculus with newtons method of fluxions and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems he made great strides in improving the numerical approximation of integrals inventing what are now known as the euler approximations the most notable of these approximations are eulers method93 and the eulermaclaurin formula949596 euler helped develop the eulerbernoulli beam equation which became a cornerstone of engineering97 besides successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics euler applied these techniques to celestial problems his work in astronomy was recognized by multiple paris academy prizes over the course of his career his accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies understanding the nature of comets and calculating the parallax of the sun his calculations contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables98 euler made important contributions in optics99 he disagreed with newtons corpuscular theory of light100 which was the prevailing theory of the time his 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by christiaan huygens would become the dominant mode of thought at least until the development of the quantum theory of light101 in fluid dynamics euler was the first to predict the phenomenon of cavitation in 1754 long before its first observation in the late 19th century and the euler number used in fluid flow calculations comes from his related work on the efficiency of turbines102 in 1757 he published an important set of equations for inviscid flow in fluid dynamics that are now known as the euler equations103 euler is well known in structural engineering for his formula giving eulers critical load the critical buckling load of an ideal strut which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness104 euler is credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning 1768 these diagrams have become known as euler diagrams105 an euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves usually circles in the plane that depict sets each euler curve divides the plane into two regions or zones the interior which symbolically represents the elements of the set and the exterior which represents all elements that are not members of the set the sizes or shapes of the curves are not important the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap the spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve overlap containment or neither corresponds to settheoretic relationships intersection subset and disjointness curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets the intersection of the sets a curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it euler diagrams and their refinement to venn diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s106 since then they have come into wide use as a way of visualizing combinations of characteristics107 one of eulers more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music in 1739 he wrote the tentamen novae theoriae musicae attempt at a new theory of music hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics this part of his work however did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians108 even when dealing with music eulers approach is mainly mathematical109 for instance his introduction of binary logarithms as a way of numerically describing the subdivision of octaves into fractional parts110 his writings on music are not particularly numerous a few hundred pages in his total production of about thirty thousand pages but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that remained with him throughout his life109 a first point of eulers musical theory is the definition of genres ie of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5 euler describes 18 such genres with the general definition 2ma where a is the exponent of the genre ie the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5 and 2m where m is an indefinite number small or large so long as the sounds are perceptible111 expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned the first genre with a 1 is the octave itself or its duplicates the second genre 2m3 is the octave divided by the fifth fifth fourth cgc the third genre is 2m5 major third minor sixth cec the fourth is 2m32 twofourths and a tone cfbc the fifth is 2m35 cegbc etc genres 12 2m335 13 2m3252 and 14 2m353 are corrected versions of the diatonic chromatic and enharmonic respectively of the ancients genre 18 2m3352 is the diatonicochromatic used generally in all compositions112 and which turns out to be identical with the system described by johann mattheson113 euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7114 euler devised a specific graph the speculum musicum115116 to illustrate the diatonicochromatic genre and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals recalling his interest in the seven bridges of knigsberg see above the device drew renewed interest as the tonnetz in neoriemannian theory see also lattice music117 euler further used the principle of the exponent to propose a derivation of the gradus suavitatis degree of suavity of agreeableness of intervals and chords from their prime factors one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation ie 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only118 formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers eg in the form d s i k i p i k i 1 displaystyle dssum ikipiki1 where pi are prime numbers and ki their exponents119 euler was religious throughout his life20 much of what is known of his religious beliefs can be deduced from his letters to a german princess and an earlier work rettung der gttlichen offenbahrung gegen die einwrfe der freygeister defense of the divine revelation against the objections of the freethinkers these show that euler was a devout christian who believed the bible to be inspired the rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture120121 euler opposed the concepts of leibnizs monadism and the philosophy of christian wolff122 he insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws something that monadism and wolffian science were unable to provide euler called wolffs ideas heathen and atheistic123 there is a legend124 inspired by eulers arguments with secular philosophers over religion which is set during eulers second stint at the st petersburg academy the french philosopher denis diderot was visiting russia on catherine the greats invitation the empress was alarmed that diderots arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court and so euler was asked to confront him diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of god he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court euler appeared advanced toward diderot and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non sequitur sir a b n n x displaystyle frac abnnx hence god exists reply diderot to whom says the story all mathematics was gibberish stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court embarrassed he asked to leave russia a request catherine granted however amusing the anecdote may be it is apocryphal given that diderot himself did research in mathematics125 the legend was apparently first told by dieudonn thibault with embellishment by augustus de morgan124 euler is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and more likely than not the most prolific contributor to mathematics and science8 mathematician and physicist john von neumann called euler the greatest virtuoso of the period126 mathematician franois arago said euler calculated without any apparent effort just as men breathe and as eagles sustain themselves in air127 he is generally ranked right below carl friedrich gauss isaac newton and archimedes among the greatest mathematicians of all time127 while some rank him as equal with them128 physicist and mathematician henri poincar called euler the god of mathematics129 french mathematician andr weil noted that euler stood above his contemporaries and more than anyone else was able to cement himself as the leading force of his eras mathematics126 no mathematician ever attained such a position of undisputed leadership in all branches of mathematics pure and applied as euler did for the best part of the eighteenth century swiss mathematician nicolas fuss noted eulers extraordinary memory and breadth of knowledge saying5 knowledge that we call erudition was not inimical to him he had read all the best roman writers knew perfectly the ancient history of mathematics held in his memory the historical events of all times and peoples and could without hesitation adduce by way of examples the most trifling of historical events he knew more about medicine botany and chemistry than might be expected of someone who had not worked especially in those sciences euler was featured on both the sixth130 and seventh131 series of the swiss 10franc banknote and on numerous swiss german and russian postage stamps in 1782 he was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences132 the asteroid 2002 euler was named in his honour133 euler has an extensive bibliography his books include it took until 1830 for the bulk of eulers posthumous works to be individually published140 with an additional batch of 61 unpublished works discovered by paul heinrich von fuss eulers greatgrandson and nicolas fusss son and published as a collection in 1862140141 a chronological catalog of eulers works was compiled by swedish mathematician gustaf enestrm and published from 1910 to 1913142 the catalog known as the enestrm index numbers eulers works from e1 to e866143 the euler archive was started at dartmouth college144 before moving to the mathematical association of america145 and most recently to university of the pacific in 2017146 in 1907 the swiss academy of sciences created the euler commission and charged it with the publication of eulers complete works after several delays in the 19th century140 the first volume of the opera omnia was published in 1911147 however the discovery of new manuscripts continued to increase the magnitude of this project fortunately the publication of eulers opera omnia has made steady progress with over 70 volumes averaging 426 pages each published by 2006 and 80 volumes published by 2022148116 these volumes are organized into four series the first series compiles the works on analysis algebra and number theory it consists of 29 volumes and numbers over 14000 pages the 31 volumes of series ii amounting to 10660 pages contain the works on mechanics astronomy and engineering series iii contains 12 volumes on physics series iv which contains the massive amount of eulers correspondence unpublished manuscripts and notes only began compilation in 1967 after publishing 8 print volumes in series iv the project decided in 2022 to publish its remaining projected volumes in series iv in online format only111476 higgins peter m 2007 nets puzzles and postmen an exploration of mathematical connections oxford university press p 43
