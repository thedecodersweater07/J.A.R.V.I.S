orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to rockets satellites and other spacecraft the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newtons laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation astrodynamics is a core discipline within spacemission design and control celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets moons and comets orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories including orbital maneuvers orbital plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers general relativity is a more exact theory than newtons laws for calculating orbits and it is sometimes necessary to use it for greater accuracy or in highgravity situations eg orbits near the sun until the rise of space travel in the twentieth century there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics at the time of sputnik the field was termed space dynamics1 the fundamental techniques such as those used to solve the keplerian problem determining position as a function of time are therefore the same in both fields furthermore the history of the fields is almost entirely shared johannes kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy publishing his laws in 1609 isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophi naturalis principia mathematica 1687 which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabolic path from three observations2 this was used by edmund halley to establish the orbits of various comets including that which bears his name newtons method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by leonhard euler in 1744 whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by johann lambert in 17611777 another milestone in orbit determination was carl friedrich gausss assistance in the recovery of the dwarf planet ceres in 1801 gausss method was able to use just three observations in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in gps receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets modern orbit determination and prediction are used to operate all types of satellites and space probes as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy astrodynamics was developed by astronomer samuel herrick beginning in the 1930s he consulted the rocket scientist robert goddard and was encouraged to continue his work on space navigation techniques as goddard believed they would be needed in the future numerical techniques of astrodynamics were coupled with new powerful computers in the 1960s and humans were ready to travel to the moon and return the following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun the consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counterintuitive for example if two spacecrafts are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to accelerate towards the leading craft this will change the shape of its orbit causing it to gain altitude and slow down relative to the leading craft thus moving away from the target the space rendezvous before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods requiring hours or even days to complete to the extent that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold actual trajectories will vary from those calculated for example simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low earth orbit these rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass such as a binary star system see nbody problem celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations keplers laws of planetary motion which can be mathematically derived from newtons laws hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of nongravitational forces they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important the fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newtons law of universal gravitation and newtons laws of motion while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus in a newtonian framework the laws governing orbits and trajectories are in principle timesymmetric standard assumptions in astrodynamics include noninterference from outside bodies negligible mass for one of the bodies and negligible other forces such as from the solar wind atmospheric drag etc more accurate calculations can be made without these simplifying assumptions but they are more complicated the increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile keplers laws of planetary motion may be derived from newtons laws when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor when an engine thrust or propulsive force is present newtons laws still apply but keplers laws are invalidated when the thrust stops the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by keplers laws which have been set out above the three laws are the formula for an escape velocity is derived as follows the specific energy energy per unit mass of any space vehicle is composed of two components the specific potential energy and the specific kinetic energy the specific potential energy associated with a planet of mass m is given by where g is the gravitational constant and r is the distance between the two bodies while the specific kinetic energy of an object is given by where v is its velocity and so the total specific orbital energy is since energy is conserved displaystyle epsilon cannot depend on the distance r displaystyle r from the center of the central body to the space vehicle in question ie v must vary with r to keep the specific orbital energy constant therefore the object can reach infinite r displaystyle r only if this quantity is nonnegative which implies the escape velocity from the earths surface is about 11 kms but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the sun to escape the solar system from a location at a distance from the sun equal to the distance sunearth but not close to the earth requires around 42 kms velocity but there will be partial credit for the earths orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from earth if their further acceleration due to the propulsion system carries them in the same direction as earth travels in its orbit orbits are conic sections so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in polar coordinates which is displaystyle mu is called the gravitational parameter m 1 displaystyle m1 and m 2 displaystyle m2 are the masses of objects 1 and 2 and h displaystyle h is the specific angular momentum of object 2 with respect to object 1 the parameter displaystyle theta is known as the true anomaly p displaystyle p is the semilatus rectum while e displaystyle e is the orbital eccentricity all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent orbital elements all bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature a special case of this is the circular orbit which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity the formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance r from the center of gravity of mass m can be derived as follows centrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity so v 2 r g m r 2 displaystyle frac v2rfrac gmr2 therefore where g displaystyle g is the gravitational constant equal to to properly use this formula the units must be consistent for example m displaystyle m must be in kilograms and r displaystyle r must be in meters the answer will be in meters per second the quantity g m displaystyle gm is often termed the standard gravitational parameter which has a different value for every planet or moon in the solar system once the circular orbital velocity is known the escape velocity is easily found by multiplying by 2 displaystyle sqrt 2 to escape from gravity the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy therefore 1 2 m v 2 g m m r displaystyle frac 12mv2frac gmmr if 0 e 1 displaystyle 0e1 then the denominator of the equation of free orbits varies with the true anomaly displaystyle theta but remains positive never becoming zero therefore the relative position vector remains bounded having its smallest magnitude at periapsis r p displaystyle rp which is given by the maximum value r displaystyle r is reached when 180 displaystyle theta 180circ this point is called the apoapsis and its radial coordinate denoted r a displaystyle ra is let 2 a displaystyle 2a be the distance measured along the apse line from periapsis p displaystyle p to apoapsis a displaystyle a as illustrated in the equation below substituting the equations above we get a is the semimajor axis of the ellipse solving for p displaystyle p and substituting the result in the conic section curve formula above we get under standard assumptions the orbital period t displaystyle t of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as where conclusions under standard assumptions the orbital speed v displaystyle v of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the visviva equation as where the velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory is v 2 r 1 a displaystyle vsqrt mu left2 over rleftvert 1 over arightvert right under standard assumptions specific orbital energy displaystyle epsilon of elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation the visviva equation for this orbit can take the form where conclusions using the virial theorem we find if the eccentricity equals 1 then the orbit equation becomes where as the true anomaly approaches 180 the denominator approaches zero so that r tends towards infinity hence the energy of the trajectory for which e1 is zero and is given by where in other words the speed anywhere on a parabolic path is if e 1 displaystyle e1 the orbit formula describes the geometry of the hyperbolic orbit the system consists of two symmetric curves the orbiting body occupies one of them the other one is its empty mathematical image clearly the denominator of the equation above goes to zero when cos 1 e displaystyle cos theta 1e we denote this value of true anomaly since the radial distance approaches infinity as the true anomaly approaches displaystyle theta infty known as the true anomaly of the asymptote observe that displaystyle theta infty lies between 90 and 180 from the trigonometric identity sin 2 cos 2 1 displaystyle sin 2theta cos 2theta 1 it follows that under standard assumptions specific orbital energy displaystyle epsilon of a hyperbolic trajectory is greater than zero and the orbital energy conservation equation for this kind of trajectory takes form where under standard assumptions the body traveling along a hyperbolic trajectory will attain at r displaystyle r infinity an orbital velocity called hyperbolic excess velocity v displaystyle vinfty that can be computed as where the hyperbolic excess velocity is related to the specific orbital energy or characteristic energy by one approach to calculating orbits mainly used historically is to use keplers equation where m is the mean anomaly e is the eccentric anomaly and displaystyle epsilon is the eccentricity with keplers formula finding the timeofflight to reach an angle true anomaly of displaystyle theta from periapsis is broken into two steps finding the eccentric anomaly at a given time the inverse problem is more difficult keplers equation is transcendental in e displaystyle e meaning it cannot be solved for e displaystyle e algebraically keplers equation can be solved for e displaystyle e analytically by inversion a solution of keplers equation valid for all real values of displaystyle textstyle epsilon is e n 1 m n 3 n lim 0 d n 1 d n 1 sin

displaystyle e as necessary to bring the computed timeofflight closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved usually newtons method is used to achieve relatively fast convergence the main difficulty with this approach is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits for nearparabolic orbits eccentricity displaystyle epsilon is nearly 1 and substituting e 1 displaystyle e1 into the formula for mean anomaly e sin e displaystyle esin e we find ourselves subtracting two nearlyequal values and accuracy suffers for nearcircular orbits it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all furthermore the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits these difficulties are what led to the development of the universal variable formulation described below for simple procedures such as computing the deltav for coplanar transfer ellipses traditional approachesclarification needed are fairly effective others such as timeofflight are far more complicated especially for nearcircular and hyperbolic orbits the hohmann transfer orbit alone is a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets own gravity planetary gravity dominates the behavior of the spacecraft in the vicinity of a planet and in most cases hohmann severely overestimates deltav and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings a relatively simple way to get a firstorder approximation of deltav is based on the patched conic approximation technique one must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass and to model only that bodys effects in that region for instance on a trajectory from the earth to mars one would begin by considering only the earths gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the earths gravity no longer dominates that of the sun the spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space next one would consider only the suns gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighborhood of mars during this stage the transfer orbit model is appropriate finally only marss gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where marss gravity dominates the spacecrafts behavior the spacecraft would approach mars on a hyperbolic orbit and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by mars friedrich zander was one of the first to apply the patchedconics approach for astrodynamics purposes when proposing the use of intermediary bodies gravity for interplanetary travels in what is known today as a gravity assist3 the size of the neighborhoods or spheres of influence vary with radius r s o i displaystyle rsoi where a p displaystyle ap is the semimajor axis of the planets orbit relative to the sun m p displaystyle mp and m s displaystyle ms are the masses of the planet and sun respectively this simplification is sufficient to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements and rough timeofflight estimates but it is not generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination for that numerical methods are required to address computational shortcomings of traditional approaches for solving the 2body problem the universal variable formulation was developed it works equally well for the circular elliptical parabolic and hyperbolic cases the differential equations converging well when integrated for any orbit it also generalizes well to problems incorporating perturbation theory the universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique except now instead of the six keplerian orbital elements we use a different set of orbital elements namely the satellites initial position and velocity vectors x 0 displaystyle x0 and v 0 displaystyle v0 at a given epoch t 0 displaystyle t0 in a twobody simulation these elements are sufficient to compute the satellites position and velocity at any time in the future using the universal variable formulation conversely at any moment in the satellites orbit we can measure its position and velocity and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch in perfect twobody motion these orbital elements would be invariant just like the keplerian elements would be however perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time hence the position element is written as x 0 t displaystyle x0t and the velocity element as v 0 t displaystyle v0t indicating that they vary with time the technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions either exact or approximate for the functions x 0 t displaystyle x0t and v 0 t displaystyle v0t the following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical earth most of them can be handled on short timescales perhaps less than a few thousand orbits by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding twobody effects over very long timescales perhaps millions of orbits even small perturbations can dominate and the behavior can become chaotic on the other hand the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks such as stationkeeping ground track maintenance or adjustment or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude in spaceflight an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft for spacecraft far from earthfor example those in orbits around the sunan orbital maneuver is called a deepspace maneuver dsmnot verified in body transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one usually substantially circular orbit to another usually they require a burn at the start a burn at the end and sometimes one or more burns in the middle for the case of orbital transfer between noncoplanar orbits the changeofplane thrust must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect the node as the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest however a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change this works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one resulting in the small plane change being effectively free despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse as the oberth effect due to the increased slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbitnormal axis in a gravity assist a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction at a different speed this is useful to speed or slow a spacecraft instead of carrying more fuel this maneuver can be approximated by an elastic collision at large distances though the flyby does not involve any physical contact due to newtons third law equal and opposite reaction any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet or vice versa however because the planet is much much more massive than the spacecraft the effect on the planets orbit is negligible the oberth effect can be employed particularly during a gravity assist operation this effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body this can multiply the effective deltav it is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the solar system for example it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars passing close to one of the earths trojan pointscitation needed collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network these highly perturbative even chaotic orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections the biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow taking many years in addition launch windows can be very far apart they have however been employed on projects such as genesis this spacecraft visited the earthsun l1 point and returned using very little propellant
