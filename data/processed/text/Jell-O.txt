sales steadily decreased many jello dishes such as desserts and jello salads became special occasion foods rather than everyday items marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes a fastpaced lifestyle and womens increasing employment by 1986 a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased jello7 to turn things around jello hired dana gioia to stop the

the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city the souvenir pins included one depicting green jello18 in the late 1980s and early 1990s jellos familyfriendly reputation was slightly tarnished by jello shots and jello wrestling7 as of 2011update there were over 420 million boxes of jello gelatin and over 1 billion jello cups sold in the united states each year19 as of 2016update there were more than 110 products sold under the jello brand name20 jello is used as a substantial ingredient in a wellknown dessert the jello mold which requires a mold designed to hold gelatin and the depositing of small quantities of chopped fruit nuts and other ingredients before it hardens to its typical form fresh pineapple papaya kiwifruit and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from setting in the case of pineapple juice and the enzyme bromelain that it contains though the enzyme can be inactivated without denaturing through excessive heating and thus altering the flavor by the addition of a small measured amount of capsaicin sourced from hot chilies21 an alternative recipe calls for the addition of an alcoholic beverage to the mix contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has dissolved in a boil22 a serving of the resulting mixture is called a jello shot or the genericized jello shot at parties the quantity and timing of the addition of the liquor are vital aspects it is not possible to make jello shots with liquor alone as the colloidal proteins in dry gelatin consist of chains which require a hot liquid to denature them before they can then reform as a semisolid colloidal suspension pure alcohol cannot be heated sufficiently to break down these proteins as it evaporates23 vodka or rum is commonly used in jello shots but the shots can be made with almost any liquor or blends of multiple liquors it is important to adjust the proportions of alcohol and cold water to ensure that the mixture sets when experimenting with various liquors the jello shots can be served in shot glasses or small paper or plastic cups the paper or plastic cups are easier to eat from but shot glasses are more attractive the alcohol in jello shots is contained within the jello so the body absorbs it more slowly causing people to underestimate how much alcohol they have consumed drinkers must monitor their intake because of this24 american singersongwriter tom lehrer claims to have invented the jello shot in the 1950s to circumvent restrictions on alcoholic beverages at the army base where he was stationed25 an early published recipe for an alcoholic gelatin drink dates from 1862 found in how to mix drinks or the bon vivants companion by jerry thomas his recipe for punch jelly calls for the addition of isinglass or other gelatin to a punch made from cognac rum and lemon juice2627 thomas warns that strength of the punch is artfully concealed by the gelatin26 as of 2012update leroy new york is known as the home of jello and has the only jello museum in the world located on the main road through the small town jello was manufactured here until general foods closed the plant in 1964
