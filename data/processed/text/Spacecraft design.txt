spacecraft design is a process where systems engineering principles are systemically applied in order to construct complex vehicles for missions involving travel operation or exploration in outer space this design process produces the detailed design specifications schematics and plans for the spacecraft system including comprehensive documentation outlining the spacecrafts architecture subsystems components interfaces and operational requirements and potentially some prototype models or simulations all of which taken together serve as the blueprint for manufacturing assembly integration and testing of the spacecraft to ensure that it meets mission objectives and performance criteria spacecraft design is conducted in several phases initially a conceptual design is made to determine the feasibility and desirability of a new spacecraft system showing that a credible design exists to carry out the mission the conceptual design review ensures that the design meets the mission statement without any technical flaws while being internally consistent next a preliminary design is carried out where the focus is on functional performance requirements definition and interface definition at both subsystem and system levels the preliminary design review evaluates the adequacy of the preliminary design in the following phase detailed design is drawn and coded for the system as a whole and all the subsystems and a critical design review is performed where it is evaluated whether the design is sufficiently detailed to fabricate integrate and test the system12 throughout spacecraft design potential risks are rigorously identified assessed and mitigated systems components are properly integrated and comprehensively tested the entire lifecycle including launch mission operations and endofmission disposal is taken into account an iterative process of reviews and testing is continuously employed to refine optimize and enhance the designs effectiveness and reliability in particular the spacecrafts mass power thermal control propulsion altitude control telecommunication command and data and structural aspects are taken into consideration choosing the right launch vehicle and adapting the design to the chosen launch vehicle is also important12 regulatory compliance adherence to international standards designing for a sustainable debrisfree space environment are some other considerations that have become important in recent times spacecraft design includes the design of both robotic spacecraft satellites and planetary probes and spacecraft for human spaceflight spaceships and space stations humancarrying spacecraft require additional lifesupport systems crew accommodation and safety measures to support human occupants as well as human factor engineering considerations such as ergonomics crew comfort and psychological wellbeing robotic spacecraft require autonomy reliability and remote operation capabilities without human presence the distinctive nature and the unique needs and constraints related to each of them significantly impact spacecraft design considerations recent developments in spacecraft design include electric propulsion systems eg ion thrusters and halleffect thrusters for highspecificimpulse propulsion solar sails using solar radiation pressure for continuous thrust without the need for traditional rockets3 additive manufacturing 3d printing and advanced materials eg advanced composites nanomaterials and smart materials for rapid prototyping and production of lightweight and durable components artificial intelligence and machine learningassisted autonomous systems for spacecraft autonomy and improved operational efficiency in long and faraway missions in situ resource utilization isru technologies for extraction and utilization of local resources on celestial bodies and cubesats and other standardized miniature satellites3 for costeffective space missions around earth spacecraft design involves experts from various fields such as engineering physics mathematics computer science etc who come together to collaborate and participate in interdisciplinary teamwork furthermore international collaboration and partnerships between space agencies organizations and countries help share expertise resources and capabilities for the mutual benefit of all parties the challenges of spacecraft design drive technological innovation and engineering breakthroughs in professional and industrial sectors the complexity of spacecraft design engages students in stem subjects science technology engineering and mathematics fosters scientific literacy and inspire the next generation of scientists engineers and innovators spacecraft design was born as a discipline in the 1950s and 60s with the advent of american and soviet space exploration programs since then it has progressed although typically less than comparable terrestrial technologies this is for a large part due to the challenging space environment but also to the lack of basic rd and other cultural factors within the design community on the other hand another reason for slow space travel application design is the high energy cost and low efficiency for achieving orbit this cost might be seen as too high a startup costcitation needed spacecraft design brings together aspects of various disciplines namelycitation needed the spacecraft bus carries the payload its subsystems support the payload and help in pointing the payload correctly it puts the payload in the right orbit and keeps it there it provides housekeeping functions it also provides orbit and attitude maintenance electric power command telemetry and data handling structure and rigidity temperature control data storage and communication if required the payload and spacecraft bus may be different units or it may be a combined one the booster adapter provides the loadcarrying interface with the vehicle payload and spacecraft bus together the spacecraft may also have a propellant load which is used to drive or push the vehicle upwards and a propulsion kick stage the propellant commonly used is a compressed gas like nitrogen a quid a such as monopropellant hydrazine or solid fuel which is used for velocity corrections and attitude control in a kick stage also called apogee boost motor propulsion module or integral propulsion stage a separate rocket motor is used to send the spacecraft into its mission orbit while designing a spacecraft the orbit which is going to be used should be considered into thnt as it affects attitude control thermal design and the electric power subsystem but these effects are secondary as compared to the effect caused on the payload due to the orbit thus while designing the mission the designer selects such an orbit which increases the payload performance the designer even calculates the required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing thermal control power quantity and duty cycle the spacecraft is then made which satisfies all the requirementscitation needed the attitude determination and control subsystem adcs is used to stabilize detumbling or change the attitude orientation of the spacecraft there are some external torques acting on the spacecraft along the axis passing through its center of gravity which can reorient the spacecraft in any direction or can give it a spin the adcs nullifies these torques by applying equal and opposite torques using the proion and navigation moment of inertia of the body is to be calculated to determine the external torques which also requires determination of vehicles absolute attitude using sensors the property called gyroscopic stiffness is used to reduce the spinning effect the simplest spacecraft achieve control by spinning or interacting with the earths magnetic or gravity fields sometimes they are uncontrolled spacecraft may have several bodies or they are attached to important parts such as solar arrays or communication antennas which need individual attitude pointing for controlling the appendages attitude actuators are often used with separate sensors and controllers the various types of control techniques used arecitation needed telemetry tracking and command ttc is used for communication between spacecraft and the ground systems the subsystem functions are the process of sending information towards the spacecraft is called uplink or forward link and the opposite process is called downlink or return link uplink consists of commands and ranging tones where as downlink consists of status telemetry ranging tones and even may include payload data receiver transmitter and a wideangle hemispheric or omnidirectional antenna are the main components of a basic communication subsystem systems with high data rates may even use a directional antenna if required the subsystem can provide us with the coherence between uplink and downlink signals with the help of which we can measure rangerate doppler shifts the communication subsystem is sized by data rate allowable error rate communication path length and rf frequency the vast majority of spacecraft communicate using radio antennas satellite communicationcitation needed a few spacecraft communicate using laserseither directly to the ground as with ladee or between satellites as with oicets artemis alphabus and the european data relay system the electrical power subsystem eps consists of 4 subunits thermal control subsystem tcs is used to maintain the temperature of all spacecraft components within certain limits both upper and lower limits are defined for each component there are two limits namely operational in working conditions and survival in nonworking conditions temperature is controlled by using insulators radiators heaters louvers and by giving proper surface finish to componentscitation needed the main function of the propulsion subsystem is to provide thrust so as to change the spacecrafts translational velocity or to apply torques to change its angular momentum there is no requirement of thrust and hence even no requirement of propulsion equipment in a simplest spacecraft but many of them need a controlled thrust in their system so their design includes some form of metered propulsion a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments thrusting is used for the following purposes for changing the orbital parameters to control attitude during thrusting correct velocity errors maneuver counter disturbance forces eg drag and control and correct angular momentum the propulsion subsystem includes a propellant tankage distribution system pressurant and propellant controls it also includes thrusters or engines spacecraft design is always informed by the particular mission architecture of the spaceflight under consideration typically a variety of mission architectures can be envisioned that would achieve the overall objective of the flight whether those objectives be to gather scientific data or merely transport cargo across the space environment to serve any variety of purposes governmental or economic4 spaceflight mission architectures will specify whether a spacecraft is to be autonomous or telerobotic or even be crewed so as to deal with particular exigencies or goals of the mission other considerations include fast or slow trajectories payload makeup and capacity length of the mission or the level of system redundancy so that the flight can achieve various degrees of faulttolerance4
