internet218 the kes goal was to be less reliant on traditional search engines it was funded with a 250000 grant from the knight foundation219 some perceived the project as a scandal mainly because it was conceived in secrecy and the project proposal was even a surprise to some staff in contrast with a general culture of transparency in the organization and on the projects some of the information available to the community was received through leaked documents published by the signpost in 2016220218 following this dispute executive director lila tretikov resigned221222223 in 2022 the wmf
