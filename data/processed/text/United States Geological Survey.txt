the united states geological survey usgs founded as the geological survey is an agency of the us department of the interior whose work spans the disciplines of biology geography geology and hydrology the agency was founded on march 3 1879 to study the landscape of the united states its natural resources and the natural hazards that threaten it the agency also makes maps of planets and moons based on data from us space probes the sole scientific agency of the us department of the interior usgs is a factfinding research organization with no regulatory responsibility2 it is headquartered in reston virginia with major offices near lakewood colorado at the denver federal center and in nasa research park in california3 in 2009 it employed about 8670 people4 the current motto of the usgs in use since august 1997 is science for a changing world56 the agencys previous slogan adopted on its hundredth anniversary was earth science in the public service7 since 2012 the usgs science focus has been directed at topical mission areas8 that have continued to evolve further organizational structure includes headquarters functions geographic regions science and support programs science centers labs and other facilities the usgs regional organization9 aligns with the us department of the interior unified interior regions10 usgs operates and organizes within a number of specific science programs facilities and other organizational units the earthquake hazards program11 monitors earthquake activity worldwide the national earthquake information center neic in golden colorado on the campus of the colorado school of mines detects the location and magnitude of global earthquakes the usgs also runs or supports several regional monitoring networks in the united states under the umbrella of the advanced national seismic system anss12 the usgs informs authorities emergency responders the media and the public both domestic and worldwide about significant earthquakes it maintains longterm archives of earthquake data for scientific and engineering research it also conducts and supports research on longterm seismic hazards usgs has released the ucerf california earthquake forecast13 as of 2005update the agency is working to create a national volcano early warning system by improving the instrumentation monitoring the 169 volcanoes in us territory and by establishing methods for measuring the relative threats posed at each site the usgs also operates five volcano observatories throughout the nation the alaska volcano observatory covering volcanoes in alaska and the northern mariana islands in anchorage alaska on the campus of alaska pacific university the california volcano observatory in menlo park california the cascades volcano observatory covering volcanoes in idaho oregon and washington in vancouver washington the hawaiian volcano observatory covering volcanoes in hawaii and american samoa in hilo hawaii and the yellowstone volcano observatory covering volcanoes in arizona colorado montana new mexico utah and wyoming in yellowstone national park wyoming14 the volcano disaster assistance program helps developing countries experiencing volcanic eruptions through response capacity building training and volcano research15 the program is based out of the cascades volcano observatory the usgs coastal and marine science center formerly the usgs center for coastal geology has three sites one for the atlantic ocean located in woods hole massachusetts one for the pacific ocean located in santa cruz california and one for the gulf of mexico located on the university of south floridas st petersburg campus the goal of this department is to conduct research in geology mapping hydrology biology and related sciences evaluate hazards associated with floods droughts hurricanes subsidence human activity and climate change map the onshore and offshore geologic framework assess mineral resources and develop techniques for their discovery assess water resources and develop an understanding of the impact of human activities and natural phenomena on hydrologic systems assess links between biodiversity habitat condition ecosystem processes and health and develop new technologies for collection and interpretation of earth science data16 the usgs national geomagnetism program monitors the magnetic field at magnetic observatories and distributes magnetometer data in real time the usgs collaborates with canadian and mexican government scientists along with the commission for environmental cooperation to produce the north american environmental atlas which is used to depict and track environmental issues for a continental perspective the usgs operates a number of waterrelated programs including as part of the water resources research act of 1984 the state water resources research act program created a water resources research institute wrri in each state along with washington dc puerto rico the us virgin islands and guam21 together these institutes make up the national institutes for water resources niwr the institutes focus on waterrelated issues through research training and collaboration22 the national and regional climate adaptation science centers cascs23 is a partnershipdriven program that teams scientific researchers with natural and cultural resource managers to help fish wildlife waters and lands across the country adapt to climate change the national casc ncasc based at usgs headquarters in reston virginia serves as the national office for the casc network while nine regional cascs comprising federaluniversity consortiums located across the us us pacific islands and us caribbean deliver science that addresses resource management priorities of the states within their footprints24 since 1962 the astrogeology research program has been involved in global lunar and planetary exploration and mapping in collaboration with stanford university the usgs operates the usgsstanford ion microprobe laboratory25 an analytical facility for uthpb geochronology and trace element analyses of minerals and other earth materials26 the usgs also operates the national wildlife health center whose mission is to serve the nation and its natural resources by providing sound science and technical support and to disseminate information to promote sciencebased decisions affecting wildlife and ecosystem health the nwhc provides information technical assistance research education and leadership on national and international wildlife health issues27 it is the agency primarily responsible for surveillance of h5n1 avian influenza outbreaks in the united states the usgs also runs 17 biological research centers in the united states including the patuxent wildlife research center the usgs is investigating collaboration with the social networking site twitter to allow for more rapid construction of shakemaps28 shakemaps are an interactive tool allowing users to visually observe the distribution and severity of shaking resulting from earthquakes29 the usgs produces several national series of topographic maps which vary in scale and extent with some wide gaps in coverage notably the absence of 150000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent the largest both in terms of scale and quantity and bestknown topographic series is the 75minute 124000 scale quadrangle a nonmetric scale most common to the united states each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude spaced 75 minutes apart nearly 57000 individual maps in this series cover the 48 contiguous states hawaii us territories and areas of alaska near anchorage fairbanks and prudhoe bay the area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians at lower latitudes near 30 north a 75minute quadrangle contains an area of about 64 square miles 166 km2 at 49 north latitude 49 square miles 127 km2 are contained within a quadrangle of that size as a unique nonmetric map scale the 124000 scale requires a separate and specialized romer scale for plotting map positions3031 the last usgs paper topographic maps were published in 2006 and were replaced by the national map32 in 201933 not to be confused with the national atlas of the united states produced by the department of the interior one of whose bureaus is usgs an older series of maps the 15minute series was once used to map the contiguous 48 states at a scale of 162500 for maps covering the continental united states but was discontinued during the last quarter of the twentieth century each map was bounded by two parallels and two meridians spaced 15 minutes apartthe same area covered by four maps in the 75minute series alaska formerly was mapped using the 15minute series which was replaced by maps at 125000 scale in 201734 nearly 3000 maps cover 97 of the state30 the final regular quadrangle series produced by the usgs is the 1250000 scale topographic series each of these quadrangles in the conterminous united states measures 1 degree of latitude by 2 degrees of longitude this series was produced by the us army map service in the 1950s prior to the maps in the largerscale series and consists of 489 sheets each covering an area ranging from 8218 square miles 21285 km2 at 30 north to 6222 square miles 16115 km2 at 49 north30 hawaii is mapped at this scale in quadrangles measuring 1 by 1 usgs topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods including the graticule measurements of longitude and latitude the township and section method within the public land survey system and cartesian coordinates in both the state plane coordinate system and the universal transverse mercator coordinate system other specialty maps have been produced by the usgs at a variety of scales these include county maps maps of special interest areas such as the national parks and areas of scientific interest a number of internet sites have made these maps available on the web for affordable commercial and professional use because works of the us government are in the public domain it is also possible to find many of these maps for free at various locations on the internet georeferenced map images are available from the usgs as digital raster graphics drgs in addition to digital data sets based on usgs maps notably digital line graphs dlgs and digital elevation models dems in 2015 the usgs unveiled the topoview website a new way to view their entire digitized collection of over 178000 maps from 1884 to 2006 the site is an interactive map of the united states that allows users to search or move around the map to find the usgs collection of maps for a specific area users may then view the maps in great detail and download them if desired35 in 2008 the usgs abandoned traditional methods of surveying revising and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks36 todays us topo quadrangle 124000 maps are massproduced using automated and semiautomated processes with cartographic content supplied from the national gis database36 in the two years from june 2009 to may 2011 the usgs produced nearly 40000 maps more than 80 maps per work day36 only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map mostly on text placement and final inspection there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details36 while much less expensive to compile and produce the revised digital us topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo surveys and field checks36 as the digital databases were not designed for producing generalpurpose maps data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates36 humanmade features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps including windmills mines and mineshafts water tanks fence lines survey marks parks recreational trails buildings boundaries pipelines telephone lines power transmission lines and even railroads37 as a result some have noted that the us topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945 to 199236 the hydrologic instrumentation facility hif has four sections within its organizational structure38 the field services section which includes the warehouse repair shop and engineering unit the testing section which includes the hydraulic laboratory testing chambers and water quality laboratory the information technology section which includes computer support and the drafting unit and the administrative section the hif was given national responsibility for the design testing evaluation repair calibration warehousing and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program the hif supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities the hif warehouse provides hydrologic instruments equipment and supplies for usgs as well as other federal agencies ofa and usgs cooperators the hif also tests evaluates repairs calibrates and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments the hif hydraulic laboratory facilities include a towing tank jet tank pipe flow facility and tilting flume in addition the hif provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks the engineering group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently be more accurate and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation hif works directly with vendors to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the usgs for instrument needs not currently met by a vendor the engineering group designs tests and issues contracts to have hifdesigned equipment made sometimes hif will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and massproduce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone usgs researchers publish the results of their science in a variety of ways including peerreviewed scientific journals as well as in one of a variety of usgs report series39 that include preliminary results maps data and final results a complete catalog of all usgs publications is available from the usgs publications warehouse40 in the mid1800s various states set up geological survey institutions eg the kentucky geological survey established in 185441 501 in 1879 a report from the national academy of sciences prompted congress to set up a federal survey agency in part to inventory the vast lands added to the united states by the louisiana purchase in 1803 and the mexicanamerican war in 1848 the usgs was authorized on march 3 in a lastminute amendment to an unrelated bill that charged the new agency with the classification of the public lands and examination of the geological structure mineral resources and products of the national domain the legislation also provided that the hayden powell and wheeler surveys be discontinued as of june 30 187942 clarence king the first director of usgs assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies after two years king was succeeded by john wesley powell
