the epicenter psntr epicentre or epicentrum1 in seismology is the point on the earths surface directly above a hypocenter or focus the point where an earthquake or an underground explosion originates the primary purpose of a seismometer is to locate the initiating points of earthquake epicenters the secondary purpose of determining the size or magnitude must be calculated after the precise location is knowncitation needed the earliest seismographs were designed to give a sense of the direction of the first motions from an earthquake the chinese frog seismograph2 would have dropped its ball in the general compass direction of the earthquake assuming a strong positive pulse we now know that first motions can be in almost any direction depending on the type of initiating rupture focal mechanism3 the first refinement that allowed a more precise determination of the location was the use of a time scale instead of merely noting or recording the absolute motions of a pendulum the displacements were plotted on a moving graph driven by a clock mechanism this was the first seismogram which allowed precise timing of the first ground motion and an accurate plot of subsequent motions from the first seismograms as seen in the figure it was noticed that the trace was divided into two major portions the first seismic wave to arrive was the p wave followed closely by the s wave knowing the relative velocities of propagation it was a simple matter to calculate the distance of the earthquake4 one seismograph would give the distance but that could be plotted as a circle with an infinite number of possibilities two seismographs would give two intersecting circles with two possible locations only with a third seismograph would there be a precise location modern earthquake location still requires a minimum of three seismometers most likely there are many forming a seismic array the emphasis is on precision since much can be learned about the fault mechanics and seismic hazard if the locations can be determined to be within a kilometer or two for small earthquakes for this computer programs use an iterative process involving a guess and correction algorithm5 as well a very good model of the local crustal velocity structure is required seismic velocities vary with the local geology for p waves the relation between velocity and bulk density of the medium has been quantified in gardners relation before the instrumental period of earthquake observation the epicenter was thought to be the location where the greatest damage occurred6 but the subsurface fault rupture may be long and spread surface damage across the entire rupture zone as an example in the magnitude 79 denali earthquake of 2002 in alaska the epicenter was at the western end of the rupture but the greatest damage was about 330 km 210 mi away at the eastern end7 focal depths of earthquakes occurring in continental crust mostly range from 2 to 20 kilometers 12 to 124 mi8 continental earthquakes below 20 km 12 mi are rare whereas in subduction zone earthquakes can originate at depths deeper than 600 km 370 mi8 during an earthquake seismic waves propagates in all directions from the hypocenter seismic shadowing occurs on the opposite side of the earth from the earthquake epicenter because the planets liquid outer core refracts the longitudinal or compressional p waves while it absorbs the transverse or shear waves s waves outside the seismic shadow zone both types of wave can be detected but because of their different velocities and paths through the earth they arrive at different times by measuring the time difference on any seismograph and the distance on a traveltime graph on which the p wave and s wave have the same separation geologists can calculate the distance to the quakes epicenter this distance is called the epicentral distance commonly measured in degrees and denoted as delta in seismology the lskas empirical rule provides an approximation of epicentral distance in the range of 200010000 km once distances from the epicenter have been calculated from at least three seismographic measuring stations the point can be located using trilateration epicentral distance is also used in calculating seismic magnitudes as developed by richter and gutenberg910 the point at which fault slipping begins is referred to as the focus of the earthquake8 the fault rupture begins at the focus and then expands along the fault surface the rupture stops where the stresses become insufficient to continue breaking the fault because the rocks are stronger or where the rupture enters ductile material8 the magnitude of an earthquake is related to the total area of its fault rupture8 most earthquakes are small with rupture dimensions less than the depth of the focus so the rupture doesnt break the surface but in high magnitude destructive earthquakes surface breaks are common8 fault ruptures in large earthquakes can extend for more than 100 km 62 mi8 when a fault ruptures unilaterally with the epicenter at or near the end of the fault break the waves are stronger in one direction along the fault11 the macroseismic epicenter is the best estimate of the location of the epicenter derived without instrumental data this may be estimated using intensity data information about foreshocks and aftershocks knowledge of local fault systems or extrapolations from data regarding similar earthquakes for historical earthquakes that have not been instrumentally recorded only a macroseismic epicenter can be given12 the word is derived from the neolatin noun epicentrum13 the latinisation of the ancient greek adjective epikentros occupying a cardinal point situated on a centre14 from epi on upon at15 and kentron centre16 the term was coined by irish seismologist robert mallet17 it is also used to mean center of activity as in travel is restricted in the chinese province thought to be the epicentre of the sars outbreak1819 garners modern american usage gives several examples of use in which epicenter is used to mean center garner also refers to a william safire article in which safire quotes a geophysicist as attributing the use of the term to spurious erudition on the part of writers combined with scientific illiteracy on the part of copy editors20 garner has speculated that these misuses may just be metaphorical descriptions of focal points of unstable and potentially destructive environments21
