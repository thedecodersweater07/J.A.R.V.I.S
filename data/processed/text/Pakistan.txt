encompassing presentday pakistan28 the earliest known stone tools in the region dating to the lower palaeolithic 2 million years ago were discovered in the soan valley of northern pakistan29 the indus region which covers most of the presentday pakistan was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the neolithic 70004300 bce site of mehrgarh303132 and the 5000year history of urban life in south asia to the various sites of the indus valley civilisation including mohenjodaro and harappa3334 following the decline of the indus valley civilization indoaryan tribes moved into the punjab from central asia in several waves of migration in the vedic period 1500500 bce35 bringing with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture36 the indoaryans religious beliefs and practices from the bactriamargiana culture and the native harappan indus beliefs of the former indus valley civilization eventually gave rise to vedic culture and tribes36 most notable among them was gandhara civilization which flourished at the crossroads of india central asia and the middle east connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations37 the initial early vedic culture was a tribal pastoral society centered in the indus valley of what is today pakistan38 during this period the vedas the oldest scriptures of hinduism were composed39g the western regions of pakistan became part of achaemenid empire around 517 bce41 in 326 bce alexander the great conquered the region by defeating various local rulers most

the early medieval period 6421219 ce witnessed the spread of islam in the region56 before the arrival of islam beginning in the 8th century the region of pakistan was home to a diverse plethora of faiths including hinduism buddhism jainism and zoroastrianism5758 during this period sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to islam59 upon the defeat of the turk and hindu shahi dynasties which governed the kabul valley gandhara and western punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries ce several successive muslim empires ruled over the region including the ghaznavid empire 9751187 ce the ghorid kingdom and the delhi sultanate 12061526 ce60 the lodi dynasty the last of the delhi sultanate was replaced by the mughal empire 15261857 ce61 the mughals introduced persian literature and high culture establishing the roots of indopersian culture in the region63 in the region of modernday pakistan key cities during the mughal period were multan lahore peshawar and thatta64 which were chosen as the site of impressive mughal buildings65 in the early 16th century the region remained under the mughal empire66 in the 18th century the slow disintegration of the mughal empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers like the maratha empire and later the sikh empire as well as invasions by nader shah from iran in 1739 and the durrani empire of afghanistan in 1759767 the growing political power of the british in bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern pakistan68 none of modern pakistan was under british rule until 1839 when karachi a small fishing village governed by talpurs of sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour was taken7374 and used as an enclave with a port and military base for the first afghan war that ensued75 the remainder of sindh was acquired in 184376 and subsequently through a series of wars and treaties the east india company and later after the postsepoy mutiny 18571858 direct rule by queen victoria of the british empire acquired most of the region77 key conflicts included those against the baloch talpur dynasty resolved by the battle of miani 1843 in sindh78 the anglosikh wars 1845184979 and the angloafghan wars 1839191980 by 1893 all modern pakistan was part of the british indian empire and remained so until independence in 194781 under british rule modern pakistan was primarily divided into the sind division punjab province and the baluchistan agency the region also included various princely states with the largest being bahawalpur8283 the major armed struggle against the british in the region was the rebellion known as the sepoy mutiny in 185784 divergence in the relationship between hinduism and islam resulted in significant tension in british india leading to religious violence the language controversy further exacerbated tensions between hindus and muslims7185 a muslim intellectual movement led by sir syed ahmed khan to counter the hindu renaissance advocated for the twonation theory and led to the establishment of the allindia muslim league in 1906697071 in march 1929 in response to the nehru report muhammad ali jinnah the founder of pakistan issued his fourteen points which included proposals to safeguard the interests of the muslim minority in a united india these proposals were rejected868788 in his 29 december 1930 address allama iqbal advocated the amalgamation of muslimmajority states in northwest india including punjab northwest frontier province sind and baluchistan8889 the perception that congressled british provincial governments neglected the muslim league from 1937 to 1939 motivated jinnah and other muslim league leaders to embrace the twonation theory9091 this led to the adoption of the lahore resolution of 1940 presented by sherebangla ak fazlul haque also known as the pakistan resolution92 by 1942 britain faced considerable strain during world war ii with india directly threatened by japanese forces britain had pledged voluntary independence for india in exchange for support during the war however this pledge included a clause stating that no part of british india would be compelled to join the resulting dominion which could be interpreted as support for an independent muslim nation congress under the leadership of mahatma gandhi launched the quit india movement demanding an immediate end to british rule in contrast the muslim league chose to support the uks war efforts thereby nurturing the possibility of establishing a muslim nation9394 the 1946 elections saw the muslim league secure 90 percent of the muslim seats supported by the landowners of sindh and punjab this forced the indian national congress initially skeptical of the leagues representation of indian muslims to acknowledge its significance95 jinnahs emergence as the voice of the indian muslims55 compelled the british to consider their stance despite their reluctance to partition india in a final attempt to prevent partition they proposed the cabinet mission plan96 as the cabinet mission failed the british announced their intention to end rule by june 19489798 following rigorous discussions involving viceroy of india lord mountbatten of burma muhammad ali jinnah of the allindia muslim league and jawaharlal nehru of congress the formal declaration to partition british india into two independent dominionsnamely pakistan and indiawas issued by mountbatten on the evening of 3 june 1947 in mountbattens oval office the prime ministers of around a dozen major princely states gathered to receive their copies of the plan before its worldwide broadcast at 700 pm all india radio transmitted the public announcement starting with the viceroys address followed by individual speeches from nehru and jinnah the founder of pakistan muhammad ali jinnah concluded his address with the slogan pakistan zindabad long live pakistan99 as the united kingdom agreed to the partitioning of india99 the modern state of pakistan was established on 14 august 1947 27th of ramadan in 1366 of the islamic calendar considered to be the most blessed date from an islamic perspective100101 this new nation amalgamated the muslimmajority eastern and northwestern regions of british india comprising the provinces of balochistan east bengal the northwest frontier province west punjab and sindh102 in the riots that accompanied the partition in punjab province between 200000 and 2000000 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions103 around 50000 muslim women were abducted and raped by hindu and sikh men while 33000 hindu and sikh women experienced the same fate at the hands of muslims104 around 65 million muslims moved from india to west pakistan and 47 million hindus and sikhs moved from west pakistan to india105 it was the largest mass migration in human history106 a subsequent dispute over the princely state of jammu and kashmir eventually sparked the indopakistani war of 19471948107 after independence in 1947 jinnah the president of the muslim league became pakistans first governorgeneral and the first presidentspeaker of the parliament but he succumbed to tuberculosis on 11 september 1948109110 meanwhile pakistans founding fathers agreed to appoint liaquat ali khan the secretarygeneral of the party the nations first prime minister108109 from 1947 to 1956 pakistan was a monarchy within the commonwealth of nations and had two monarchs before it became a republic111 the creation of pakistan was never fully accepted by many british leaders including lord mountbatten112 mountbatten expressed his lack of support and faith in the muslim leagues idea of pakistan113 jinnah refused mountbattens offer to serve as governorgeneral of pakistan114 when mountbatten was asked by collins and lapierre if he would have sabotaged pakistan had he known that jinnah was dying of tuberculosis he replied most probably115 you are free you are free to go to your temples you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this state of pakistan you may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state maulana shabbir ahmad usmani a respected deobandi alim scholar who held the position of shaykh alislam in pakistan in 1949 and maulana mawdudi of jamaatiislami played key roles in advocating for an islamic constitution mawdudi insisted that the constituent assembly declare the supreme sovereignty of god and the supremacy of the shariah in pakistan117 the efforts of jamaatiislami and the ulama led to the passage of the objectives resolution in march 1949 this resolution described by liaquat ali khan as the second most significant step in pakistans history affirmed that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to god almighty alone and the authority which he has delegated to the state of pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by him is a sacred trust it was later included as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956 1962 and 1973118 democracy faced setbacks due to the martial law imposed by president iskander mirza who was succeeded by general ayub khan after adopting a presidential system in 1962 pakistan witnessed significant growth until the second war with india in 1965 resulting in an economic downturn and widespread public discontent in 1967119120 in 1969 president yahya khan consolidated control but faced a devastating cyclone in east pakistan resulting in 500000 deaths121 in 1970 pakistan conducted its first democratic elections since independence intending to transition from military rule to democracy however after the east pakistani awami league emerged victorious over the pakistan peoples party ppp yahya khan and the military refused to transfer power122 this led to operation searchlight a military crackdown and eventually sparked the war of liberation by bengali mukti bahini forces in east pakistan123 described in west pakistan as a civil war rather than a liberation struggle124 independent researchers estimate that between 300000 and 500000 civilians died during this period while the bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million126 a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated127 some academics such as rudolph rummel and rounaq jahan say both sides committed genocide128 others such as richard sisson and leo e rose believe there was no genocide129 in response to indias support for the insurgency in east pakistan preemptive strikes on india by pakistans air force navy and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an indian victory and east pakistan gaining independence as bangladesh130 yahya khan was replaced by zulfikar ali bhutto as president the country worked towards promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to democracy131132 in 1972 pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any foreign invasion the countrys first nuclear power plant was inaugurated in that same year133134 indias first nuclear test in 1974 gave pakistan additional justification to accelerate its nuclear program134 democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist ppp which saw general ziaulhaq become the president in 1978135 from 1977 to 1988 president zias corporatisation and economic islamisation initiatives led to pakistan becoming one of the

distribute us resources to factions of the mujahideen against the ussrs intervention in communist afghanistan137138139 pakistans northwest frontier province became a base for the antisoviet afghan fighters with the provinces influential deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the jihad140 president zia died in a plane crash in 1988 and benazir bhutto daughter of zulfikar ali bhutto was elected as the countrys first female prime minister the ppp was followed by conservative pakistan muslim league n pml n and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power alternating in office141 this period is marked by prolonged stagflation political instability corruption misgovernment geopolitical rivalry with india and the clash of left wingright wing ideologies142143 as pml n secured a supermajority in elections in 1997144 nawaz sharif authorised nuclear testings as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests conducted by india in may 1998145
