an inertial navigation system ins also inertial guidance system inertial instrument is a navigation device that uses motion sensors accelerometers rotation sensors gyroscopes and a computer to continuously calculate by dead reckoning the position the orientation and the velocity direction and speed of movement of a moving object without the need for external references1 often the inertial sensors are supplemented by a barometric altimeter and sometimes by magnetic sensors magnetometers andor speed measuring devices inss are used on mobile robots23 and on vehicles such as ships aircraft submarines guided missiles and spacecraft4 older ins systems generally used an inertial platform as their mounting point to the vehicle and the terms are sometimes considered synonymous inertial navigation is a selfcontained navigation technique in which measurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the position and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point orientation and velocity inertial measurement units imus typically contain three orthogonal rategyroscopes and three orthogonal accelerometers measuring angular velocity and linear acceleration respectively by processing signals from these devices it is possible to track the position and orientation of a device an inertial navigation system includes at least a computer and a platform or module containing accelerometers gyroscopes or other motionsensing devices the ins is initially provided with its position and velocity from another source a human operator a gps satellite receiver etc accompanied with the initial orientation and thereafter computes its own updated position and velocity by integrating information received from the motion sensors the advantage of an ins is that it requires no external references in order to determine its position orientation or velocity once it has been initialized an ins can detect a change in its geographic position a move east or north for example a change in its velocity speed and direction of movement and a change in its orientation rotation about an axis it does this by measuring the linear acceleration and angular velocity applied to the system since it requires no external reference after initialization it is immune to jamming and deception gyroscopes measure the angular displacement of the sensor frame with respect to the inertial reference frame by using the original orientation of the system in the inertial reference frame as the initial condition and integrating the angular displacement the systems current orientation is known at all times this can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel the car turn left and right or tilt up and down as the car ascends or descends hills based on this information alone the passenger knows what direction the car is facing but not how fast or slow it is moving or whether it is sliding sideways accelerometers measure the linear acceleration of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame but in directions that can only be measured relative to the moving system since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system but are not aware of their own orientation this can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel themself pressed back into their seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down and feel themself pressed down into their seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as the car passes over the crest of a hill and begins to descend based on this information alone they know how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself that is whether it is accelerating forward backward left right up toward the cars ceiling or down toward the cars floor measured relative to the car but not the direction relative to the earth since they did not know what direction the car was facing relative to the earth when they felt the accelerations however by tracking both the current angular velocity of the system and the current linear acceleration of the system measured relative to the moving system it is possible to determine the linear acceleration of the system in the inertial reference frame performing integration on the inertial accelerations using the original velocity as the initial conditions using the correct kinematic equations yields the inertial velocities of the system and integration again using the original position as the initial condition yields the inertial position in our example if the blindfolded passenger knew how the car was pointed and what its velocity was before they were blindfolded and if they are able to keep track of both how the car has turned and how it has accelerated and decelerated since then they can accurately know the current orientation position and velocity of the car at any time inertial navigation is used in a wide range of applications including the navigation of aircraft tactical and strategic missiles spacecraft submarines and ships it is also embedded in some mobile phones for purposes of mobile phone location and tracking56 recent advances in the construction of microelectromechanical systems mems have made it possible to manufacture small and light inertial navigation systems these advances have widened the range of possible applications to include areas such as human and animal motion capture inertial navigation systems are used in many different moving objects however their cost and complexity place constraints on the environments in which they are practical for use to support the use of inertial technology in the best way already in 1965 a technical working group for inertial sensors had been established in germany to bring together the users the manufacturers and the researchers of inertial sensors this working group has been continuously developed and today it is known as dgon isa inertial sensors and application symposium the leading conference for inertial technologies for more than 60 years this symposium dgon ieee isa with about 200 international attendees is held annually in october in germany the publications of all dgon isa conferences over the last more than 60 years are accessible all inertial navigation systems suffer from integration drift small errors in the measurement of acceleration and angular velocity are integrated into progressively larger errors in velocity which are compounded into still greater errors in position78 since the new position is calculated from the previous calculated position and the measured acceleration and angular velocity these errors accumulate roughly proportionally to the time since the initial position was input even the best accelerometers with a standard error of 10 microg would accumulate a 50meter 164ft error within 17 minutes9 therefore the position must be periodically corrected by input from some other type of navigation system accordingly inertial navigation is usually used to supplement other navigation systems providing a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with the use of any single system for example if in terrestrial use the inertially tracked velocity is intermittently updated to zero by stopping the position will remain precise for a much longer time a socalled zero velocity update in aerospace particularly other measurement systems are used to determine ins inaccuracies eg the honeywell laserefv inertial navigation systems uses gps and air data computer outputs to maintain required navigation performance the navigation error rises with the lower sensitivity of the sensors used currently devices combining different sensors are being developed eg attitude and heading reference system because the navigation error is mainly influenced by the numerical integration of angular rates and accelerations the pressure reference system was developed to use one numerical integration of the angular rate measurements estimation theory in general and kalman filtering in particular10 provide a theoretical framework for combining information from various sensors one of the most common alternative sensors is a satellite navigation radio such as gps which can be used for all kinds of vehicles with direct sky visibility indoor applications can use pedometers distance measurement equipment or other kinds of position sensors by properly combining the information from an ins and other systems gps the errors in position and velocity are stable furthermore ins can be used as a shortterm fallback while gps signals are unavailable for example when a vehicle passes through a tunnel in 2011 gps jamming at the civilian level became a governmental concern11 the relative ease in ability to jam these systems has motivated the military to reduce navigation dependence on gps technology12 because inertial navigation sensors do not depend on radio signals unlike gps they cannot be jammed13 in 2012 the us army research laboratory reported a method to merge measurements from 10 pairs of mems gyroscope and accelerometers plus occasional gps reducing the positional error by two thirds for a projectile the algorithm can correct for systemic biases in individual sensors using both gps and a heuristic based on the gunfiring acceleration force if one sensor consistently over or underestimates distance the system can adjust the corrupted sensors contributions to the final calculation14 inertial navigation systems were originally developed for rockets american rocketry pioneer robert goddard experimented with rudimentary gyroscopic systems goddards systems were of great interest to contemporary german pioneers including wernher von braun the systems entered more widespread use with the advent of spacecraft guided missiles and commercial airliners early german world war ii v2 guidance systems combined two gyroscopes and a lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight analog computer signals were used to drive four graphite rudders in the rocket exhaust for flight control the gnc guidance navigation and control system for the v2 provided many innovations as an integrated platform with closed loop guidance at the end of the war von braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists along with plans and test vehicles to the americans they arrived at fort bliss texas in 1945 under the provisions of operation paperclip and were subsequently moved to huntsville alabama in 195015 where they worked for us army rocket research programs in the early 1950s the us government wanted to insulate itself against overdependency on the german team for military applications including the development of a fully domestic missile guidance program the mit instrumentation laboratory later to become the charles stark draper laboratory inc was chosen by the air force western development division to provide a selfcontained guidance system backup to convair in san diego for the new atlas intercontinental ballistic missile 16171819 construction and testing were completed by arma division of ambosch arma the technical monitor for the mit task was engineer jim fletcher who later served as nasa administrator the atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an onboard autonomous system and a groundbased tracking and command system the selfcontained system finally prevailed in ballistic missile applications for obvious reasons in space exploration a mixture of the two remains in the summer of 1952 dr richard battin and dr j halcombe hal laning jr researched computational based solutions to guidance and undertook the initial analytical work on the atlas inertial guidance in 1954 other key figures at convair were charlie bossart the chief engineer and walter schweidetzky head of the guidance group schweidetzky had worked with von braun at peenemnde during world war ii the initial delta guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory a velocity to be gained vgo calculation is made to correct the current trajectory with the objective of driving vgo to zero the mathematics of this approach were fundamentally valid but dropped because of the challenges in accurate inertial guidance and analog computing power the challenges faced by the delta efforts were overcome by the q system see qguidance of guidance the q systems revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance and associated equations of motion in the matrix q the q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector a key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product v xdv dt to be used as the basic autopilot rate signalsa technique that became known as crossproduct steering the qsystem was presented at the first technical symposium on ballistic missiles held at the ramowooldridge corporation in los angeles on 21 and 22 june 1956 the q system was classified information through the 1960s derivations of this guidance are used for todays missiles in february 1961 nasa awarded mit a contract for preliminary design study of a guidance and navigation system for the apollo program mit and the delco electronics div of general motors corp were awarded the joint contract for design and production of the apollo guidance and navigation systems for the command module and the lunar module delco produced the imus inertial measurement units for these systems kollsman instrument corp produced the optical systems and the apollo guidance computer was built by raytheon under subcontract2021 for the space shuttle open loop guidance was used to guide the shuttle from liftoff until solid rocket booster srb separation after srb separation the primary space shuttle guidance is named peg powered explicit guidance peg takes into account both the q system and the predictorcorrector attributes of the original delta system peg guidance although many updates to the shuttles navigation system had taken place over the last 30 years ex gps in the oi22 build the guidance core of the shuttle gnc system had evolved little within a crewed system there is a human interface needed for the guidance system as astronauts are the customer for the system many new teams were formed that touch gnc as it is a primary interface to fly the vehicle one example of a popular ins for commercial aircraft was the delco carousel which provided partial automation of navigation in the days before complete flight management systems became commonplace the carousel allowed pilots to enter 9 waypoints at a time and then guided the aircraft from one waypoint to the next using an ins to determine aircraft position and velocity boeing corporation subcontracted the delco electronics div of general motors to design and build the first production carousel systems for the early models 100 200 and 300 of the 747 aircraft the 747 utilized three carousel systems operating in concert for reliability purposes the carousel system and derivatives thereof were subsequently adopted for use in many other commercial and military aircraft the usaf c141 was the first military aircraft to utilize the carousel in a dual system configuration followed by the c5a which utilized the triple ins configuration similar to the 747 the kc135a fleet was fitted with a single carousel ive system that could operate as a standalone ins or can be aided by the anapn81 or anapn218 doppler radar some specialmission variants of the c135 were fitted with dual carousel ive inss arinc characteristic 704 defines the ins used in commercial air transport inss contain inertial measurement units imus which have angular and linear accelerometers for changes in position some imus include a gyroscopic element for maintaining an absolute angular reference angular accelerometers measure how the vehicle is rotating in space generally there is at least one sensor for each of the three axes pitch nose up and down yaw nose left and right and roll clockwise or counterclockwise from the cockpit linear accelerometers measure nongravitational accelerations22 of the vehicle since it can move in three axes up and down left and right forward and back there is a linear accelerometer for each axis a computer continually calculates the vehicles current position first for each of the six degrees of freedom xyz and x y and z it integrates over time the sensed acceleration together with an estimate of gravity to calculate the current velocity then it integrates the velocity to calculate the current position inertial guidance is difficult without computers the desire to use inertial guidance in the minuteman missile and project apollo drove early attempts to miniaturize computers inertial guidance systems are now usually combined with satellite navigation systems through a digital filtering system the inertial system provides short term data while the satellite system corrects accumulated errors of the inertial system an inertial guidance system that will operate near the surface of the earth must incorporate schuler tuning so that its platform will continue pointing towards the center of the earth as a vehicle moves from place to place some systems place the linear accelerometers on a gimballed gyrostabilized platform the gimbals are a set of three rings each with a pair of bearings initially at right angles they let the platform twist about any rotational axis or rather they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it there are two gyroscopes usually on the platform two gyroscopes are used to cancel gyroscopic precession the tendency of a gyroscope to twist at right angles to an input torque by mounting a pair of gyroscopes of the same rotational inertia and spinning at the same speed in opposite directions at right angles the precessions are cancelled and the platform will resist twisting citation needed this system allows a vehicles roll pitch and yaw angles to be measured directly at the bearings of the gimbals relatively simple electronic circuits can be used to add up the linear accelerations because the directions of the linear accelerometers do not change the big disadvantage of this scheme is that it uses many expensive precision mechanical parts it also has moving parts that can wear out or jam and is vulnerable to gimbal lock the primary guidance system of the apollo spacecraft used a threeaxis gyrostabilized platform feeding data to the apollo guidance computer maneuvers had to be carefully planned to avoid gimbal lock gimbal lock constrains maneuvering and it would be beneficial to eliminate the slip rings and bearings of the gimbals therefore some systems use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber to mount a gyrostabilized platform these systems can have very high precisions eg advanced inertial reference sphere like all gyrostabilized platforms this system runs well with relatively slow lowpower computers the fluid bearings are pads with holes through which pressurized inert gas such as helium or oil presses against the spherical shell of the platform the fluid bearings are very slippery and the spherical platform can turn freely there are usually four bearing pads mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform in premium systems the angular sensors are usually specialized transformer coils made in a strip on a flexible printed circuit board several coil strips are mounted on great circles around the spherical shell of the gyrostabilized platform electronics outside the platform uses similar stripshaped transformers to read the varying magnetic fields produced by the transformers wrapped around the spherical platform whenever a magnetic field changes shape or moves it will cut the wires of the coils on the external transformer strips the cutting generates an electric current in the external stripshaped coils and electronics can measure that current to derive angles cheap systems sometimes use bar codes to sense orientations and use solar cells or a single transformer to power the platform some small missiles have powered the platform with light from a window or optic fibers to the motor a research topic is to suspend the platform with pressure from exhaust gases data is returned to the outside world via the transformers or sometimes leds communicating with external photodiodes lightweight digital computers permit the system to eliminate the gimbals creating strapdown systems so called because their sensors are simply strapped to the vehicle this reduces the cost eliminates gimbal lock removes the need for some calibrations and increases the reliability by eliminating some of the moving parts angular rate sensors called rate gyros measure the angular velocity of the vehicle a strapdown system needs a dynamic measurement range several hundred times that required by a gimballed system that is it must integrate the vehicles attitude changes in pitch roll and yaw as well as gross movements gimballed systems could usually do well with update rates of 5060 hz however strapdown systems normally update about 2000 hz the higher rate is needed to let the navigation system integrate the angular rate into an attitude accurately the data updating algorithms direction cosines or quaternions involved are too complex to be accurately performed except by digital electronics however digital computers are now so inexpensive and fast that rate gyro systems can now be practically used and massproduced the apollo lunar module used a strapdown system in its backup abort guidance system ags strapdown systems are nowadays commonly used in commercial and military applications aircraft ships rovs missiles etc stateoftheart strapdown systems are based upon ring laser gyroscopes fibre optic gyrocopes or hemispherical resonator gyroscopes they are using digital electronics and advanced digital filtering techniques such as kalman filter the orientation of a gyroscope system can sometimes also be inferred simply from its position history eg gps this is in particular the case with planes and cars where the velocity vector usually implies the orientation of the vehicle body for example honeywells align in motion23 is an initialization process where the initialization occurs while the aircraft is moving in the air or on the ground this is accomplished using gps and an inertial reasonableness test thereby allowing commercial data integrity requirements to be met this process has been faa certified to recover pure ins performance equivalent to stationary alignment procedures for civilian flight times up to 18 hours it avoids the need for gyroscope batteries on aircraft lessexpensive navigation systems intended for use in automobiles may use a vibrating structure gyroscope to detect changes in heading and the odometer pickup to measure distance covered along the vehicles track this type of system is much less accurate than a higherend ins but it is adequate for the typical automobile application where gps is the primary navigation system and dead reckoning is only needed to fill gaps in gps coverage when buildings or terrain block the satellite signals if a standing wave is induced in a hemispheric resonant structure and then the resonant structure is rotated the spherical harmonic standing wave rotates through an angle different from the quartz resonator structure due to the coriolis force the movement of the outer case with respect to the standing wave pattern is proportional to the total rotation angle and can be sensed by appropriate electronics the system resonators are machined from fused quartz due to its excellent mechanical properties the electrodes that drive and sense the standing waves are deposited directly onto separate quartz structures that surround the resonator these gyros can operate in either a whole angle mode which gives them nearly unlimited rate capability or a force rebalance mode that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro housing which gives them much better accuracy this system has almost no moving parts and is very accurate however it is still relatively expensive due to the cost of the precision ground and polished hollow quartz hemispheres northrop grumman currently manufactures imus inertial measurement units for spacecraft that use hrgs these imus have demonstrated extremely high reliability since their initial use in 199624 safran manufactures large numbers of hrg based inertial navigation systems dedicated to a wide range of applications25 these products include tuning fork gyros here the gyro is designed as an electronically driven tuning fork often fabricated out of a single piece of quartz or silicon such gyros operate in accordance with the dynamic theory that when an angle rate is applied to a translating body a coriolis force is generated this system is usually integrated on a silicon chip it has two massbalanced quartz tuning forks arranged handletohandle so forces cancel aluminum electrodes evaporated onto the forks and the underlying chip both drive and sense the motion the system is both manufacturable and inexpensive since quartz is dimensionally stable the system can be accurate as the forks are twisted about the axis of the handle the vibration of the tines tends to continue in the same plane of motion this motion has to be resisted by electrostatic forces from the electrodes under the tines by measuring the difference in capacitance between the two tines of a fork the system can determine the rate of angular motion current stateoftheart nonmilitary technology as of 2005update can build small solidstate sensors that can measure human body movements these devices have no moving parts and weigh about 50 grams 2 ounces solidstate devices using the same physical principles are used for image stabilization in small cameras or camcorders these can be extremely small around 5 millimetres 020 inches and are built with microelectromechanical systems mems technologies26 sensors based on magnetohydrodynamic principles can be used to measure angular velocities mems gyroscopes typically rely on the coriolis effect to measure angular velocity it consists of a resonating proof mass mounted in silicon the gyroscope is unlike an accelerometer an active sensor the proof mass is pushed back and forth by driving combs a rotation of the gyroscope generates a coriolis force that is acting on the mass which results in a motion in a different direction the motion in this direction is measured by electrodes and represents the rate of turn27 a ring laser gyro rlg splits a beam of laser light into two beams in opposite directions through narrow tunnels in a closed circular optical path around the perimeter of a triangular block of temperaturestable cervit glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner when the gyro is rotating at some angular rate the distance traveled by each beam will differthe shorter path being opposite to the rotation the phase shift between the two beams can be measured by an interferometer and is proportional to the rate of rotation sagnac effect in practice at low rotation rates the output frequency can drop to zero as the result of backscattering causing the beams to synchronise and lock together this is known as a lockin or laserlock the result is that there is no change in the interference pattern and therefore no measurement change to unlock the counterrotating light beams laser gyros either have independent light paths for the two directions usually in fiber optic gyros or the laser gyro is mounted on a piezoelectric dither motor that rapidly vibrates the laser ring back and forth about its input axis through the lockin region to decouple the light waves the shaker is the most accurate because both light beams use exactly the same path thus laser gyros retain moving parts but they do not move as far a more recent variation on the optical gyroscope the fiber optic gyroscope fog uses an external laser and two beams going opposite directions counterpropagating in long spools several kilometers of fiber optic filament with the phase difference of the two beams compared after their travel through the spools of fiber the basic mechanism monochromatic laser light travelling in opposite paths and the sagnac effect is the same in a fog and a rlg but the engineering details are substantially different in the fog compared to earlier laser gyros precise winding of the fiberoptic coil is required to ensure the paths taken by the light in opposite directions are as similar as possible the fog requires more complex calibrations than a laser ring gyro making the development and manufacture of fogs more technically challenging that for a rlg however fogs do not suffer from laser lock at low speeds and do not need to contain any moving parts increasing the maximum potential accuracy and lifespan of a fog over an equivalent rlg the basic openloop accelerometer consists of a mass attached to a spring the mass is constrained to move only in line with the spring acceleration causes deflection of the mass and the offset distance is measured the acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance mass and the spring constant the system must also be damped to avoid oscillation a closedloop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection thus keeping the mass nearly stationary whenever the mass deflects the feedback loop causes an electric coil to apply an equally negative force on the mass canceling the motion acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied because the mass barely moves the effects of nonlinearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced in addition this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth beyond the natural frequency of the sensing element both types of accelerometers have been manufactured as integrated micromachinery on silicon chips darpas microsystems technology office mto department is working on a micropnt microtechnology for positioning navigation and timing program
