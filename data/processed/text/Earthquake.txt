an earthquake also called a quake tremor or temblor is the shaking of the earths surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves earthquakes can range in intensity from those so weak they cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air damage critical infrastructure and wreak destruction across entire cities the seismic activity of an area is the frequency type and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time the seismicity at a particular location in the earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume in its most general sense the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities such as mining fracking and nuclear weapons testing the initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults but also by volcanism landslides and other seismic events significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 shaanxi earthquake in china with over 830000 fatalities and the 1960 valdivia earthquake in chile the largest ever recorded at 95 magnitude earthquakes result in various effects such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction leading to significant damage and loss of life when the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami earthquakes can trigger landslides earthquakes occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults including normal reverse thrust and strikeslip faults with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elasticrebound theory efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction forecasting and preparedness including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking the cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths religious beliefs and modern media reflecting their profound influence on human societies similar seismic phenomena known as marsquakes and moonquakes have been observed on other celestial bodies indicating the universality of such events beyond earth an earthquake is the shaking of the surface of earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes tremors or temblors the word tremor is also used for nonearthquake seismic rumbling in its most general sense an earthquake is any seismic eventwhether natural or caused by humansthat generates seismic waves earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity landslides mine blasts fracking and nuclear tests an earthquakes point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus the epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter the seismic activity of an area is the frequency type and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time the seismicity at a particular location in the earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume one of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 shaanxi earthquake which occurred on 23 january 1556 in shaanxi china more than 100000 people died with the region losing up to 830000 people afterwards due to emmigration plague and famine2 most houses in the area were yaodongsdwellings carved out of loess hillsidesand many victims were killed when these structures collapsed the 1976 tangshan earthquake which killed between 240000 and 655000 people was the deadliest of the 20th century3 the 1960 chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph reaching 95 magnitude on 22 may 196045 its epicenter was near caete chile the energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake the good friday earthquake 27 march 1964 which was centered in prince william sound alaska67 the ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes however of these ten only the 2004 indian ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life while powerful were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful and poor regions with lax unenforced or nonexistent seismic building codes tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane the sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance most fault surfaces do have such asperities which leads to a form of stickslip behavior once the fault has locked continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface this continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault releasing the stored energy8 this energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves9 frictional heating of the fault surface and cracking of the rock thus causing an earthquake this process of gradual buildup of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elasticrebound theory it is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquakes total energy is radiated as seismic energy most of the earthquakes energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction therefore earthquakes lower the earths available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the earths deep interior10 there are three main types of fault all of which may cause an interplate earthquake normal reverse thrust and strikeslip normal and reverse faulting are examples of dipslip where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dipslip and strikeslip this is known as oblique slip the topmost brittle part of the earths crust and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures rocks hotter than about 300 c 572 f flow in response to stress they do not rupture in earthquakes1112 the maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults which may break in a single rupture are approximately 1000 km 620 mi examples are the earthquakes in alaska 1957 chile 1960 and sumatra 2004 all in subduction zones the longest earthquake ruptures on strikeslip faults like the san andreas fault 1857 1906 the north anatolian fault in turkey 1939 and the denali fault in alaska 2002 are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins and those along normal faults are even shorter normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7 maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers as in iceland where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres 37 mi1314 reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary reverse faults particularly those along convergent boundaries are associated with the most powerful earthquakes called megathrust earthquakes including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90 of the total seismic moment released worldwide15 strikeslip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other transform boundaries are a particular type of strikeslip fault strikeslip faults particularly continental transforms can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8 strikeslip faults tend to be oriented near vertically resulting in an approximate width of 10 km 62 mi within the brittle crust16 thus earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible in addition there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types thrust faults are generated by the highest strikeslip by intermediate and normal faults by the lowest stress levels17 this can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress the direction of the force that pushes the rock mass during the faulting in the case of normal faults the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction thus the pushing force greatest principal stress equals the weight of the rock mass itself in the case of thrusting the rock mass escapes in the direction of the least principal stress namely upward lifting the rock mass and thus the overburden equals the least principal stress strikeslip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above this difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting which contributes to differences in the radiated energy regardless of fault dimensions for every unit increase in seismic magnitude there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released for instance an earthquake of magnitude 60 releases approximately 32 times as much energy as an earthquake of magnitude 50 and a 70 magnitude earthquake releases about 1000 times as much energy as a 50 magnitude earthquake an 86magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10000 atomic bombs of the size used in world war ii18 this is so because the energy released in an earthquake and thus its magnitude is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures19 and the stress drop therefore the greater the length and width of the faulted area the greater the resulting magnitude the most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault however is not the maximum available length but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20 along converging plate margins the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow typically about 10 degrees20 thus the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the earth can reach 50100 km 3162 mi such as in japan 2011 or in alaska 1964 making the most powerful earthquakes possible the majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the ring of fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers earthquakes occurring at depths less than 70 km 43 mi are classified as shallowfocus earthquakes while those with focal depths between 70 and 300 km 43 and 186 mi are commonly termed midfocus or intermediatedepth earthquakes in subduction zones where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate deepfocus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths ranging from 300 to 700 km 190 to 430 mi21 these seismically active areas of subduction are known as wadatibenioff zones deepfocus earthquakes occur at depths where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle due to the high temperature and pressure a possible mechanism for the generation of deepfocus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure22 earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions as during the 1980 eruption of mount st helens23 earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes these swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters a device that measures ground slope and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions24 a tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus once the rupture has been initiated it begins to propagate away from the focus spreading out along the fault surface lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier such as the end of a fault segment or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture for larger earthquakes the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittleductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface the mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion25 in most cases the rupture speed approaches but does not exceed the shear wave s wave velocity of the surrounding rock there are a few exceptions to this supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the s wave velocity these have so far all been observed during large strikeslip events the unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities a particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake observed where the relatively low felt intensities caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast as in the 1896 sanriku earthquake25 during an earthquake high temperatures can develop at the fault plane increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock272829 in the coseismic phase such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed in the postseismic phase it can control the aftershock sequence because after the main event pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network3029 from the point of view of the mohrcoulomb strength theory an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place and fluids can exert a lubricating effect as thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability after the mainshock the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults giving rise to aftershocks3029 analogously artificial pore pressure increase by fluid injection in earths crust may induce seismicity tides may trigger some seismicity31 most earthquakes form part of a sequence related to each other in terms of location and time32 most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern33 earthquake clustering has been observed for example in parkfield california where a longterm research study is being conducted around the parkfield earthquake cluster34 an aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake the mainshock rapid changes of stress between rocks and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks35 along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock32 an aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude however they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock35 if an aftershock is larger than the mainshock the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock32 earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period they are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock so none has a notably higher magnitude than another an example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at yellowstone national park36 in august 2012 a swarm of earthquakes shook southern californias imperial valley showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s37 sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault these storms occur over the course of years with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the north anatolian fault in turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the middle east3839 it is estimated that around 500000 earthquakes occur each year detectable with current instrumentation about 100000 of these can be felt45 minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like california and alaska in the us as well as in el salvador mexico guatemala chile peru indonesia the philippines iran pakistan the azores in portugal turkey new zealand greece italy india nepal and japan41 larger earthquakes occur less frequently the relationship being exponential for example roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 542 in the low seismicity united kingdom for example it has been calculated that the average recurrences are an earthquake of 3746 every year an earthquake of 4755 every 10 years and an earthquake of 56 or larger every 100 years43 this is an example of the gutenbergrichter law the number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today as a result many more earthquakes are reported than in the past but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes the united states geological survey usgs estimates that since 1900 there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes magnitude 7079 and one great earthquake magnitude 80 or greater per year and that this average has been relatively stable44 in recent years the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend45 more detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the united states geological survey46 a recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity interspersed with longer periods of low intensity however accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case47 most of the worlds earthquakes 90 and 81 of the largest take place in the 40000kilometrelong 25000 mi horseshoeshaped zone called the circumpacific seismic belt known as the pacific ring of fire which for the most part bounds the pacific plate4849 massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too such as along the himalayan mountains50 with the rapid growth of megacities such as mexico city tokyo and tehran in areas of high seismic risk some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people51 while most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the earths tectonic plates human activity can also produce earthquakes activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust including building reservoirs extracting resources such as coal or oil and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking52 most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes the 57 magnitude 2011 oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells53 and studies point to the states oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century54 a columbia university paper suggested that the 80 magnitude 2008 sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the zipingpu dam55 though the link has not been conclusively proved56 the instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the richter scale in the 1930s it is a relatively simple measurement of an events amplitude and its use has become minimal in the 21st century seismic waves travel through the earths interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances the surfacewave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events the moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment total rupture area average slip of the fault and rigidity of the rock the japan meteorological agency seismic intensity scale the medvedevsponheuerkarnik scale and the mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking the shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times before the development of strongmotion accelerometers the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods the magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake intensity values vary from place to place depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup57 the first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by charles francis richter in 1935 subsequent scales seismic magnitude scales have retained a key feature where each unit represents a tenfold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32fold difference in energy subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale58 although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as richter magnitude or richter scale standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquakes strength on the moment magnitude scale which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake the static seismic moment5960 every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves which travel through rock with different velocities propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx 3 kms 19 mis up to 13 kms 81 mis depending on the density and elasticity of the medium in the earths interior the shock or p waves travel much faster than the s waves approx relation 171 the differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the earth also the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly p wave speed s waves speed as a consequence the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the earths mantle on average the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the p and s wave arrival times multiplied by 861 slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure by such analysis of seismograms the earths core was located in 1913 by beno gutenberg s waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to p waves p waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling whereas s waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth62 earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur the world is divided into 754 flinnengdahl regions fe regions which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity more active zones are divided into smaller fe regions whereas less active zones belong to larger fe regions standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude date and time of occurrence geographic coordinates of its epicenter depth of the epicenter geographical region distances to population centers location uncertainty several parameters that are included in usgs earthquake reports number of stations reporting number of observations etc and a unique event id63 although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 tohokuoki fukushima earthquake6465 the effects of earthquakes include but are not limited to the following shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures the severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude the distance from the epicenter and the local geological and geomorphological conditions which may amplify or reduce wave propagation66 the groundshaking is measured by ground acceleration specific local geological geomorphological and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from lowintensity earthquakes this effect is called site or local amplification it is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the earths surface along the trace of the fault which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams bridges and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure67 soil liquefaction occurs when because of the shaking watersaturated granular material such as sand temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures like buildings and bridges to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits for example in the 1964 alaska earthquake soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground eventually collapsing upon themselves68 physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts and longer lasting from a seismic event compared to welldeveloped communities69 impacts may include with these impacts and others the aftermath may bring disease a lack of basic necessities mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors70 and higher insurance premiums recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community china stood out in several categories in a study group of 162 earthquakes from 1772 to 2021 that included landslide fatalities due to the 2008 sichuan earthquake it had 42 of all landslide fatalities within the study total event deaths were higher they were followed by peru 22 from the 1970 ancash earthquake and pakistan 21 from the 2005 kashmir earthquake china was also on top with the highest area affected by landslides with more than 80000 km2 followed by canada with 66000 km2 1988 saguenay and 1946 vancouver island strikeslip 61 events was the dominant fault type listed followed closely by thrustreverse 57 and normal 3371 earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines in the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started for example more deaths in the 1906 san francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself72 tsunamis are longwavelength longperiod sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of waterincluding when an earthquake occurs at sea in the open ocean the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres 62 mi and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour such tsunamis travel 600800 kilometers per hour 373497 miles per hour depending on water depth large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them73 ordinarily subduction earthquakes under magnitude 75 do not cause tsunamis although some instances of this have been recorded most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 75 or more73 floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers which collapse and cause floods74 the terrain below the sarez lake in tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake known as the usoi dam were to fail during a future earthquake impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people75 earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time location and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits76 many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur despite considerable research efforts by seismologists scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month77 popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather in the early morning7879 while forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades80 for wellunderstood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated8182 earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress but before the ground surface has begun to move potentially allowing people within the systems range to seek shelter before the earthquakes impact is felt the objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings bridges tunnels roadways and other structures and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations the igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them it has been applied to assess buildings in lisbon rhodes and naples83 individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone locating shutoffs for utilities and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts for areas near large bodies of water earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake from the lifetime of the greek philosopher anaxagoras in the 5th century bce to the 14th century ce earthquakes were usually attributed to air vapors in the cavities of the earth84 pliny the elder called earthquakes underground thunderstorms84 thales of miletus 625547 bce was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water84 in norse mythology earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god loki being punished for the murder of baldr god of beauty and light85 in greek mythology poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes86 in japanese mythology namazu is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes87 in taiwanese folklore the tg is a giant earth buffalo who causes earthquakes88 in the new testament matthews gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of jesus matthew 2751 54 and at his resurrection matthew 28289 in modern popular culture the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste such as kobe in 1995 or san francisco in 190690 fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning90 for this reason stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath as in short walk to daylight 1972 the ragged edge 1968 or aftershock earthquake in new york 199990 a notable example is heinrich von kleists classic novella the earthquake in chile which describes the destruction of santiago in 1647 haruki murakamis short fiction collection after the quake depicts the consequences of the kobe earthquake of 1995 the most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical big one expected of californias san andreas fault someday as depicted in the novels richter 10 1996 goodbye california 1977 2012 2009 and san andreas 2015 among other works90 phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets eg marsquakes on mars and on the moon eg moonquakes
