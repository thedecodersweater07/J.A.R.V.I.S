john milton cage jr september 5 1912 august 12 1992 was an american composer and music theorist a pioneer of indeterminacy in music electroacoustic music and nonstandard use of musical instruments cage was one of the leading figures of the postwar avantgarde critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century1234 he was also instrumental in the development of modern dance mostly through his association with choreographer merce cunningham who was also cages romantic partner for most of their lives56 cages teachers included henry cowell 1933 and arnold schoenberg 193335 both known for their radical innovations in music but cages major influences lay in various east and south asian cultures through his studies of indian philosophy and zen buddhism in the late 1940s cage came to the idea of aleatoric or chancecontrolled music which he started composing in 19517 the i ching an ancient chinese classic text and decisionmaking tool became cages standard composition tool for the rest of his life8 in a 1957 lecture experimental music he described music as a purposeless play which is an affirmation of life not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation but simply a way of waking up to the very life were living9 cages best known work is the 1952 composition 433 a piece performed in the absence of deliberate sound musicians who perform the work do nothing but be present for the duration specified by the title the content of the composition is intended to be the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance1011 the works challenge to assumed definitions about musicianship and musical experience made it a popular and controversial topic both in musicology and the broader aesthetics of art and performance cage was also a pioneer of the prepared piano a piano with its sound altered by objects placed between or on its strings or hammers for which he wrote numerous dancerelated works and a few concert pieces these include sonatas and interludes 19464812 cage was born september 5 1912 at good samaritan hospital in downtown los angeles13 his father john milton cage sr 18861964 was an inventor and his mother lucretia crete harvey 18811968 worked intermittently as a journalist for the los angeles times14 the familys roots were deeply american in a 1976 interview cage mentioned that george washington was assisted by an ancestor named john cage in the task of surveying the colony of virginia15 cage described his mother as a woman with a sense of society who was never happy16 while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions sometimes idealistic such as a dieselfueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles the senior cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine14 others revolutionary and against the scientific norms such as the electrostatic field theory of the universea john cage sr taught his son that if someone says cant that shows you what to do in 194445 cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents crete and dad the latter is a short lively piece that ends abruptly while crete is a slightly longer mostly melodic contrapuntal work17 when cage was 18 months old he ate two or three strychinine tablets at first the babys life was despaired of but a stomach pump was administered with success18 cages first experiences with music were from private piano teachers in the greater los angeles area and several relatives particularly his aunt phoebe harvey james who introduced him to the piano music of the 19th century he received first piano lessons when he was in the fourth grade at school but although he liked music he expressed more interest in sight reading than in developing virtuoso piano technique and apparently was not thinking of composition19 during high school one of his music teachers was fannie charles dillon20 by 1928 though cage was convinced that he wanted to be a writer he graduated that year from los angeles high school as a valedictorian21 having also in the spring given a prizewinning speech at the hollywood bowl proposing a day of quiet for all americans by being hushed and silent he said we should have the opportunity to hear what other people think anticipating 433 by more than thirty years22 cage enrolled at pomona college in claremont as a theology major in 1928 at pomona he encountered the work of the artist marcel duchamp via professor jos pijoan of the writer james joyce via don sample of the philosopher ananda coomaraswamy and of the composer henry cowell20 in 1930 he dropped out of pomona having come to believe that college was of no use to a writer23 after an incident described in his 1991 autobiographical statement i was shocked at college to see one hundred of my classmates in the library all reading copies of the same book instead of doing as they did i went into the stacks and read the first book written by an author whose name began with z i received the highest grade in the class that convinced me that the institution was not being run correctly i left16 cage persuaded his parents that a trip to europe would be more beneficial to a future writer than college studies24 he subsequently hitchhiked to galveston and sailed to le havre where he took a train to paris25 cage stayed in europe for some 18 months trying his hand at various forms of art first he studied gothic and greek architecture but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it23 he then took up painting poetry and music it was in europe that encouraged by his teacher lazare lvy26 he first heard the music of contemporary composers such as igor stravinsky and paul hindemith and finally got to know the music of johann sebastian bach which he had not experienced before after several months in paris cages enthusiasm for america was revived after he read walt whitmans leaves of grasshe wanted to return immediately but his parents with whom he regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip persuaded him to stay in europe for a little longer and explore the continent27 cage started traveling visiting various places in france germany and spain as well as capri and most importantly majorca where he started composing28 his first compositions were created using dense mathematical formulas but cage was displeased with the results and left the finished pieces behind when he left29 cages association with theater also started in europe during a walk in seville he witnessed in his own words the multiplicity of simultaneous visual and audible events all going together in ones experience and producing enjoyment30 cage returned to the united states in 193129 he went to santa monica california where he made a living partly by giving small private lectures on contemporary art he got to know various important figures of the southern california art world including arts patron galka scheyer23 and his later composition teacher richard buhlig31 by 1933 cage had decided to concentrate on music rather than painting the people who heard my music had better things to say about it than the people who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings cage later explained23 in 1933 he sent some of his compositions to henry cowell the reply was a rather vague letter32 in which cowell suggested that cage study with arnold schoenbergcages musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25tone row somewhat similar to schoenbergs twelvetone technique33 cowell also advised that before approaching schoenberg cage should take some preliminary lessons and recommended adolph weiss a former schoenberg pupil34 weiss had been asked by schoenberg to be his assistant and to train students who might not be ready for schoenbergs teaching35 following cowells advice cage travelled to new york city in 1933 and started studying with weiss as well as taking lessons from cowell himself at the new school31 he supported himself financially by taking up a job washing walls at a ywca young womens christian association in brooklyn36 cages routine during that period was apparently very tiring with just four hours of sleep on most nights and four hours of composition every day starting at 4 am3637 several months later still in 1933 cage became sufficiently good at composition to approach schoenbergb he could not afford schoenbergs price and when he mentioned it the older composer asked whether cage would devote his life to music after cage replied that he would schoenberg offered to tutor him free of charge38 cage studied with schoenberg in california first at university of southern california and then at university of california los angeles as well as privately31 the older composer became one of the biggest influences on cage who literally worshipped him39 particularly as an example of how to live ones life being a composer37 the vow cage gave to dedicate his life to music was apparently still important some 40 years later when cage had no need for it ie writing music he continued composing partly because of the promise he gave40 schoenbergs methods and their influence on cage are well documented by cage himself in various lectures and writings particularly wellknown is the conversation mentioned in the 1958 lecture indeterminacy after i had been studying with him for two years schoenberg said in order to write music you must have a feeling for harmony i explained to him that i had no feeling for harmony he then said that i would always encounter an obstacle that it would be as though i came to a wall through which i could not pass i said in that case i will devote my life to beating my head against that wall41 cage studied with schoenberg for two years but although he admired his teacher he decided to leave after schoenberg told the assembled students that he was trying to make it impossible for them to write music much later cage recounted the incident when he said that i revolted not against him but against what he had said i determined then and there more than ever before to write music39 although schoenberg was not impressed with cages compositional abilities during these two years in a later interview where he initially said that none of his american pupils were interesting he further stated in reference to cage there was one of course hes not a composer but hes an inventorof genius39 cage would later adopt the inventor moniker and deny that he was in fact a composer42 at some point in 193435 during his studies with schoenberg cage was working at his mothers arts and crafts shop where he met artist xenia andreyevna kashevaroff she was an alaskanborn daughter of a russian priest her work encompassed fine bookbinding sculpture and collage although cage was involved in relationships with don sample and with architect rudolph schindlers wife pauline20 when he met xenia he fell in love immediately cage and kashevaroff were married in the desert at yuma arizona on june 7 193543 the newly married couple first lived with cages parents in pacific palisades then moved to hollywood44 during 193638 cage changed jobs multiple times including to one that started his lifelong association with modern dance dance accompanist at the university of california los angeles he produced music for choreographies and at one point taught a course on musical accompaniments for rhythmic expression at ucla with his aunt phoebe45 it was during that time that cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments such as household items metal sheets and so on this was inspired by oskar fischinger who told cage that everything in the world has a spirit that can be released through its sound although cage did not share the idea of spirits these words inspired him to begin exploring the sounds produced by hitting various nonmusical objects4546 in 1938 on cowells recommendation cage drove to san francisco to find employment and to seek out fellow cowell student and composer lou harrison according to cowell the two composers had a shared interest in percussion and dance and would likely hit it off indeed upon meeting the two immediately established a strong bond and began a working relationship that continued for several years harrison soon helped cage to secure a faculty position at mills college teaching the same program as at ucla and collaborating with choreographer marian van tuyl several famous dance groups were present and cages interest in modern dance grew further45 after several months he left and moved to seattle washington where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer bonnie bird at the cornish college of the arts the cornish school years proved to be a particularly important period in cages life aside from teaching and working as accompanist cage organized a percussion ensemble that toured the west coast and brought the composer his first fame his reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the prepared pianoa piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on beneath or between the stringsin 1940 this concept was originally intended for a performance staged in a room too small to include a full percussion ensemble it was also at the cornish school that cage met several people who became lifelong friends such as painter mark tobey and dancer merce cunningham the latter was to become cages lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator cage left seattle in the summer of 1941 after the painter lszl moholynagy invited him to teach at the chicago school of design what later became the iit institute of design the composer accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities to organize a center for experimental music that were not available in seattle these opportunities did not materialize cage taught at the chicago school of design and worked as accompanist and composer at the university of chicago at one point his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the columbia broadcasting system to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by kenneth patchen the result the city wears a slouch hat was received well and cage deduced that more important commissions would follow hoping to find these he left chicago for new york city in the spring of 1942 in new york the cages first stayed with painter max ernst and peggy guggenheim through them cage met important artists such as piet mondrian andr breton jackson pollock marcel duchamp and many others guggenheim was very supportive the cages could stay with her and ernst for any length of time and she offered to organize a concert of cages music at the opening of her gallery which included paying for transportation of cages percussion instruments from chicago after she learned that cage had secured a concert at the museum of modern art moma guggenheim withdrew all support and even after the ultimately successful moma concert cage was left homeless unemployed and penniless the commissions he hoped for did not happen he and xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer jean erdman and her husband joseph campbell without the percussion instruments cage again turned to prepared piano producing a substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers including merce cunningham who had moved to new york city several years earlier cage and cunningham eventually became romantically involved and cages marriage already breaking up during the early 1940s ended in divorce in 1945 cunningham remained cages partner for the rest of his life cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing on one occasion for voice and closed piano the resulting piece the wonderful widow of eighteen springs 1942 quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of cathy berberian and luciano berio47 in 1944 he appeared in maya derens at land a 15minute silent experimental film like his personal life cages artistic life went through a crisis in the mid1940s the composer was experiencing a growing disillusionment with the idea of music as means of communication the public rarely accepted his work and cage himself too had trouble understanding the music of his colleagues in early 1946 cage agreed to tutor gita sarabhai an indian musician who came to the us to study western music in return he asked her to teach him about indian music and philosophy48 cage also attended in the late 1940s and early 1950s d t suzukis lectures on zen buddhism49 and read further the works of coomaraswamy31 the first fruits of these studies were works inspired by indian concepts sonatas and interludes for prepared piano string quartet in four parts and others cage accepted the goal of music as explained to him by sarabhai to sober and quiet the mind thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences50 early in 1946 his former teacher richard buhlig arranged for cage to meet berlinborn pianist grete sultan who had escaped from nazi persecution to new york in 194151 they became close lifelong friends and cage later dedicated part of his music for piano and his monumental piano cycle etudes australes to her in 1949 he received a guggenheim fellowship52 after a 1949 performance at carnegie hall new york cage received a grant from the guggenheim foundation which enabled him to make a trip to europe where he met composers such as olivier messiaen and pierre boulez more important was cages chance encounter with morton feldman in new york city in early 1950 both composers attended a new york philharmonic concert where the orchestra performed anton weberns symphony followed by a piece by sergei rachmaninoff cage felt so overwhelmed by weberns piece that he left before the rachmaninoff and in the lobby he met feldman who was leaving for the same reason53 the two composers quickly became friends some time later cage feldman earle brown david tudor and cages pupil christian wolff came to be referred to as the new york school5455 in early 1951 wolff presented cage with a copy of the i ching56a chinese classic text which describes a symbol system used to identify order in chance events this version of the i ching was the first complete english translation and had been published by wolffs father kurt wolff of pantheon books in 1950 the i ching is commonly used for divination but for cage it became a tool to compose using chance57 to compose a piece of music cage would come up with questions to ask the i ching the book would then be used in much the same way as it is used for divination for cage this meant imitating nature in its manner of operation5859 his lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composers will when i hear what we call music it seems to me that someone is talking and talking about his feelings or about his ideas of relationships but when i hear traffic the sound of traffichere on sixth avenue for instancei dont have the feeling that anyone is talking i have the feeling that sound is acting and i love the activity of sound i dont need sound to talk to me60 although cage had used chance on a few earlier occasions most notably in the third movement of concerto for prepared piano and chamber orchestra 19505161 the i ching opened new possibilities in this field for him the first results of the new approach were imaginary landscape no 4 for 12 radio receivers and music of changes for piano the latter work was written for david tudor62 whom cage met through feldmananother friendship that lasted until cages deathc tudor premiered most of cages works until the early 1960s when he stopped performing on the piano and concentrated on composing music the i ching became cages standard tool for composition he used it in practically every work composed after 1951 and eventually settled on a computer algorithm that calculated numbers in a manner similar to throwing coins for the i ching despite the fame sonatas and interludes earned him and the connections he cultivated with american and european composers and musicians cage was quite poor although he still had an apartment at 326 monroe street which he had occupied since around 1946 his financial situation in 1951 worsened so much that while working on music of changes he prepared a set of instructions for tudor as to how to complete the piece in the event of his death63 nevertheless cage managed to survive and maintained an active artistic life with lectures and performances in 19521953 he completed another mammoth projectthe williams mix a piece of tape music which earle brown and morton feldman helped to put together64 also in 1952 cage composed the piece that became his bestknown and most controversial creation 433 the score instructs the performer not to play the instrument during the entire duration of the piecefour minutes thirtythree secondsand is meant to be perceived as consisting of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed cage had conceived of a silent piece years earlier but was reluctant to write it down indeed the premiere given by tudor on august 29 1952 at woodstock new york caused an uproar in the audience65 the reaction to 433 was just a part of the larger picture on the whole it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for cages reputation the press which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music ignored his new works and many valuable friendships and connections were lost pierre boulez who used to promote cages work in europe was opposed to cages particular approach to the use of chance and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s such as karlheinz stockhausen66 during this time cage was also teaching at the avantgarde black mountain college just outside asheville north carolina cage taught at the college in the summers of 1948 and 1952 and was in residence the summer of 1953 while at black mountain college in 1952 he organized what has been called the first happening see discussion below in the united states later titled theatre piece no 1 a multilayered multimedia performance event staged the same day as cage conceived it that that would greatly influence 1950s and 60s artistic practices in addition to cage the participants included cunningham and tudor67 from 1953 onward cage was busy composing music for modern dance particularly cunninghams dances cages partner adopted chance too out of fascination for the movement of the human body as well as developing new methods of using chance in a series of works he referred to as the ten thousand things in the summer of 1954 he moved out of new york and settled in gate hill cooperative a community in stony point new york where his neighbors included david tudor m c richards karen karnes stan vanderbeek and sari dienes the composers financial situation gradually improved in late 1954 he and tudor were able to embark on a european tour from 1956 to 1961 cage taught classes in experimental composition at the new school and from 1956 to 1958 he also worked as an art director and designer of typography68 among the works completed during the last years of the decade were concert for piano and orchestra 195758 a seminal work in the history of graphic notation69 and variations i 1958 cage was affiliated with wesleyan university and collaborated with members of its music department from the 1950s until his death in 1992 at the university the philosopher poet and professor of classics norman o brown befriended cage an association that proved fruitful to both7071 in 1960 the composer was appointed a fellow on the faculty of the center for advanced studies now the center for humanities in the liberal arts and sciences at wesleyan72 where he started teaching classes in experimental music in october 1961 wesleyan university press published silence a collection of cages lectures and writings on a wide variety of subjects including the famous lecture on nothing that was composed using a complex time length scheme much like some of cages music silence was cages first book of six but it remains his most widely read and influentiald31 in the early 1960s cage began his lifelong association with cf peters corporation walter hinrichsen the president of the corporation offered cage an exclusive contract and instigated the publication of a catalog of cages works which appeared in 196268 edition peters soon published a large number of scores by cage and this together with the publication of silence led to much greater prominence for the composer than ever beforeone of the positive consequences of this was that in 1965 betty freeman set up an annual grant for living expenses for cage which continued until his death73 by the mid1960s cage was receiving so many commissions and requests for appearances that he was unable to fulfill them this was accompanied by a busy touring schedule consequently cages compositional output from that decade was scant31 after the orchestral atlas eclipticalis 196162 a fully notated work based on star charts cage gradually shifted to in his own words music not composition the score of 000 completed in 1962 originally comprised a single sentence in a situation provided with maximum amplification perform a disciplined action and in the first performance the disciplined action was cage writing that sentence the score of variations iii 1962 abounds in instructions to the performers but makes no references to music musical instruments or sounds many of the variations and other 1960s pieces were in fact happenings an art form established by cage and his students in late 1950s cages experimental composition classes at the new school have become legendary as an american source of fluxus an international network of artists composers and designers the majority of his students had little or no background in music most were artists they included jackson mac low allan kaprow al hansen george brecht ben patterson and dick higgins as well as many others cage invited unofficially famous pieces that resulted from the classes include george brechts time table music and al hansens alice denham in 48 seconds74 as set forth by cage happenings were theatrical events that abandon the traditional concept of stageaudience and occur without a sense of definite duration instead they are left to chance they have a minimal script with no plot in fact a happening is sonamed because it occurs in the present attempting to arrest the concept of passing time cage believed that theater was the closest route to integrating art and real life the term happenings was coined by allan kaprow one of his students who defined it as a genre in the late fifties cage met kaprow while on a mushroom hunt with george segal and invited him to join his class in following these developments cage was strongly influenced by antonin artauds seminal treatise the theatre and its double and the happenings of this period can be viewed as a forerunner to the ensuing fluxus movement in october 1960 mary bauermeisters cologne studio hosted a joint concert by cage and the video artist nam june paik cages friend and mentee who in the course of his performance of etude for piano cut off cages tie and then poured a bottle of shampoo over the heads of cage and tudor75 in 1967 cages book a year from monday was first published by wesleyan university press cages parents died during the decade his father in 196476 and his mother in 1969 cage had their ashes scattered in ramapo mountains near stony point and asked for the same to be done to him after his death77 cages work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious not to mention socially utopian pieces reflecting the mood of the era yet also his absorption of the writings of both marshall mcluhan on the effects of new media and r buckminster fuller on the power of technology to promote social change hpschd 1969 a gargantuan and longrunning multimedia work made in collaboration with lejaren hiller incorporated the mass superimposition of seven harpsichords playing chancedetermined excerpts from the works of cage hiller and a potted history of canonical classics with 52 tapes of computergenerated sounds 6400 slides of designs many supplied by nasa and shown from sixtyfour slide projectors with 40 motionpicture films the piece was initially rendered in a fivehour performance at the university of illinois in 1969 in which the audience arrived after the piece had begun and left before it ended wandering freely around the auditorium in the time for which they were there78 also in 1969 cage produced the first fully notated work in years cheap imitation for piano the piece is a chancecontrolled reworking of erik saties socrate and as both listeners and cage himself noted openly sympathetic to its source although cages affection for saties music was wellknown it was highly unusual for him to compose a personal work one in which the composer is present when asked about this apparent contradiction cage replied obviously cheap imitation lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general and thats disturbing im the first to be disturbed by it79 cages fondness for the piece resulted in a recordinga rare occurrence since cage disliked making recordings of his musicmade in 197680 overall cheap imitation marked a major change in cages music he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments and tried out several new approaches such as improvisation which he previously discouraged but was able to use in works from the 1970s such as child of tree 197581 cheap imitation became the last work cage performed in public himself arthritis had troubled cage since 1960 and by the early 1970s his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform82 nevertheless he still played cheap imitation during the 1970s83 before finally having to give up performing preparing manuscripts also became difficult before published versions of pieces were done in cages calligraphic script now manuscripts for publication had to be completed by assistants matters were complicated further by david tudors departure from performing in the early 1970s tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead and so cage for the first time in two decades had to rely on other performers and their respective abilities such performers included grete sultan paul zukofsky margaret leng tan and many others aside from music cage continued writing books of prose and poetry mesostics m was first published by wesleyan university press in 1973 in january 1978 cage was invited by kathan brown of crown point press to engage in printmaking and cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death these together with some late watercolors constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art in 1979 cages empty words was first published by wesleyan university press in 1987 cage completed a piece called two for flute and piano dedicated to performers roberto fabbriciani and carlo neri the title referred to the number of performers needed the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints cage went on to write some forty such number pieces as they came to be known usually employing a variant of the same technique one of the last was eighty 1992 premiered in munich on october 28 2011 the process of composition in many of the later number pieces was simple selection of pitch range and pitches from that range using chance procedures31 the music has been linked to cages anarchic leanings84 one11 ie the eleventh piece for a single performer completed in early 1992 was cages first and only foray into film cage conceived his last musical work with michael bach bachtischa one13 for violoncello with curved bow and three loudspeakers which was published years later another new direction also taken in 1987 was opera cage produced five operas all sharing the same title europera between 198791 europeras i and ii require greater resources than iii iv and v which are on a chamber scale they were commissioned by the frankfurt opera to celebrate his seventyfifth birthday and according to music critic mark swed they took an enormous effort on the composers partrequiring two fulltime assistants and two computers humming day and night85 these pieces caused quite a stir in the world of opera at the time with their unconventional methods for staging and sequencing many standard pieces of operatic repertoire were used but not in any preset order rather they were selected by chance meaning no two performances were exactly alike many of those who were to be a part of these performances refused to participate citing the impossibility of the requests cage was making days before europeras i and ii were to be premiered frankfurts opera house burned down setting into motion a series of setbacks leading to a theatrical run met with mixed reactions including a performance so bad that cage penned a letter to his musicians criticizing their interpretation of his composition85 in the course of the 1980s cages health worsened progressively he suffered not only from arthritis but also from sciatica and arteriosclerosis he had a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted and in 1985 broke an arm during this time cage pursued a macrobiotic diet86 nevertheless ever since arthritis started plaguing him the composer was aware of his age and as biographer david revill observed the fire which he began to incorporate in his visual work in 1985 is not only the fire he has set aside for so longthe fire of passionbut also fire as transitoriness and fragility on august 11 1992 while preparing evening tea for himself and cunningham cage had another stroke he was taken to st vincents hospital in manhattan where he died on the morning of august 1287 he was 792 according to his wishes cages body was cremated and his ashes scattered in the ramapo mountains near stony point new york at the same place where he had scattered the ashes of his parents77 the composers death occurred only weeks before a celebration of his 80th birthday organized in frankfurt by composer walter zimmermann and musicologist stefan schaedler2 the event went ahead as planned including a performance of the concert for piano and orchestra by david tudor and ensemble modern merce cunningham died of natural causes in july 200988 cages first completed pieces have been lost according to the composer the earliest works were very short pieces for piano composed using complex mathematical procedures and lacking in sensual appeal and expressive power89 cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results until richard buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure most works from the early 1930s such as sonata for clarinet 1933 and composition for 3 voices 1934 are highly chromatic and betray cages interest in counterpoint around the same time the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25note rows90 after studies with schoenberg who never taught dodecaphony to his students cage developed another tone row technique in which the row was split into short motives which would then be repeated and transposed according to a set of rules this approach was first used in two pieces for piano c 1935 and then with modifications in larger works such as metamorphosis and five songs both 1938 soon after cage started writing percussion music and music for modern dance he started using a technique that placed the rhythmic structure of the piece into the foreground in imaginary landscape no 1 1939 there are four large sections of 16 17 18 and 19 bars and each section is divided into four subsections the first three of which were all 5 bars long first construction in metal 1939 expands on the concept there are five sections of 4 3 2 3 and 4 units respectively each unit contains 16 bars and is divided the same way 4 bars 3 bars 2 bars etc finally the musical content of the piece is based on sixteen motives91 such nested proportions as cage called them became a regular feature of his music throughout the 1940s the technique was elevated to great complexity in later pieces such as sonatas and interludes for prepared piano 194648 in which many proportions used noninteger numbers 1 1 1 and 1 for sonata i for example92 or a flower a song for voice and closed piano in which two sets of proportions are used simultaneously93 in late 1940s cage started developing further methods of breaking away with traditional harmony for instance in string quartet in four parts 1950 cage first composed a number of gamuts chords with fixed instrumentation the piece progresses from one gamut to another in each instance the gamut was selected only based on whether it contains the note necessary for the melody and so the rest of the notes do not form any directional harmony31 concerto for prepared piano 195051 used a system of charts of durations dynamics melodies etc from which cage would choose using simple geometric patterns31 the last movement of the concerto was a step towards using chance procedures which cage adopted soon afterwards94 a chart system was also used along with nested proportions for the large piano work music of changes 1951 only here material would be selected from the charts by using the i ching all of cages music since 1951 was composed using chance procedures most commonly using the i ching for example works from music for piano were based on paper imperfections the imperfections themselves provided pitches coin tosses and i ching hexagram numbers were used to determine the accidentals clefs and playing techniques95 a whole series of works was created by applying chance operations ie the i ching to star charts atlas eclipticalis 196162 and a series of etudes etudes australes 197475 freeman etudes 197790 and etudes boreales 197896 cages etudes are all extremely difficult to perform a characteristic dictated by cages social and political views the difficulty would ensure that a performance would show that the impossible is not impossible97this being cages answer to the notion that solving the worlds political and social problems is impossible98 cage described himself as an anarchist and was influenced by henry david thoreaue another series of works applied chance procedures to preexisting music by other composers cheap imitation 1969 based on erik satie some of the harmony of maine 1978 based on belcher and hymns and variations 1979 in these works cage would borrow the rhythmic structure of the originals and fill it with pitches determined through chance procedures or just replace some of the originals pitches100 yet another series of works the socalled number pieces all completed during the last five years of the composers life make use of time brackets the score consists of short fragments with indications of when to start and to end them eg from anywhere between 115 and 145 and to anywhere from 200 to 230101 cages method of using the i ching was far from simple randomization the procedures varied from composition to composition and were usually complex for example in the case of cheap imitation the exact questions asked to the i ching were these in another example of late music by cage etudes australes the compositional procedure involved placing a transparent strip on the star chart identifying the pitches from the chart transferring them to paper then asking the i ching which of these pitches were to remain single and which should become parts of aggregates chords and the aggregates were selected from a table of some 550 possible aggregates compiled beforehand96103 finally some of cages works particularly those completed during the 1960s feature instructions to the performer rather than fully notated music the score of variations i 1958 presents the performer with six transparent squares one with points of various sizes five with five intersecting lines the performer combines the squares and uses lines and points as a coordinate system in which the lines are axes of various characteristics of the sounds such as lowest frequency simplest overtone structure etc104 some of cages graphic scores eg concert for piano and orchestra fontana mix both 1958 present the performer with similar difficulties still other works from the same period consist just of text instructions the score of 000 1962 also known as 433 no 2 consists of a single sentence in a situation provided with maximum amplification perform a disciplined action the first performance had cage write that sentence105 musicircus 1967 simply invites the performers to assemble and play together the first musicircus featured multiple performers and groups in a large space who were all to commence and stop playing at two particular time periods with instructions on when to play individually or in groups within these two periods the result was a mass superimposition of many different musics on top of one another as determined by chance distribution producing an event with a specifically theatric feel many musicircuses have subsequently been held and continue to occur even after cages death the english national opera eno became the first opera company to hold a cage musicircus on march 3 2012 at the london coliseum106107 the enos musicircus featured artists including led zeppelin bassist john paul jones and composer michael finnissy alongside eno music director edward gardner the eno community choir eno opera works singers and a collective of professional and amateur talents performing in the bars and front of house at londons coliseum opera house108 this concept of circus was to remain important to cage throughout his life and featured strongly in such pieces as roaratorio an irish circus on finnegans wake 1979 a manytiered rendering in sound of both his text writing for the second time through finnegans wake and traditional musical and field recordings made around ireland the piece was based on james joyces famous novel finnegans wake which was one of cages favorite books and one from which he derived texts for several more of his works since chance procedures were used by cage to eliminate the composers and the performers likes and dislikes from music cage disliked the concept of improvisation which is inevitably linked to the performers preferences in a number of works beginning in the 1970s he found ways to incorporate improvisation in child of tree 1975 and branches 1976 the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments for example the cactus the structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices as is the musical output the performers had no knowledge of the instruments in inlets 1977 the performers play large waterfilled conch shells by carefully tipping the shell several times it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside which produced sound yet as it is impossible to predict when this would happen the performers had to continue tipping the shells as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance109 although cage started painting in his youth he gave it up to concentrate on music instead his first mature visual project not wanting to say anything about marcel dates from 1969 the work comprises two lithographs and a group of what cage called plexigrams silk screen printing on plexiglas panels the panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces all governed by chance operations110 from 1978 to his death cage worked at crown point press producing series of prints every year the earliest project completed there was the etching score without parts 1978 created from fully notated instructions and based on various combinations of drawings by henry david thoreau this was followed the same year by seven day diary which cage drew with his eyes closed but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations finally thoreaus drawings informed the last works produced in 1978 signals111 between 1979 and 1982 cage produced a number of large series of prints changes and disappearances 197980 on the surface 198082 and dreau 1982 these were the last works in which he used engraving112 in 1983 he started using various unconventional materials such as cotton batting foam etc and then used stones and fire eninka variations ryoanji etc to create his visual works113 in 19881990 he produced watercolors at the mountain lake workshop in the 1980s cage participated in the mountain lake workshop an experimental art symposium directed by virginia tech professor ray kass in southwestern virginia there he produced a series of collaborative visual works that extended his interest in chance operations including largescale watercolor and print projects beginning in 1983 he worked with watercolors using methods such as controlled pours chancederived grids and painting around stones with brushes made from feathers techniques that emphasized indeterminacy within a structured process114 the workshops allowed cage to apply his musical concepts to visual art and this period became a notable part of his late visual art practice it is documented in the mountain lake symposium and workshop art in locale 2018115 the only film cage produced was one of the number pieces one11 commissioned by composer and film director henning lohner who worked with cage to produce and direct the 90minute monochrome film it was completed only weeks before his death in 1992 one11 consists entirely of images of chancedetermined play of electric light it premiered in cologne germany on september 19 1992 accompanied by the live performance of the orchestra piece 103 throughout his adult life cage was also active as lecturer and writer some of his lectures were included in several books he published the first of which was silence lectures and writings 1961 silence included not only simple lectures but also texts executed in experimental layouts and works such as lecture on nothing 1949 which were composed in rhythmic structures subsequent books also featured different types of content from lectures on music to poetrycages mesostics cage was also an avid amateur mycologist116 in the fall of 1969 he gave a lecture on the subject of edible mushrooms at the university of california davis as part of his music in dialogue course117 he cofounded the new york mycological society with four friends68 and his mycology collection is presently housed by the special collections department of the mchenry library at the university of california santa cruz cages prechance works particularly pieces from the late 1940s such as sonatas and interludes earned critical acclaim the sonatas were performed at carnegie hall in 1949 cages adoption of chance operations in 1951 cost him a number of friendships and led to numerous criticisms from fellow composers adherents of serialism such as pierre boulez and karlheinz stockhausen dismissed indeterminate music boulez who was once on friendly terms with cage criticized him for adoption of a philosophy tinged with orientalism that masks a basic weakness in compositional technique118 prominent critics of serialism such as the greek composer iannis xenakis were similarly hostile towards cage for xenakis the adoption of chance in music was an abuse of language and an abrogation of a composers function119 an article by teacher and critic michael steinberg tradition and responsibility criticized avantgarde music in general the rise of music that is totally without social commitment also increases the separation between composer and public and represents still another form of departure from tradition the cynicism with which this particular departure seems to have been made is perfectly symbolized in john cages account of a public lecture he had given later during the question period i gave one of six previously prepared answers regardless of the question asked this was a reflection of my engagement in zen while mr cages famous silent piece ie 433 or his landscapes for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artists power120 cages aesthetic position was criticized by among others prominent writer and critic douglas kahn in his 1999 book noise water meat a history of sound in the arts kahn acknowledged the influence cage had on culture but noted that one of the central effects of cages battery of silencing techniques was a silencing of the social121 while much of cages work remains controversial122123 his influence on countless composers artists and writers is notable124 after cage introduced chance procedures to his works boulez stockhausen and xenakis remained critical yet all adopted chance procedures in some of their works although in a much more restricted manner and stockhausens piano writing in his later klavierstcke was influenced by cages music of changes and david tudor125 other composers who adopted chance procedures in their works included witold lutosawski126 mauricio kagel127 and many others music in which some of the composition andor performance is left to chance was labelled aleatoric musica term popularized by pierre boulez helmut lachenmanns work was influenced by cages work with extended techniques128 cages rhythmic structure experiments and his interest in sound influenced a number of composers starting at first with his close american associates earle brown morton feldman and christian wolff and other american composers such as la monte young terry riley steve reich and philip glass and then spreading to europe129130131 for example many composers of the english experimental school acknowledge his influence132 michael parsons christopher hobbs john white133 gavin bryars who studied under cage briefly134 and howard skempton135 the japanese composer tru takemitsu has also cited cages influence136 in 1986 he received an honorary doctorate from the california institute of the arts137 cage is a 1989 kyoto prize laureate the prize was established by kazuo inamori138 the john cage award was endowed and established in 1992 by foundation for contemporary arts in honor of the late composer with recipients including meredith monk robert ashley and toshi ichiyanagi139 following cages death simon jeffes founder of the penguin cafe orchestra composed a piece entitled cage dead using a melody based on the notes contained in the title in the order they appear c a g e d e a and d140 cages influence was also acknowledged by rock acts such as sonic youth who performed some of the number pieces141 and stereolab who named a song after cage142 composer and rock and jazz guitarist frank zappa143 and various noise music artists and bands musicologist paul hegarty traced the origin of noise music to 433144 the development of electronic music was also influenced by cage in the mid1970s brian enos label obscure records released works by cage145 prepared piano which cage popularized is featured heavily on aphex twins 2001 album drukqs146 cages work as musicologist helped popularize erik saties music147148 and his friendship with abstract expressionist artists such as robert rauschenberg helped introduce his ideas into visual art cages ideas also found their way into sound design for example academy awardwinning sound designer gary rydstrom cited cages work as a major influence149 radiohead undertook a composing and performing collaboration with cunninghams dance troupe in 2003 because the musicgroups leader thom yorke considered cage one of his alltime art heroes150 in the tragically hips 2000 song tiger the lion from their album music work lyricist gord downie refers to cage and his theories151 in 2012 among a wide range of american and international centennial celebrations152153 an eightday festival was held in washington dc with venues found notably more among the citys art museums and universities than performance spaces earlier in the centennial year conductor michael tilson thomas presented cages song books with the san francisco symphony at carnegie hall in new york154155 another celebration came for instance in darmstadt germany which in july 2012 renamed its central station the john cage railway station during the term of its annual newmusic courses20 at the ruhrtriennale in germany heiner goebbels staged a production of europeras 1 2 in a 36000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of lecture on nothing created and performed by robert wilson156 jacaranda music had four concerts planned in santa monica california for the centennial week157158 john cage day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth a 2012 project was curated by juraj kojs to celebrate the centenary of cages birth titled on silence homage to cage it consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the globe such as kasia glowicka adrian knight and henry vega each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of cages famous 1952 opus 433 the program was supported by the foundation for emerging technologies and arts laura kuhn and the john cage trust159 in a homage to cages dance work the bill t jonesarnie zane dance company in july 2012 performed an engrossing piece called storytime it was modeled on cages 1958 work indeterminacy in which cage and then jones respectively sat alone onstage reading aloud series of oneminute stories theyd written dancers from joness company performed as jones read150 general information and catalogues
