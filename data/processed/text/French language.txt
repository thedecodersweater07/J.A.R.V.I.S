french franais fs or langue franaise l fsz is a romance language of the indoeuropean family like all other romance languages it descended from the vulgar latin of the roman empire french evolved from northern old galloromance a descendant of the latin spoken in northern gaul its closest relatives are the other langues dollanguages historically spoken in northern france and in southern belgium which french francien largely supplanted it was also influenced by native celtic languages of northern roman gaul and by the germanic frankish language of the postroman frankish invaders as a result of french and belgian colonialism from the 16th century onward it was introduced to new territories in the americas africa and asia and numerous frenchbased creole languages most notably haitian creole were developed a frenchspeaking person or nation may be referred to as francophone in both english and french french is an official language in 26 countries as well as one of the most geographically widespread languages in the world with speakers in about 50 countries4 most of these countries are members of the organisation internationale de la francophonie oif the community of 54 member states which share the use or teaching of french it is estimated to have about 310 million speakers of which about 74 million are native speakers5 it is spoken as a first language in descending order of the number of speakers in france canada quebec belgium wallonia and the brusselscapital region western switzerland romandy region parts of luxembourg and monaco6 meanwhile in francophone africa it is spoken mainly as a second language or lingua franca though it has also become a native language in a small number of urban areas in some north african countries like algeria despite not having official status it is also a first language among some upper classes of the population alongside the indigenous ones but only a second one among the general population7 in 2015 approximately 40 of the francophone population including l2 and partial speakers lived in europe 36 in subsaharan africa and the indian ocean 15 in north africa and the middle east 8 in the americas and 1 in asia and oceania8 french is the second most widely spoken mother tongue in the european union9 of europeans who speak other languages natively approximately onefifth are able to speak french as a second language10 many institutions of the eu use french as a working language along with english german and italian in some institutions french is the sole working language eg at the court of justice of the european union11 french is also the 22th most natively spoken language in the world12 the sixth most spoken language by total number of speakers and is among the top five most studied languages worldwide with about 120 million learners as of 20171314 french has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the united nations the european union the north atlantic treaty organization the world trade organization the international olympic committee the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee of the red cross french is a romance language meaning that it is descended primarily from vulgar latin that evolved out of the galloromance dialects spoken in northern france the languages early forms include old french and middle french due to roman rule latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of gaul as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character with grammatical differences from latin as spoken elsewhere some of which is attested in graffiti15 this local variety evolved into the galloromance tongues which include french and its closest relatives such as francoprovenal the evolution of latin in gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native celtic gaulish language which did not go extinct until the late sixth century long after the fall of the western roman empire16 because few latin speakers settled in rural areas during roman times latin there held little or no social value for the peasantry as a result 90 of the total population of gaul remained indigenous in origin the urban aristocracy who used latin for trade education or official uses would send their children to roman schools and administered lands for rome in the fifth century at the time of the collapse of the western roman empire the vast majority of the predominantly rural population remained gaulish speakers they shifted to latin as their native speech only one century after the frankish conquest of gaul adopting the prestige language of their urban literate elite this eventual spread of latin can be attributed to the social migration from the focus of urban power to villagecentred economies and legal serfdom171819 the gaulish language likely survived into the sixth century in france despite considerable romanization16 coexisting with latin gaulish helped shape the vulgar latin dialects that developed into french1916 contributing loanwords and calques including oui20 the word for yes21 sound changes shaped by gaulish influence222324 and influences in conjugation and word order212515 recent computational studies suggest that early gender shifts may have been motivated by the gender of the corresponding word in gaulish26 the estimated number of french words that can be attributed to gaulish is placed at 154 by the petit robert27 which is often viewed as representing standardized french while if nonstandard dialects are included the number increases to 24028 known gaulish loans are skewed toward certain semantic fields such as plant life chne bille etc animals mouton cheval etc nature boue etc domestic activities ex berceau farming and rural units of measure arpent lieue borne boisseau weapons29 and products traded regionally rather than further afield30 this semantic distribution has been attributed to peasants being the last to hold onto gaulish3029 the beginning of french in gaul was greatly influenced by germanic invasions into the country these invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there31 a language divide began to grow across the country the population in the north spoke langue dol while the population in the south spoke langue doc31 langue dol grew into what is known as old french the period of old french spanned between the late 8th32 and mid14th centuries old french shared many characteristics with latin for example old french made use of different possible word orders just as latin did because it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique nonsubjects33 the period is marked by a heavy superstrate influence from the germanic frankish language which nonexhaustively included the use in upperclass speech and higher registers of v2 word order34 a large percentage of the vocabulary now at around 15 of modern french vocabulary35 including the impersonal singular pronoun on a calque of germanic man and the name of the language itself up until its later stages old french alongside old occitan maintained a relic of the old nominal case system of latin longer than most other romance languages with the notable exception of romanian which still currently maintains a case distinction differentiating between an oblique case and a nominative case the phonology was characterized by heavy syllabic stress which led to the emergence of various complicated diphthongs such as eau which would later be leveled to monophthongscitation needed the earliest evidence of what became old french can be seen in the oaths of strasbourg and the sequence of saint eulalia while old french literature began to be produced in the eleventh century with major early works often focusing on the lives of saints such as the vie de saint alexis or wars and royal courts notably including the chanson de roland epic cycles focused on king arthur and his court as well as a cycle focused on william of orangecitation needed during the period of the crusades french became so dominant in the mediterranean sea that it became a lingua franca frankish language and because of increased contact with the arabs during the crusades who referred to themwho as franj numerous arabic loanwords entered french such as amiral admiral alcool alcohol coton cotton and sirop syrop as well as scientific terms such as algbre algebra alchimie alchemy and zro zero36 within old french many dialects emerged but the francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the middle french period 14th17th centuries31 modern french grew out of this francien dialect31 grammatically during the period of middle french noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules robert estienne published the first latinfrench dictionary which included information about phonetics etymology and grammar37 politically the first government authority to adopt modern french as official was the aosta valley in 1536 while the ordinance of villerscotterts 1539 named french the language of law in the kingdom of france during the 17th century french replaced latin as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations lingua franca it retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century when it was replaced by english as the united states became the dominant global power following the second world war3839 stanley meisler of the los angeles times said that the fact that the treaty of versailles was written in english as well as french was the first diplomatic blow against the language40 during the grand sicle 17th century france under the rule of powerful leaders such as cardinal richelieu and louis xiv enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among european nations richelieu established the acadmie franaise to protect the french language by the early 1800s parisian french had become the primary language of the aristocracy in france near the beginning of the 19th century the french government began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages patois spoken in france this began in 1794 with henri grgoires report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the french language41 when public education was made compulsory only french was taught and the use of any other patois language was punished the goals of the public school system were made especially clear to the frenchspeaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as occitania and brittany instructions given by a french official to teachers in the department of finistre in western brittany included the following and remember gents you were given your position in order to kill the breton language42 the prefect of bassespyrnes in the french basque country wrote in 1846 our schools in the basque country are particularly meant to replace the basque language with french42 students were taught that their ancestral languages were inferior and they should be ashamed of them this process was known in the occitanspeaking region as vergonha43 in the 21st century the french language has undergone significant transformations in both linguistic and sociopolitical contexts linguistically french is increasingly shaped by regional variations particularly those emerging from subsaharan africa youth sociolects and vernacular influences such as camfranglais in cameroon and nouchi in cte divoire have given rise to hybrid linguistic forms that not only dominate local informal communication but are also gaining traction in francophone popular culture music and social media across the broader francosphere444546 while there is significant variation in spoken french written french stays largely consistent while french is a significant language on the internet ranking fourth only approximately 655 of francophones have access to the internet4748 in the 21st century french remains a major language for business diplomacy and culture though its use geography and sociopolitical context continues to shift with declines in some areas including academia and growth in others4849 on a global scale the number of french speakers continues to rise largely attributable to demographic growth in subsaharan africa where french serves as an official educational and administrative language in numerous states french now serves as a language of instruction in the educational systems serving approximately 93 million pupils from 36 countries and governments worldwide 24 of which are located in the africaindian ocean and middle east regions either as the sole language or in combination with others4748 notably 80 of students attending frenchlanguage schools are in africa where french is commonly used both for teaching and as a shared means of communication among different communities4748 the majority of francophones in the subsaharan region and the maghreb are young and are found in the 1524 age group4748 this growth contrasts with the declining presence of french in parts of asia particularly in former french colonies such as vietnam laos and cambodia where it has been largely replaced by local languages and english in both public life and education though significant immigrant populations from these regions continue in france and other francophone regions474850 in sociopolitical terms french remains deeply entangled in debates over language identity and historical legacy in the republic of the congo the democratic republic of the congo cte divoire and cameroon among others french remains the undisputed language of government formal education and major media the 2022 oif report highlights that in kinshasa brazzaville abidjan and yaound french serves as the dominant vehicular language so entrenched that many urban children acquire it alongside local vernaculars as a de facto first language4748 several sahelian states have formally curtailed french as part of postcolonial languageplanning many governments and residents perceive it to be a remnant of colonial rule in a complex context of cultural and political sovereignty discussions local and russian propaganda political and military conflicts and other factors47485152535455 in july 2023 malis constitutional referendum demoted french from official to merely working status while elevating thirteen indigenous tongues to constitutional parity56 burkina fasos transitional authorities have announced similar plans to strip french of its official role framing these moves as assertions of cultural sovereignty as well as a closer relationship to russian than france57 yet in both bamako and ouagadougou french endures as the lingua franca of higher education national media and interethnic commerce the language being primarily spoken by secondarylanguage speakers who have mixed use of the language but reflecting the complicated role of the language in these contexts amidst french military withdrawal in africa rising nationalism shifting alliances and other factors58594748 in longstanding francophone strongholds policymakers now seek a more balanced multilingual landscape senegals government has expanded woloflanguage programming on public television and begun renaming colonialera names in dakar even though french remains the sole constitutional language and continues to dominate academia60 this reflects a real commitment seen in senegal and elsewhere to shift from french to local languages or english616263 algeria has mandated arabicmedium instruction in formerly francophone private schools and introduced english tracks at its universities framed as part of a broader multilingual strategy but in the context of diplomatic issues with france yet french persists in judicial proceedings international business and everyday urban speech in algiers and oran and debate continues internally on language in the country646566 meanwhile in morocco and tunisia french continues to enjoy high prestige both governments maintain bilingual curricula in secondary and tertiary education and french remains the lingua franca of tourism scientific research and many privatesector enterprises4748 qubec has doubled down on french through bill 96 an act respecting french the official and common language of qubec assented on 1 june 2022 bill 96 reaffirms french as the provinces sole official language tightens requirements for french language services and commercial signage and expands the charter of the french languages scope which are measures designed to counter anglophone pressures and reinforce cultural identity67 similarly countries such as madagascar central african republic chad and haiti have legally committed to french alongside local languages686970 overall french remains a practical and widely accepted medium of communication particularly where linguistic diversity demands a neutral lingua franca4748 despite regional tensions or reductions in certain contexts french continues to expand as a global language of diplomacy development and multilateral cooperation4748 several nonfrancophone countries including rwanda ethiopia ghana and even countries outside africa such as moldova and the united arab emirates have joined or expanded their involvement in the organisation internationale de la francophonie oif71 their participation reflects an interest in leveraging french for international diplomacy educational exchange and regional economic integration474872 french is also used for collaboration on public health economic development business and local governance including through the association internationale des maires francophones aimf and other organizations737475 francophone collaboration today spans an increasingly diverse set of domains in media international broadcasters such as tv5monde radio france internationale rfi and france 24 play key roles in disseminating frenchlanguage content worldwide especially across africa europe the middle east and the caribbean7677 in education institutions like the agence universitaire de la francophonie auf and espace francophone pour la recherche le dveloppement et linnovation support research and academic partnerships between francophone universities across five continents7879 in culture the arts and sports events like the jeux de la francophonie foster artistic exchange and culture and reflect increased francophone art and culture emerging outside of europe and used in local communities around the world including new francophone social media francophone cinema tv francophone literature art francophone music and sport80818283 spoken by 1971 of the european unions population french is the third most widely spoken language in the eu after english and german and the secondmostwidely taught language after english985 under the constitution of france french has been the official language of

population lives in africa while it is an official language in 18 countries it is not spoken as a first language by the majority acting mainly as a second one or a lingua franca due to the many indigenous languages spoken in the territories93 according to a 2023 estimate from the organisation internationale de la francophonie an estimated 167 million african people spread across 35 countries and territoriesb can speak french as either a first or a second language9495 only 12 million of these spoke it as a first language according to ethnologue96 this number does not include the people living in nonfrancophone african countries who have learned french as a foreign language there is not a single african french but multiple forms that diverged through contact with various indigenous african languages97 language and slang from francophone africa particularly as popularized through music are playing a growing role in influencing french across the francophone world98 while spoken mainly as a second language french is increasingly being spoken as a native language in francophone africa among some communities in urban areas or the elite class this is especially true in the cities of abidjan99100 kinshasa and lubumbashi101102103104 douala105106 libreville107108 antananarivo109 cotonou110 and brazzaville111 however in contrast to central africa and most of west africa where french had been entrenched countries in north africa and the sahel have generally distanced themselves from the language due to colonial connections112 for example algeria intermittently attempted to remove the use of french in favor of a strong native language see arabization and french has recently also been removed as an official language in mali burkina faso and niger in 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively113114115 despite these changes and the emergence of english as a global lingua franca french today remains a major language in the societies of morocco algeria and tunisia116 due to the rise of french in africa the total frenchspeaking population worldwide is expected to reach 700 million people in 2050117118119 french was the fastest growing language on the continent in terms of either official or foreign languages120121 subsaharan africa is the region where the french language is most likely to expand because of the expansion of education and rapid population growth122 it is also where the language has evolved the most in recent years123124 some vernacular forms of french in africa can be difficult to understand for french speakers from other countries125 but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the frenchspeaking world french is the second most commonly spoken language in canada and one of two federal official languages alongside english as of the 2021 canadian census it was the native language of 77 million people 21 of the population and the second language of 29 million 8 of the population126127 although french is

ontario128129 french is the sole official language in the province of quebec where some 80 of the population speak it as a native language and 95 are capable of conducting a conversation in it126 quebec is also home to the city of montreal which is the worlds fourthlargest frenchspeaking city by number of first language speakers130131 new brunswick and manitoba are the only officially bilingual provinces though full bilingualism is enacted only in new brunswick where about one third of the population is francophone french is also an official language of all of the territories northwest territories nunavut and yukon out of the three yukon has the most french speakers making up just under 4 of the population132 furthermore while french is not an official language in ontario the french language services act ensures that provincial services are available in the language the act applies to areas of the province where there are significant francophone communities namely eastern ontario and northern ontario elsewhere sizable frenchspeaking minorities are found in southern manitoba nova scotia prince edward island and the port au port peninsula in newfoundland and labrador where the unique newfoundland french dialect was historically spoken smaller pockets of french speakers exist in all other provinces the ontarian city of ottawa the canadian capital is also

widespread second language among the lebanese people and is taught in many schools along with arabic and english french is used on lebanese pound banknotes on road signs on lebanese license plates and

according to a demographic projection led by the universit laval and the rseau dmographie de lagence universitaire de la francophonie the total number of french speakers will reach approximately 500 million in 2025 and 650 million by 2050 largely due to rapid population growth in subsaharan africa156 oif estimates 700 million french speakers by 2050 80 of whom will be in africa8 in a study

could be the language of the future164 however some african countries such as algeria intermittently attempted to eradicate the use of french and in 2024 and 2025 it was removed as an official language in mali burkina faso and niger113114 significant as a judicial language french is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts tribunals and disputesettlement

court of human rightss two working languages165 in 1997 george weber published in language today a comprehensive academic study entitled the worlds 10 most influential languages in the article weber ranked french as after english the secondmost influential language of the world ahead of spanish his criteria were the numbers of native speakers the number of secondary speakers especially high for french among fellow world languages the number of countries using the language and their respective populations the economic power of the countries using the language the number of major areas in which the language is used and the linguistic prestige associated with the mastery of the language weber highlighted that french in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige in a 2008 reassessment of his article weber concluded that his findings were still correct since the situation among the top ten remains unchanged166 knowledge of french is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the united kingdom a 2014 study found that 50 of british managers considered french to be a valuable asset for their business thus ranking french as the most soughtafter foreign language there ahead of german 49 and spanish 44167 mit economist albert saiz calculated a 23 premium for those who have french as a foreign language in the workplace168 in 2011 bloomberg businessweek ranked french the third most useful language for business after english and standard mandarin chinese169 in englishspeaking canada the united kingdom and ireland french is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages in the united states french is the secondmost commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities although well behind spanish in some areas of the country near frenchspeaking quebec however it is the foreign language more commonly taught vowel phonemes in french although there are many french regional accents foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language french pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling but french spelling is often based more on history than phonology the rules for pronunciation vary between dialects but the standard rules are french is written with the 26 letters of the basic latin script with four diacritics appearing on vowels circumflex accent acute accent grave accent diaeresis and the cedilla appearing in there are two ligatures and but they are often replaced in contemporary french with oe and ae because the ligatures do not appear on the azerty keyboard layout used in frenchspeaking countries however thisambiguous is nonstandard in formal and literary texts french spelling like english spelling tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules this is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the old french period without a corresponding change in spelling moreover some conscious changes were made to restore latin orthography as with some english words such as debt french orthography is morphophonemic while it contains 130 graphemes that denote only 36 phonemes many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes170 many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound in particular a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme however there is not a onetoone relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme which can be seen in how tomber and tomb both end with the e phoneme171 additionally there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words demonstrated by how the x in paix is not pronounced though at the end of aix it is as a result it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound final consonants are generally silent except when the following word begins with a vowel see liaison french for example the following words end in a vowel sound pied aller les finit beaux the same words followed by a vowel however may sound the consonants as they do in these examples beauxarts les amis piedterre french writing as with any language is affected by the spoken language in old french the plural for animal was animals the als sequence was unstablefurther explanation needed and was turned into a diphthong aus this change was then reflected in the orthography animaus the us ending very common in latin was then abbreviated by copyists monks to the letter x resulting in a written form animax as the french language further evolved the pronunciation of au turned into o so that the u was reestablished in orthography for consistency resulting in modern french animaux pronounced first animos before the final s was dropped in contemporary french the same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others in addition castel pl castels became chteau pl chteaux some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system but they still fail to gather interest172173174175 in 1990 a reform accepted some changes to french orthography at the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions in 2016 schoolbooks in france began to use the newer recommended spellings with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct176 french is a moderately inflected language nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number singular or plural though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently adjectives for number and gender masculine or feminine of their nouns personal pronouns and a few other pronouns for person number gender and case and verbs for tense aspect mood and the person and number of their subjects case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions while certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs according to the french lexicogrammatical system french has a rankscale hierarchy with clause as the top rank which is followed by group rank word rank and morpheme rank a french clause is made up of groups groups are made up of words and lastly words are made up of morphemes177 french grammar shares several notable features with most other romance languages including every french noun is either masculine or feminine because french nouns are not inflected for gender a nouns form cannot specify its gender for nouns regarding the living their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to for example a male teacher is an enseignant while a female teacher is an enseignante however plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine so a group of two male teachers would be enseignants a group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be enseignants however a group of two female teachers would be enseignantes in many situations including in the case of enseignant both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically the article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech for example the singular le professeur or la professeure the male or female teacher professor can be distinguished from the plural les professeures because le l la la and les les are all pronounced differently with enseignant however for both singular forms the lela becomes l and so the only difference in pronunciation is that the t on the end of masculine form is silent whereas it is pronounced in the feminine if the word was to be followed by a word starting with a vowel then liaison would cause the t to be pronounced in both forms resulting in identical pronunciation there are also some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference for example le dentiste refers to a male dentist while la dentiste refers to a female dentist furthermore a few nouns meanings depend on their gender for example un livre masculine refers to a book while une livre a feminine is a pound the french language consists of both finite and nonfinite moods the finite moods include the indicative mood indicatif the subjunctive mood subjonctif the imperative mood impratif and the conditional mood conditionnel the nonfinite moods include the infinitive mood infinitif the present participle participe prsent and the past participle participe pass the indicative mood makes use of eight tenseaspect forms these include the present prsent the simple past pass compos and pass simple the past imperfective imparfait the pluperfect plusqueparfait the simple future futur simple the future perfect futur antrieur and the past perfect pass antrieur some forms are less commonly used today in todays spoken french the pass compos is used while the pass simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes similarly the plusqueparfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass antrieur seen in literary works within the indicative mood the pass compos plusqueparfait futur antrieur and pass antrieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms the subjunctive mood only includes four of the tenseaspect forms found in the indicative present prsent simple past pass compos past imperfective imparfait and pluperfect plusqueparfait within the subjunctive mood the pass compos and plusqueparfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms the imperative is used in the present tense with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense the imperative is used to give commands to you tu weus nous and plural you vous the conditional makes use of the present prsent and the past pass the pass uses auxiliary verbs in its forms french uses both the active voice and the passive voice the active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb tre to be and the past participle example of the active voice example of the passive voice however unless the subject of the sentence is specified generally the pronoun on one is used word order is subjectverbobject although a pronoun object precedes the verb some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders in particular inversion of the subject and verb as in parlezvous franais when asking a question rather than vous parlez franais both formulations are used and carry a rising inflection on the last word the literal english translations are do you speak french and you speak french respectively to avoid inversion while asking a question estce que literally is it that may be placed at the beginning of the sentence parlezvous franais may become estce que vous parlez franais french also uses verbobjectsubject vos and objectsubjectverb osv word order osv word order is not used often and vos is reserved for formal writings33 the majority of french words derive from vulgar latin or were constructed from latin or greek roots in many cases a single etymological root appears in french in a popular or native form inherited from vulgar latin and a learned form borrowed later from classical latin the following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective however a historical tendency to gallicise latin roots can be identified whereas english conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the latin there are also nounnoun and adjectiveadjective pairs it can be difficult to identify the latin source of native french words because in the evolution from vulgar latin unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications more recently 1994 the linguistic policy toubon law of the french language academies of france and quebec has been to provide french equivalents179 to mainly english imported words either by using existing vocabulary extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to french morphological rules the result is often two or more coexisting terms for describing the same phenomenon it is estimated that 12 4200 of common french words found in a typical dictionary such as the petit larousse or microrobert plus 35000 words are of foreign origin where greek and latin learned words are not seen as foreign about 25 1054 of these foreign words come from english and are fairly recent borrowings the others are some 707 words from italian 550 from ancient germanic languages 481 from other galloromance languages 215 from arabic 164 from german 160 from celtic languages 159 from spanish 153 from dutch 112 from persian and sanskrit 101 from native american languages 89 from other asian languages 56 from other afroasiatic languages 55 from baltoslavic languages 10 from basque and 144 about 3 from other languages178 one study analyzing the similarity of seven romance languages to vulgar latin in terms of accent vocalization estimated that among the languages analyzed french was the most differentiated language from vulgar latin in this respect180 the french languages lexical similarity to a selection of other romance languages is 89 with italian 80 with sardinian 78 with rhaetoromance and 75 with romanian spanish and portuguese1811 the numeral system used in the majority of francophone countries employs both decimal and vigesimal counting after the use of unique names for the numbers 116 those from 17 to 69 are counted by tens while twenty vingt is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99 the french word for 80 is quatrevingts literally four twenties and the word for 75 is soixantequinze literally sixtyfifteen the vigesimal method of counting is analogous to the archaic english use of score as in fourscore and seven 87 or threescore and ten 70 belgian swiss and aostan french182 as well as that used in the democratic republic of the congo rwanda and burundi use different names for 70 and 90 namely septante and nonante in switzerland depending on the local dialect 80 can be quatrevingts geneva neuchtel jura or huitante vaud valais fribourg the aosta valley similarly uses huitante182 for 80 conversely belgium and in its former african colonies use quatrevingts for 80 in old french during the middle ages all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20 eg vint et doze twenty and twelve for 32 dous vinz et diz two twenties and ten for 50 uitante for 80 or nonante for 90183 the term octante was historically used in switzerland for 80 but is now considered archaic184 french like most european languages uses a space to separate thousands185 the comma french virgule is used in french numbers as a decimal point ie 25 instead of 25 in the case of currencies the currency markers are substituted for decimal point ie 57 for 5 dollars and 7 cents article 1 of the universal declaration of human rights in french article 1 of the universal declaration of human rights in english
