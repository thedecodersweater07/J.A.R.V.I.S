the durand line pashto urdu dari also known as the afghanistanpakistan border is a 2640kilometre 1640 mi international border between afghanistan and pakistan1a the western end runs to the border with iran and the eastern end to the border with china the durand line was established in 1893 as the international border between the emirate of afghanistan and the british indian empire by mortimer durand a british diplomat of the indian civil service and abdur rahman khan the emir of afghanistan to fix the limit of their respective spheres of influence and improve diplomatic relations and trade britain considered afghanistan to be an independent state at the time although they controlled its foreign affairs and diplomatic relations the singlepage agreement dated 12 november 1893 contains seven short articles including a commitment not to exercise interference beyond the durand line2 a joint britishafghan demarcation survey took place starting from 1894 covering some 800 miles 1300 km of the border34 established towards the end of the britishrussian great game rivalry the resulting line established afghanistan as a buffer zone between british and russian interests in the region5 the line as slightly modified and ratified by the angloafghan treaty of 1919 was inherited by pakistan in 1947 following its independence the durand line cuts through to demarcate khyber pakhtunkhwa balochistan and the contested region of gilgitbaltistan of northern and western pakistan from the northeastern and southern provinces of afghanistan from a geopolitical and geostrategic perspective it has been described as one of the most dangerous borders in the world6789 although the durand line is internationally recognized as the western border of pakistan it remains unrecognized in afghanistan1011121314 sardar mohammed daoud khan former prime minister and president of afghanistan vigorously opposed the border and launched a propaganda war however bhutto made a proposal in august 1976 that if he pardons the leaders of the national awami party then daoud khan must simultaneously announce that afghanistan has no territorial claims on pakistan and is prepared to recognise the durand line bhutto however also disclosed to american diplomats that he feared that the afghans may go back on their word15 following the second round of talks daoud publicly announced his willingness to recognise the border as part of the afghan concession however the following negotiations were stalled after bhutto was overthrown a year later and following the overthrow of daoud khan in 1978 the new pdpa government back to the hardline stance on the durand line claiming that afghanistans borders extended up until the indus river essentially claiming more than half of pakistan16171819 in 2017 amid crossborder tensions former afghan president hamid karzai said that afghanistan will never recognise the durand line as the border between the two countries20 the area through which the durand line runs has been inhabited by the indigenous pashtuns21 since ancient times at least since 500 bc the greek historian herodotus mentioned a people called pactyans living in and around arachosia as early as the 1st millennium bc22 the baloch tribes inhabit the southern end of the line which runs in the balochistan region that separates the ethnic baloch people arab muslims conquered the area in the 7th century and introduced islam to the pashtuns it is believed that some of the early arabs also settled among the pashtuns in the sulaiman mountains23 these pashtuns were historically known as afghans and are believed to be mentioned by that name in arabic chronicles as early as the 10th century24 the pashtun area known today as the pashtunistan region fell within the ghaznavid empire in the 10th century followed by the ghurids timurids mughals hotakis by the durranis and thereafter the sikhs25 in 1839 during the first angloafghan war britishled indian forces invaded afghanistan and initiated a war with the afghan rulers two years later in 1842 the british were defeated and the war ended the british again invaded afghanistan in 1878 during the second angloafghan war the british decided to accept a new amir who was a british opponent abdur rahman khan and the treaty of gandamak was signed in 1880 afghanistan ceded control of various frontier areas to india the british failed in their objective to maintain a british resident in kabul but having attained their other geopolitical objectives the british withdrew in 1893 mortimer durand was dispatched to kabul by the government of india to sign an agreement with amir abdur rahman khan for fixing the limits of their respective spheres of influence as well as improving diplomatic relations and trade on 12 november 1893 the durand line agreement was reached2 the two parties later camped at parachinar a small town near khost in afghanistan which is now part of the federally administered tribal areas fata of pakistan to delineate the frontiercitation needed from the britishindian side the camp was attended by mortimer durand and sahibzada abdul qayyum political agent khyber agency representing the viceroy of india and governor general of indiacitation needed the afghan side was represented by sahibzada abdul latif and a former governor of khost province in afghanistan sardar shireendil khan representing amir abdur rahman khancitation needed the original 1893 durand line agreement was written in english with translated copies in dari the resulting agreement or treaty led to the creation of a new province called the northwest frontier province now known as khyber pakhtunkhwa a province of pakistan which includes fata and the frontier regions it also led to afghanistan receiving nuristan and wakhan the initial and primary demarcation a joint indoafghan survey and mapping effort covered 1300 kilometres 800 mi and took place from 1894 to 1896 detailed topographic maps locating hundreds of boundary demarcation pillars were soon published and are available in the survey of india collection at the british library26 the complete 20page text of these detailed joint indoafghan demarcation surveys is available in several sources2728 in 1896 the long stretch from the kabul river to china including the wakhan corridor was declared demarcated by virtue of its continuous distinct watershed ridgeline leaving only the section near the khyber pass to be finally demarcated in the treaty of 22 november 1921 signed by mahmud tarzi chief of the afghan government for the conclusion of the treaty and henry r c dobbs envoy extraordinary and chief of the british mission to kabul27 a very short adjustment to the demarcation was made at arundu arnawai in 193334427 shortly after demarcation of the durand line the british began connecting the region on their side of the durand line to the north western state railway meanwhile abdur rahman khan conquered the nuristanis and made them muslims concurrently afridi tribesmen began rising up in arms against the british creating a zone of instability between peshawar and the durand line further frequent skirmishes and wars between the afghanistan and india starting in the 1870s made travel between peshawar and jalalabad almost impossible as a result travel across the boundary was almost entirely halted further the british recruited tens of thousands of local pashtuns into the indian army and stationed them throughout india and southeast asia exposure to india combined with the ease of travel eastwards into punjab and the difficulty of travel towards afghanistan led many pashtuns to orient themselves towards the heartlands of british india and away from kabul by the time of indian independence political opinion was divided into those who supported a homeland for muslim indians in the shape of pakistan those who supported reunification with afghanistan and those who believed that a united india would be a better option the durand line triggered a longrunning controversy between the governments of afghanistan and british india2 especially after the outbreak of the third angloafghan war when afghanistans capital kabul and its eastern city of jalalabad were bombed by the no 31 and no 114 squadrons of the british royal air force in may 19192930 afghan rulers reaffirmed in the 1919 1921 and 1930 treaties to accept the indoafghan frontier312732 the afghan government accepts the indoafghan frontier accepted by the late amir article v of the august 8 1919 treaty of rawalpindi the two high contracting parties mutually accept the indoafghan frontier as accepted by the afghan government under article v of the treaty concluded on august 8 1919 article ii of the november 22 1921 finalising of the treaty of rawalpindi pakistan inherited the 1893 agreement and the subsequent 1919 treaty of rawalpindi after the partition from the british india in 1947 there has never been a formal agreement or ratification between islamabad and kabul33 pakistan believes and international convention under uti possidetis juris supports the position that it should not require an agreement to set the boundary31 courts in several countries around the world and the vienna convention have universally upheld via uti possidetis juris that binding bilateral agreements are passed down to successor states34 thus a unilateral declaration by one party has no effect boundary changes must be made bilaterally35 at the time of independence the indigenous pashtun people21 living on the border with afghanistan were given only the choice of becoming a part either of india or pakistan6 further by the time of the indian independence movement prominent pashtun nationalists such as abdul ghaffar khan and his khudai khidmatgar movement advocated a united india and not a united afghanistan highlighting the extent to which infrastructure and instability together began to erode pashtun selfidentification with afghanistan36 by the time of independence popular opinion amongst pashtuns was split amongst the majority who wished to join the newly formed state of pakistan and the minority who wished to become a part of the dominion of india when the idea of a united india failed ghaffar khan pledged allegiance to pakistan and started campaigning for the autonomy of pakistans pashtuns36 on 26 july 1949 when afghanpakistan relations were rapidly deteriorating a loya jirga was held in afghanistan after a military aircraft from the pakistan air force bombed a village on the afghan side of the durand line in response to crossborder fire from the afghan side in response the afghan government declared that it recognised neither the imaginary durand nor any similar line and that all previous durand line agreements were void37 they also announced that the durand ethnic division line had been imposed on them under coercionduress and was a diktat this had no tangible effect as there has never been a move in the united nations to enforce such a declaration due to both nations being constantly busy in wars with their other neighbours see indopakistani wars and civil war in afghanistan in 1950 the house of commons of the united kingdom held its view on the afghanpakistan dispute over the durand line by stating his majestys government in the united kingdom has seen with regret the disagreements between the governments of pakistan and afghanistan about the status of the territories on the north west frontier it is his majestys governments view that pakistan is in international law the inheritor of the rights and duties of the old government of india and of his majestys government in the united kingdom in these territories and that the durand line is the international frontier38 philip noelbaker june 30 1950 at the 1956 seato southeast asia treaty organization ministerial council meeting held at karachi capital of pakistan at the time it was stated the members of the council declared that their governments recognised that the sovereignty of pakistan extends up to the durand line the international boundary between pakistan and afghanistan and it was consequently affirmed that the treaty area referred to in articles iv and viii of the treaty includes the area up to that line39 seato march 8 1956 in june 1976 a summit was held between the governments of pakistan and afghanistan which both sides made concessions pakistan publicly recognising the existence of the pashtunistan question which was a key part of afghan foreign policy for decades and the afghans were willing to hold highlevel bilateral talks without bringing up the subject regarding the fate of wali khan and his banned national awami party in pakistan which the pakistanis considered as internal matters1640 the border is south of the hindu kush while its eastern end by china is in the karakoram range these are regions of extreme high elevation hence much of the durand line is bounded by mountains the spn ghar white mountains range is roughly in the middle of the line the western part of the line meanwhile is lower and sparse consisting of the registan desert the highest peak noshaq is located along the border between two countries while some of the highest peaks in the world including k2 are a short distance to the east of the lines end on the pakistani side the kunar river kabul river kurram river and gomal river all cross the durand line at the very western end of the line is the godzareh depression the border is 2611 km 1622 mi long twelve afghan provinces are located along the border nimroz helmand kandahar zabul paktika khost paktia logar nangarhar kunar nuristan and badakhshan khyber pakhtunkhwa balochistan and the gilgitbaltistan region of pakistan share a border with the durand line the two countries are major trade partners and therefore the various border crossings are economically important for the wider region41 particularly the torkham and khyber pass that is also the main land connection between central asia and the indian subcontinent during operation cyclone the isi with support and funding from the central intelligence agency cia of the united states recruited mujahideen militant groups on the pakistani side of the durand line to cross into afghanistans territory for missions to topple the sovietbacked afghan government42 afghanistan khad was one of two secret service agencies believed to have been conducting bombings in parts of the north west frontier now khyber pakhtunkhwa during the early 1980s43 us state department blamed wad a kgbcreated afghan secret intelligence agency for terrorist bombings in pakistans cities in 1987 and 19884445 it is also believed that afghanistans pdpa government supported the leftist alzulfiqar organization of pakistan the group accused of the 1981 hijacking of a pakistan international airlines plane from karachi to kabul after the collapse of the prosoviet afghan government in 1992 pakistan despite article 2 of the durand line agreement which states the government of india will at no time exercise interference in the territories lying beyond this line on the side of afghanistan attempted to create a state friendly to pakistan in afghanistan prior to taliban control according to us special envoy on afghanistan peter tomsen46 according to a summer 2001 report in the friday times even the taliban leaders challenged the very existence of the durand line when former afghan interior minister abdur razzaq and a delegation of about 95 taliban visited pakistan47 the taliban refused to endorse the durand line despite pressure from islamabad arguing that there shall be no borders among muslims when the taliban government was removed in late 2001 the afghan president hamid karzai also began resisting the durand line48 and today the present government of afghanistan does not recognize durand line as its international border no afghan government has recognized the durand line as its border since 19474950 a line of hatred that raised a wall between the two brothers hamid karzai the afghan geodesy and cartography head office agcho depicts the line on their maps as a de facto border including naming the durand line 2310 km 1893 as an international boundary line on their home page51 however a map in an article from the pashtundominated government of afghanistan not only refuses to recognise the durand line as the international border between the two countries it claims that the pashtun territories of pakistan rightly belong to afghanistan11 the durand line agreement makes no mention of a time limit thus suggesting the treaty has no expiry date in 2004 spokespersons of us state departments office of the geographer and global issues and british foreign and commonwealth office also pointed out that the durand line agreement has no mention of an expiry date recurrent claims that the durand treaty expired in 1993 are unfounded cartographic depictions of boundary conflict with each other but treaty depictions are clear33 a spokesperson for us state departments office of the geographer and global issues because the durand line divides the pashtun and baloch people it continues to be a source of tension between the governments of pakistan and afghanistan52 in august 2007 pakistani politician and the leader of jamiat ulemaeislam fazalurrehman urged afghanistan to recognise the durand line53 press statements from 2005 to 2007 by former pakistani president musharraf calling for the building of a fence on the durand line have been met with resistance from numerous pashtun political parties in afghanistan545556 pashtun politicians in afghanistan strenuously object to even the existence of the durand line border57 in 2006 afghan president hamid karzai warned that iran and pakistan and others are not fooling anyone if they dont stop the consequences will be that the region will suffer with us equally in the past we have suffered alone this time everybody will suffer with us any effort to divide afghanistan ethnically or weaken it will create the same thing in the neighboring countries all the countries in the neighborhood have the same ethnic groups that we have so they should know that it is a different ball game this time11 hamid karzai february 17 2006 aimal faizi spokesman for the afghan president stated in october 2012 that the durand line is an issue of historical importance for afghanistan the afghan people not the government can take a final decision on it10 in july 2003 pakistani and afghan forces clashed over border posts the afghan government claimed that the pakistani military established bases up to 600 meters inside afghanistan in the yaqubi area near bordering mohmand district58 the yaqubi and yaqubi kandao pass area were later found to fall within afghanistan59 in 2007 pakistan erected fences and posts a few hundred metres inside afghanistan near the borderstraddling bazaar of angoor ada in south waziristan but the afghan national army quickly removed them and began shelling pakistani positions58 leaders in pakistan said the fencing was a way to prevent taliban militants from crossing over between the two nations but afghan president hamid karzai believed that it is islamabads plan to permanently separate the pashtun tribes60 special forces from the united states army were based at shkin afghanistan seven kilometres west of angoor ada from 200261 in 2009 the international security assistance force isaf and american cia began using unmanned aerial vehicles from the afghan side to hit terrorist targets on the pakistani side of the durand line62 the border area between afghanistan and pakistan has long been one of the most dangerous places in the world due largely to very little government control it is legal and common in the region to carry guns and assault rifles and explosives are common63 many forms of illegal activities take place such as smuggling of weapons narcotics lumber copper gemstones marble vehicles and electronic products as well as ordinary consumer goods5264656667 kidnappings and murders are frequent8 militants frequently cross the border from both sides to conduct attacks68 in june 2011 more than 500 taliban militants entered upper dir area from afghanistan and killed more than 30 pakistani security forces police said the attackers targeted a checkpost destroyed two schools and several houses while killing a number of civilians69 the governments of pakistan and afghanistan are both trying to extend the rule of law into the border areas at the same time the united states is reviewing the reconstruction opportunity zones roz act in washington dc which is supposed to help the economic status of the pashtun and baloch tribes by providing jobs to a large number of the population on both sides of the durand line border70 much of the northern and central durand line is quite mountainous where crossing the border is often only practical in the numerous passes through the mountains border crossing is very common especially among pashtuns who cross to meet relatives or to work the movement of people across the border has largely been unchecked or uncontrolled52 although passports and visas are at times checked at official crossings in june 2011 the united states installed a biometric system at the border crossing near spin boldak aimed at improving the security situation and blocking the infiltration of insurgents into southern afghanistan71 throughout june and into july 2011 pakistan chitral scouts and local defence militias suffered deadly crossborder raids in response the pakistani military shelled some afghan villages in afghanistans nuristan kunar nangarhar and khost provinces resulting in a number of afghan civilians being killed72 afghanistans interior ministry claimed that nearly 800 rockets were fired from pakistan hitting civilian targets inside afghanistan73 the afghan statement claimed that attacks by pakistan resulted in the deaths of 42 afghan civilians including 30 men and 12 women and girls wounded 55 others and destroyed 120 homes although pakistan claimed it was an accident and just routine antitaliban operations some analysts believe that it could have been a show of strength by islamabad for example a senior official at the council on foreign relations explained that because the shelling was of such a large scale it was more likely a warning from pakistan than an accident74 im speculating but natural possibilities include a signal to karzai and to the united states that we cant push pakistan too hard74 stephen biddle the united states and other nato states often ignored this sensitive issue likely because of potential effects on their war strategy in afghanistan their involvement could have strained relations and jeopardized their own national interests in the area11 this came after the november 2011 nato bombing in which 24 pakistani soldiers were killed75 in response to that incident pakistan decided to cut off all nato supply lines as well as boost border security by installing antiaircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity76 regarding the durand line some rival maps are said to display discrepancies of as much as five kilometres77 in june 2016 pakistan announced that it had completed 1100 km of trenches along the pakistanafghanistan border durand line in balochistan to check movement of terrorists and smugglers across border into pakistan from afghanistan78 plans to expand this trench berm fence work were announced in march 201779 the plans also included building 338 checkpoints and forts along the border by 201980 on 16 february pakistan closed the border crossings at torkham and chaman due to security reasons following the sehwan blast8182 on 7 march the border was reopened for two days to facilitate the return of people to their respective countries who had earlier crossed the border on valid visas the decision was taken after repeated requests by afghanistans government to avert a humanitarian crisis8384 according to a pakistani official 24000 afghans returned to afghanistan while 700 pakistanis returned to pakistan before the border was indefinitely closed again85 on 20 march pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif ordered the reopening of afghanistanpakistan border as a goodwill gesture 32 days after it was closed8687 on 5 may following an attack on pakistani census team by afghan forces and the resulting exchange of fire between the two sides the border was closed again88 pakistans decision to close the border was to force afghanistan to take action against militant groups who were using afghanistans soil to carry out crossborder attacks against pakistan89 an afghan diplomat at the world trade organization wto claimed that afghanistan suffered a loss of 90 million us dollars as a result of closure of border by pakistan90 on 27 may 2017 pakistan reopened the border after a request from afghan authorities marking the end of the border closure that lasted 22 days91 pakistan has been constructing a border barrier since 2017 to prevent terrorism drug trafficking refugees illegal immigration smuggling and infiltration across the durand line92 according to pakistan the barrier is also necessary to block the infiltration of militants across the border93 by january 2019 900 km had been completed94 the durand line is marked by 235 crossing points many of which had been susceptible to illegal immigration the project is predicted to cost at least 532 million95 by 21 january 2022 the interior minister of pakistan stated that only 20 km of fencing remained and that it would be completed soon96 as of april 2023 98 of fencing and 85 of fortifications have been completed97
