the 1983 hindu kush earthquake occurred south of fayzabad badakhshan in northeast afghanistan at 0352 pst on december 31 1983 near the border with pakistan and the ussr now tajikistan striking 2145 km beneath the hindu kush mountains the moment magnitude 74 quake affected three countries1 killing at least 26 people and injuring several hundred3 the afghanistanpakistantajikistan border region lies within the broad zone of ongoing crustal deformation caused by continental collision between the indian plate and the eurasian plate the area is seismically active particularly as a result of faulting at just over 200 km depth within the downgoing slab producing intraplate earthquakes many large greater than magnitude 70 have been observed in the hindu kush all with similar epicenters with an approximate periodicity of about 1015 years these events have reverse fault focal mechanisms which for the nearvertical slab indicates active extension it has been proposed that these earthquakes are a result of necking of the downgoing slab a process that may eventually lead to breakoff4 smaller shallow focus earthquakes are also observed in the region particularly associated with northsouth trending zones of right lateral strikeslip such as the chaman fault with an increasing degree of shortening to the north together accommodating the highly oblique convergence between the indian plate and the eurasian plate5 the most recent large event of this type was the october 2015 hindu kush earthquake which killed over 300 people6 the earthquake of 1983 together with that of 1993 2002 and 2015 occurred in close proximity with each other events like these are considered an earthquake next the focal mechanism according to the us geological survey indicated intermediatedepth reverse faulting1 the seismogenic fault beneath the hindu kush is thought to have produced four magnitude 7375 earthquakes between 1949 and 2015 and two 70 events in 1974 and 1993 the magnitude 7375 earthquakes had an estimated 12 meters and 07 meters for the 70 earthquakes resulting in a total displacement of 62 meters along the same fault through 1949 and 2015 distributed across six earthquakes vertical necking or stretching of the rapidly moving 10 cmyr downgoing slab in the vicinity of the source fault encourages a high slip rate of 96 cmyear the estimated slip rate is much faster than the 1 cmyr convergent rate at the surface7 waveform inversion using the bayesian information criterion revealed the earthquake consisted of two subevents with the latter about 20 km 12 mi away from the first subevent the first event occurred near the hypocenter along the fault the latter subevent may have released seven times the seismic moment of the former8 two years after the 1983 quake the hindu kush region was hit with another magnitude 74 quake it struck with an epicenter 30 km southwest of the 1983 event at 987 km beneath the mountains five people died and 38 were injured in the chitral and swat districts of pakistan that quake triggered rockslides and avalanches throughout the hindu kush and himalaya region it had a maximum intensity of viii severe felt at khorog and qurgonteppa ussr the earthquake was also felt strongly at new delhi india9 a total of 26 people died 12 in kabul and samangan afghanistan and 14 at peshawar pakistan many died or were injured when their homes collapsed during their sleep several hundred people were injured in pakistan and 483 were reported in afghanistan eight members of one family were injured in lahore10 damage was also reported in the ussr now tajikistan3
