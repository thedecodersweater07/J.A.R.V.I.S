a 40kilometre 25 mi deep earthquake measuring magnitude mw 62 struck southeastern afghanistan on 22 june 2022 at 012436 aft on 21 june 2022 at 205436 utc2 the earthquake had a maximum modified mercalli intensity of ix violent there were 10521163 deaths and 16272976 injured in afghanistan and pakistan34 the worst affected provinces in afghanistan were paktika paktia khost and nangarhar casualties and damage also occurred in pakistans khyber pakhtunkhwa at least 10000 homes collapsed or were severely damaged5 the earthquakes shallow hypocenter proximity to populated areas and low building quality contributed to its destructive effects shaking was felt over 500 km 310 mi away by at least 119 million people6 including pakistans punjab and parts of india and iran78 more than 7000 people in afghanistan have been killed by earthquakes in the past decade averaging 560 deaths a year9 a major earthquake in 2015 in northeast afghanistan killed more than 200 people in the country and neighboring pakistan8 in 2008 a magnitude 64 earthquake in western pakistan killed 166 people and destroyed several villages from triggered landslides10 thousands died when earthquakes struck the country in 2002 and 199811 a large portion of afghanistan is situated in a broad zone of continental deformation within the eurasian plate seismic activity in afghanistan is influenced by the subduction of the arabian plate to the west and the oblique subduction of the indian plate in the east the subduction rate of the indian plate along the continental convergent boundary is estimated to be 39 mm 15 inyr or higher transpression due to the plates interacting is associated with high seismicity within the shallow crust seismicity is detectable to a depth of 300 km 190 mi beneath afghanistan due to plate subduction12 these earthquakes beneath the hindu kush are the result of movement on faults accommodating detachment of the subducted crust13 within the shallow crust the chaman fault represents a major transform fault associated with large shallow earthquakes that forms the transpressional boundary between the eurasian and indian plates this zone consists of seismically active thrust and strikeslip faults that have accommodated crustal deformation since the beginning of the formation of the himalayan orogeny seismicity is also recorded beneath the sulaiman range and spn ghar these earthquakes tend to display strikeslip faulting due to its abundance and high deformation rate14 the united states geological survey usgs recorded the shock as 60 mww at 4 km 25 mi depth10 it released an energy yield equivalent to 475000 tons of tnt37 times more powerful that the atomic bomb dropped over hiroshima15 the europeanmediterranean seismological centre reported the magnitude at 59 mw 16 and the global centroid moment tensor recorded 62 mw at 151 km 94 mi depth2 indias national centre for seismology recorded the event as m 61 at 10 km 62 mi depth17 the earthquake occurred in proximity to the north waziristanbannu thrust fault zone from inferring insar data the earthquake rupture process was complex initiating along a primary northeastsouthwest striking fault plane and triggering ruptures on three secondary fault planes branching outward a maximum slip of 2 m 6 ft 7 in occurred at 2 km 12 mi depth and the rupture was concentrated within a 10 km 62 mi 8 km 50 mi area along the fault the primary fault displayed strikeslip displacements while the three secondary structures displayed obliquethrust or strikeslip displacements18 the rupture propagated northeastsouthwest for 15 km 93 mi from the epicenter it produced surface ruptures with a maximum displacement of 784 cm 309 in19 a maximum modified mercalli intensity of viii severe was estimated by the usgs according to the usgs prompt assessment of global earthquakes for response service there was a 35 percent probability of shakingrelated fatalities between 100 and 100020 the service also stated that the disaster was potentially widespread approximately 13000 people were within the zone of intensity viii and 30000 people were exposed to vii very strong shaking20 intensity vii shaking was felt in paktikas gayan district while intensity vvi moderatestrong was felt in barmal district20 an evaluation of damaged homesof the clay brick typeand seismic effects reported by villagers indicate a maximum modified mercalli intensity of viiiix severeviolent around the rupture area21 one hour after the mainshock a mb 45 aftershock occurred 6 km 37 mi south of the mainshock epicenter22 another aftershock measuring mb 42 was recorded on 24 june23 it killed five people and wounded 11 more in paktika afghanistan24 the strongest aftershock occurred on 18 july measuring mww

destroying several homes in ster giyan31 on 23 august a magnitude 46 aftershock caused several houses previously damaged by the mainshock in gayan district to collapse3231 bakhtar news agency said there were at least 1150 deaths and 1600 wounded33 the united nations un cited a death toll of 1039 and 2949 people injured34 among the casualties were 230 dead and 591 injured children35 it is the deadliest earthquake in afghanistan since 2002 when over 1200 people were killed in baghlan province3637 about 10000 homes were partially or totally destroyed5 poor construction practices and building materials contributed to the high death toll37 seismologist lucy jones said the destruction was attributed to the shallow earthquake focus and epicenter in a densely populated landsliderisk area where buildings made of wood and mud are not earthquakeresistant38939 weeks of heavy rain prior to the earthquake had also weakened the structural integrity of homes40 many houses constructed primarily of wood and mud were razed to the ground41 heavy rain and the earthquake also contributed to landslides that added to the destruction42 more than 25 villages were almost decimated schools hospitals homes
