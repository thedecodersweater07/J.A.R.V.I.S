the black september organization bso arabic romanized munaamat ayll alaswad was a palestinian militant organization which was founded in september 19701 besides other actions the group was responsible for the assassination of the jordanian prime minister wasfi tal and the munich massacre in which eleven israeli athletes and officials were kidnapped and killed as well as a west german policeman dying during the 1972 summer olympics in munich their most publicized event these attacks led to the creation or specialization of permanent counterterrorism forces in many european countries the groups name is derived from the black september conflict which began on 16 september 1970 when king hussein of jordan declared military rule in response to fedayeen attempting to seize his kingdom resulting in the deaths and expulsion of thousands of palestinian fighters from jordan the bso began as a small cell of fatah men determined to take revenge upon king hussein and the jordanian armed forces recruits from the pflp assaiqa and other groups also joined initially most of its members were dissidents within fatah who had been close to abu ali iyad the commander of fatah forces in northern jordan who continued to fight the jordanian army after the plo leadership withdrew he was killed allegedly through execution by jordanian forces on 23 july 19712 it was alleged by them that the jordanian prime minister at the time wasfi tal was personally responsible for his torture and death3 there is disagreement among historians journalists and primary sources about the nature of the bso and the extent to which it was controlled by fatah the palestine liberation organization plo faction controlled at the time by yasser arafat in his book stateless salah khalaf abu iyad arafats chief of security and a founding member of fatah wrote that black september was not a terrorist organization but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential the members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and fatah or the plo the denial described in abu iyads claim was mutual according to a 1972 article in the jordanian newspaper addustour mohammed daoud oudeh also known as abu daoud a bso operative and former senior plo member told jordanian police there is no such organization as black september fatah announces its own operations under this name so that fatah will not appear as the direct executor of the operation a march 1973 document released in 1981 by the us state department seemed to confirm that fatah was black septembers parent organization4 according to american journalist john k cooley the bso represented a total break with the old operational and organizational methods of the fedayeen its members operated in airtight cells of four or more men and women each cells members were kept purposely ignorant of other cells leadership was exercised from outside by intermediaries and cutoffs sic though there was no centralized leadership5 cooley writes that many of the cells in europe and around the world were made up of palestinians and other arabs who had lived in their countries of residence as students teachers businessmen and diplomats for many years operating without a central leadership it was a true collegial direction5 the cell structure and the needtoknow operational philosophy protected the operatives by ensuring that the apprehension or surveillance of one cell would not affect the others the structure offered plausible deniability to the fatah leadership which was careful to distance itself from black september operations fatah needed black september according to historian benny morris he writes that there was a problem of internal plo or fatah cohesion with extremists constantly demanding greater militancy the moderates apparently acquiesced in the creation of black september in order to survive6 as a result of pressure from militants writes morris a fatah congress in damascus in augustseptember 1971 agreed to establish black september the new organization was based on fatahs existing special intelligence and security apparatus and on the plo offices and representatives in various european capitals and from very early on there was cooperation between black september and the pflp6 the plo closed black september down in september 1973 on the anniversary it was created by the political calculation that no more good would come of terrorism abroad according to morris7 in 1974 arafat ordered the plo to withdraw from acts of violence outside the west bank the gaza strip and israel the group was responsible for the 1972 munich massacre in which eleven israeli olympic athletes were murdered nine of whom were first taken hostage and the killing of a german police officer during the 1972 summer olympics in munich germany following the attack the israeli government headed by prime minister golda meir launched an assassination campaign and ordered mossad to assassinate those known to have been involved in the munich massacre8 by 1979 at least one mossad unit had assassinated eight black september and plo members including ali hassan salameh nicknamed the red prince the wealthy flamboyant son of an upperclass family and commander of force 17 yasser arafats personal security squad salameh was also behind the 1972 hijacking of sabena flight 572 from vienna to lod he was killed by a car bomb in beirut on 22 january 1979 during a raid in lebanon in april 1973 israeli commandos killed three senior members of black september in beirut in july 1973 in what became known as the lillehammer affair ahmed bouchiki an innocent moroccan waiter who was mistaken for ali hassan salameh was killed in norway six israeli operatives were arrested for the murder remarks in 2010 by abu daoud the alleged mastermind of the munich kidnappings deny that any of the palestinians assassinated by mossad had any relation to the munich operation9 despite the fact that the list includes two of the three surviving members of the kidnap squad arrested at the airport10
