the martin marietta sm68ahgm25a titan i was the united states first multistage intercontinental ballistic missile icbm in use from 1959 until 1962 though the sm68a was operational for only three years it spawned numerous followon models that were a part of the us arsenal and space launch capability the titan i was unique among the titan models in that it used liquid oxygen and rp1 as propellants all subsequent versions used storable propellants instead originally designed as a backup in case the us air forces sm65 atlas missile development ran into problems the titan was ultimately beaten into service by atlas deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the titans missile silo basing was more survivable than atlas the succeeding lgm25c titan ii served in the us nuclear deterrent until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants by january 1955 the size of nuclear weapons had been shrinking dramatically allowing the possibility of building a bomb that could be carried by a missile of reasonable size the titan i program began on the recommendation of the scientific advisory committee1 the committee presented to the united states air force usaf their findings of the technical feasibility to develop weapons bombs and their delivery systems intercontinental range ballistic missiles that were completely invulnerable to surprise attack the reduction in the mass of nuclear warheads allowed full coverage of the entire sinosoviet land mass and the missile control capabilities were also upgraded the titan i would be fully independent in controlled flight from launch to the ballistic release of the warhead which would descend to its target by the combination of gravity and air resistance alone in may 1955 the air materiel command invited contractors to submit proposals and bids for the two stage titan i icbm formally beginning the program in september 1955 the martin company was declared the contractor for the titan missile in early october the air forces western development division was ordered to start work2 the titan was developed in parallel with the atlas sm65hgm16 icbm serving as a backup with potentially greater capabilities and an incentive for the atlas contractor to work harder3 martin was selected as the contractor due to its proposed organization4 and method of igniting a liquid fueled engine at high altitude5 the titan i was initially designated as a bomber aircraft b686 but was later designated sm68 titan and finally hgm25a in 1962 the previous strategic missile programs of the air force had been administered using the single prime contractor concept later called the weapon system concept7 this had resulted in three badly botched programs the programs of the snark navaho and rascal missiles had slipped an average of 5 years and had cost overruns of 300 per cent or more8 in response the teapot committee was tasked with evaluating requirements for ballistic missiles and methods of accelerating their development as a result of the ensuing recommendations the usaf established the western development division and brigadier general bernard schriever was detailed to command it schriever devised an entirely new organization for program management the air force was to act as prime contractor the ramowoolridge corporation was contracted to provide systems engineering and technical direction of all ballistic missiles the airframe contractor also would assemble the subsystems provided by other air force contractors9 at the time this new organization was very controversial10 the titan i represented an evolution of technology when compared to the atlas missile program but shared many of the atlas problems the liquid oxygen oxidizer could not be stored for long periods of time increasing the response time as the missile had to be raised out of its silo and loaded with oxidizer before a launch could occur the main improvements of the titan i over the first atlass deployed were vertical storage in a fully underground silo and an improved fully internal inertial guidance system later atlas ef models were equipped with what would have been the titan is guidance system11 the titan i would be deployed with the bell labs radioinertial guidance system1213 the titan proposed as a fallback in case the atlas failed was by december 1956 accepted by some as a principal ingredient of the national ballistic missile force14 at the same time others pushed for the cancellation of the titan program almost from the beginning arguing that it was redundant15 despite counterarguments that the titan offered greater performance and growth potential than the atlas as a missile and space launch vehicle15 the titan program was under constant budgetary pressure in the summer of 1957 budget cuts led secretary of defense wilson to reduce the titan production rate from the proposed seven per month to two a month which left the titan as a research and development program only16 however the sputnik crisis which started 5 october 1957 ended any talk of canceling titan priority was restored and 1958 saw increases in funding and plans for additional titan squadrons17 the titan i flight testing consisted of the first stage only series i the cancelled series ii and series iii with the complete missile18 a total of 62 flight test missiles were constructed in various numbers the first successful launch was on 5 february 1959 with titan i a3 and the last test flight was on 29 january 1962 with titan i m7 of the missiles produced 49 launched and two exploded six atypes four launched seven btypes two launched six ctypes five launched ten gtypes seven launched 22 jtypes 22 launched four vtypes four launched and seven mtypes seven launched missiles were tested and launched in florida at cape canaveral air force station from launch complexes lc15 lc16 lc19 and lc20191820 the four atype missile launches with dummy second stages all occurred in 1959 and were carried out on 6 february 25 february 3 april and 4 may the guidance system and stage separation all performed well and aerodynamic drag was lower than anticipated titan i was the first program to have a new missile succeed on the initial attempt which left launch crews unprepared for the series of failures that followed missile b4 exploded from a lox pump failure during a static firing at martins denver test stand in may and assorted other mishaps occurred in the following two months21 missile b5 was intended to launch from lc19 as the first flight article lot b missile incorporating most titan i missile systems but with a dummy warhead a planned launch on july 31 was scrubbed due to fuel system problems at about noon on august 5 b5 was launched the missile rose about ten feet before the engines shut down and it fell back onto lc19 in a fiery explosion postflight investigation found that the holddown bolts released prematurely causing b5 to lift before full thrust rise had been achieved a stillattached umbilical sent a shutdown command to the engines lc19 was badly damaged and would not be used again for six months21 further problems occurred over the next several months missiles continued to be damaged through careless personnel mistakes and general osmond ritland sent martin an angry letter calling their handling of the titan program inexcusable ritlands disciplinary blast had little effect for the time being on december 10 the first attempt was made to launch a lot c missile which would be a complete titan i with all systems and a detachable warhead missile c3 was prepared for launch but much like with b5 a premature shutdown command was sent due to failure of an umbilical to detach fortunately the missile had not been released from the pad the umbilical was quickly repaired but any relief at having avoided neardisaster was shortlived at 111 pm est on december 12 missile c3 launched from lc16 the engines started but the missile almost immediately disappeared in a fireball the mishap was quickly traced to the range safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibrationprone area during repair work on the missile and testing confirmed that the shock from the pad holddown bolts firing was enough to set off the relay the pad was not as badly damaged as lc19 had been from the b5 mishap as c3 had not actually lifted and it was repaired in only two months22 on 2 february 1960 lc19 returned to action as missile b7a marked the first successful flight of a titan with a live upper stagethis was a composite missile as b7s original upper stage was damaged months earlier in an accident and it was replaced with the upper stage from missile b6 which had had its first stage damaged in another accident on 5 february lc16 returned to action by hosting missile c4 the second attempt at a lot c titan failed at t52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed causing the rvx3 reentry vehicle to separate22 the missile pitched down and the first stage lox tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads blowing the stage to pieces after the first stage destroyed itself the second stage separated and began engine ignition sensing that normal staging had taken place with no attitude control it began tumbling endoverend and quickly lost thrust the stage plummeted into the atlantic ocean some 3040 miles downrange 23 after the successful flight of missile g4 on 24 february missile c1s second stage failed to ignite on 8 march due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting24 the last lot c missile was c6 which flew successfully on april 28 the lot g missiles incorporated several design improvements to correct problems encountered on previous titan launches on 1 july the newly opened lc20 hosted its first launch when missile j2 an operational prototype was flown unfortunately a broken hydraulic line caused the titans engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared25 the missile pitched over and flew onto a nearhorizontal plane when range safety sent the destruct command at t11 seconds the burning remains of the titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball the piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrievedit had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure the sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose examination of other titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines and the missile j2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing26 the next launch at the end of the month missile j4 suffered premature first stage shutdown and landed far short of its planned impact point cause of the failure was a lox valve closing prematurely which resulted in the rupture of a propellant duct and thrust termination missile j6 on 24 october set a record by flying 6100 miles the j series resulted in minor changes to alleviate the second stage shutting down prematurely or failing to ignite25 the string of failures during 195960 led to complaints from the air force that martinmarietta werent taking the titan project seriously since it was just a backup to the primary atlas icbm program and displayed an indifferent careless attitude that resulted in easily avoidable failure modes such as missile c3s range safety command destruct system relays being placed in a vibrationprone area2227 in december missile v2 was undergoing a flight readiness test in a silo at vandenberg air force base california the plan was to load the missile with propellant raise it up to firing position and then lower it back into the silo unfortunately the silo elevator collapsed causing the titan to fall back down and explode the blast was so violent that it ejected a service tower from inside the silo and launched it some distance into the air before coming back down282930 a total of 21 titan i launches took place during 1961 with five failures on 20 january 1961 missile aj10 launched from lc19 at ccas the flight ended in failure when an improper disconnect of a pad umbilical caused an electrical short in the second stage the titan performed well through the first stage burn but after second stage separation the fuel valve to the gas generator failed to open preventing engine start missiles aj12 and aj15 in march were lost due to turbopump problems missile m1s second stage lost thrust when the hydraulic pump failed missile sm2 experienced early first stage shutdown although the second stage burn was successful it had to run to propellant depletion instead of a timed cutoff the added stress of this operation apparently resulted in a failure of either the gas generator or turbopump as the vernier solo phase ended prematurely missile m6s second stage failed to start when an electrical relay malfunctioned and reset the ignition timer2031 with attention shifting to the titan ii there were only six titan i flights during 1962 with one failure when missile sm4 21 january experienced an electrical short in the second stage hydraulic actuator which gimbaled hard left at t98 seconds staging was performed successfully but the second stage engine failed to start31 twelve more titan is were flown in 196365 with the finale being missile sm33 flown on 5 march 1965 the only total failure in this last stretch of flights was when missile v4 1 may 1963 suffered a stuck gas generator valve and loss of engine thrust at liftoff the titan fell over and exploded on impact with the ground3233 although most of the titan is teething problems were worked out by 1961 the missile was already eclipsed not only by the atlas but by its own design successor the titan ii a bigger more powerful icbm with storable hypergolic propellants the launch pads at cape canaveral were quickly converted for the new vehicle vandenberg launch complex 395 continued to provide for operational test launches the last titan i launch was from lc 395a silo a2 in march 196534 after a brief period as an operational icbm it was retired from service in 1965 when defense secretary robert mcnamara made the decision to phase out all first generation cryogenically fueled missiles in favor of newer hypergolic and solidfueled models while decommissioned atlas and later titan ii missiles were recycled and utilized for space launches the titan i inventory was stored and eventually scrapped35 produced by the glenn l martin company which became the martin company in 1957 titan i was a twostage liquidfueled ballistic missile with an effective range of 6101 nautical miles 11300 km the first stage delivered 300000 pounds 1330 kn of thrust the second stage 80000 pounds 356 kn the fact that titan i like atlas burned rocket propellant 1 rp1 and liquid oxygen lox meant that the oxidizer had to be loaded onto the missile just before launch from an underground storage tank and the missile raised above ground on the enormous elevator system exposing the missile for some time before launch the complexity of the system combined with its relatively slow reaction time fifteen minutes to load followed by the time required to raise and launch the first missile36 following the launch of the first missile the other two could reportedly be fired at 712minute intervals37 titan i utilized radioinertial command guidance the inertial guidance system originally intended for the missile was instead eventually deployed in the atlas e and f missiles38 less than a year later the air force considered deploying the titan i with an allinertial guidance system but that change never occurred39 the atlas series was intended to be the first generation of american icbms and titan ii as opposed to titan i was to be the second generation deployed the titan 1 was controlled by an autopilot which was informed of the missiles attitude by a rate gyro assembly consisting of 3 gyroscopes during the first minute or two of the flight a pitch programmer put the missile on the correct path37 from that point the angrw5 guidance radar tracked a transmitter on the missile the guidance radar fed missile position data to the angsk1 univac athena missile guidance computer in the launch control center4041 the guidance computer used the tracking data to generate instructions which were encoded and transmitted to the missile by the guidance radar guidance inputoutput between the guidance radar and guidance computer occurred 10 times a second42 guidance commands continued for the stage 1 burn the stage 2 burn and the vernier burn ensuring the missile was on the correct trajectory and terminating the vernier burn at the desired velocity the last thing the guidance system did was to determine if the missile was on the right trajectory and prearm the warhead which then separated from the second stage43 in case of the failure of the guidance system at one site the guidance system at another site could be used to guide the missiles of the site with the failure44 titan i also was the first true multistage two or more stages design the atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch two were jettisoned during flight due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability45 martin in part was selected as the contractor because it had recognized the magnitude of the altitude start problem for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it4 titan is secondstage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude after separation from the first stage booster the first stage besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad thrust ring with it when the first stage had finished consuming its propellant it dropped away thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle titan is ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that titan i had a much greater total range and a greater range per pound of secondstage fuel than atlas even if the total fuel load of atlas had been greater46 as north american aviations rocketdyne division was the only manufacturer of large liquid propellent rocket engines the air force western development division decided to develop a second source for them aerojetgeneral was selected to design and manufacture the engines for the titan aerojet produced the lr87aj3 booster and lr91aj3 sustainer george p sutton wrote aerojets most successful set of large lpre was that for the booster and sustainer stages of the versions of the titan vehicle47 the warhead of the titan i was an avco mk 4 reentry vehicle containing a w38 thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 375 megatons which was fuzed for either air burst or contact burst the mk 4 rv also deployed penetration aids in the form of mylar balloons which replicated the radar signature of the mk 4 rv48 first stage second stage the univac athena computer calculated ground commands to transmit to the titan missile as part of western electrics missile guidance system the athena was the first transistorized digital computer to be produced in numbers it consisted of ten cabinets plus console on a 135 by 20 foot 41 by 6 m floor plan it used radar tracking of the missile to compute titan flight data to the necessary burnout point to start a ballistic trajectory toward the target onboard titan attitude control rolled the missile to maintain the missile antenna aligned to the ground antenna computer commands were transmitted to the missile from a ground transmitter a quarter mile out 400 m50 completed in 1957 the athena weighed 21000 pounds 11 short tons 95 t5152 the athena computer used a harvard architecture design with separate data and instruction memories by seymour cray at sperry rand corporation and cost about 180000053 used with the computer were the the battleshort mode meltbeforefail prevented failsafe circuits such as fuses from deactivating the machine eg during a missile launch57 the last athenacontrolled launch was a thoragena missile launched in 1972 from vandenberg air force base in california the last of over 400 missile flights using the athena5859 the production of operational missiles began during the final stages of the flight test program31 an operational specification sm2 missile was launched from vandenberg afb lc395a3 on 21 january 1962 with the m7 missile launched on the last development flight from cape canaverals lc19 on 29 january 196260 there were 59 xsm68 titan is manufactured i in 7 developmental lots one hundred and one sm68 titan i missiles were produced to equip six squadrons of nine missiles each across western america fiftyfour missiles were in silos in total with one missile as a spare on standby at each squadron bringing to 60 in service at any one time61 titan was originally planned for a 1 x 10 one control center with 10 launchers soft site62 in mid1958 it was decided that the american bosh arma allinertial guidance system designed for titan would because production was insufficient be assigned to atlas and the titan would switch to radioinertial guidance63 the decision was made to deploy titan squadrons in a hardened 3 x 3 three sites with one control center and three silos each to reduce the number of guidance systems required radioinertial guided atlas d squadrons were similarly sited64 although titan is two stages gave it true intercontinental range and foreshadowed future multistage rockets its propellants were dangerous and hard to handle cryogenic liquid oxygen oxidizer had to be pumped aboard the missile just before launch and complex equipment was required to store and move this liquid65 in its brief career a total of six usaf squadrons were equipped with the titan i missile each squadron was deployed in a 3x3 configuration which meant each squadron controlled a total of nine missiles divided among three launch sites with the six operational units spread across the western united states in five states colorado with two squadrons both east of denver idaho california washington and south dakota each missile complex had three titan i icbm missiles ready to launch at any given time weapon system 107a2 was a weapon system it encompassed all of the equipment and even the bases for the titan i strategic missile the titan i was first american icbm designed to be based in underground silos and it gave usaf managers contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival the complexes were composed of an entry portal control center powerhouse terminal room two antenna silos for the athena guidance radar antennas and three launchers each composed of three equipment terminals three propellant terminals and three missile silos all connected by an extensive network of tunnels66 both antenna terminals and all three launchers were isolated with double door blast locks the doors of which could not be open at the same time this was to ensure that if there was an explosion in a missile launcher or the site was under attack only the exposed antenna andor missile silo would be damaged67 the launch crew was composed of a missile combat crew commander missile launch officer mlo guidance electronics officer geo ballistic missile analyst technician bmat and two electrical power production technicians eppt68 there were also a cook and two air police69 during normal duty hours there was a site commander site maintenance officer site chief job controllerexpediter tool crib operator power house chief three pad chiefs three assistant pad chiefs another cook and more air police there could be a number of electricians plumbers power production technicians air conditioning technicians and other specialist when maintenance was being performed69 these early complexes while safe from a nearby nuclear detonation however had certain drawbacks first the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel and then one at a time had to be lifted to the surface on elevators for launching and guidance which slowed their reaction time rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles even though titan complexes were designed to withstand nearby nuclear blasts antenna and missile extended for launch and guidance were quite susceptible to even a relatively distant miss70 the missiles sites of a squadron were placed at least 17 usually 20 to 30 miles apart so that a single nuclear weapon could not take out two sites71 the sites also had to be close enough that if a sites guidance system failed it could handover its missiles to another site of the squadron7273 the distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1000 and 1300 feet 400 m these were by far the most complex extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the usaf747576 launching a missile required fueling it in its silo and then raising the launcher and missile out of the silo on an elevator before each launch the guidance radar which was periodically calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing77 had to acquire a radio on the missile missile guidance set andrw18 andrw19 andrw20 andrw21 or andrw227879 when the missile was launched the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the guidance computer which then generated guidance corrections that were transmitted to the missile because of this the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time although another could be elevated while the first was being guided when the storablefueled titan ii and the solidfueled minuteman i were deployed in 1963 the titan i and atlas missiles became obsolete they were retired from service as icbms in early 19658081 the final launch from vandenberg air force base vafb occurred on 5 march 1965 at that time the disposition of the 101 total production missiles was as followscitation needed three at vafb one at each of five bases one at lowry and 20 in storage at sbama elsewhere the 83 surplus missiles remained in inventory at mira loma afs it did not make economic sense to refurbish them as sm65 atlas missiles with similar payload capacities had already been converted to satellite launchers about 33 were distributed to museums parks and schools as static displays see list below the remaining 50 missiles were scrapped at mira loma afs near san bernardino ca the last was broken up in 1972 in accordance with the salti treaty of 1 february 197282 by november 1965 the air force logistics command had determined that the cost of modifying the widely dispersed sites to support other ballistic missiles was prohibitive and attempts were made to find new uses83 by spring 1966 a number of possible uses and users had been identified by 6 may 1966 the air force wanted to retain 5 titan sites and the general services administration had earmarked 1 for possible use the usaf removed equipment it had uses for the rest was offered to other government agencies84 eventually no sites were retained and all were salvaged the chosen method was the service and salvage contract which required the contractor to remove the equipment the government wanted before proceeding with scrapping85 this accounts for the varied degree of salvage at the sites today most are sealed today with one in colorado that is easily entered but also very unsafe86 one is open for tours87 the 26 athena guidance computers when declared surplus by the federal government went to various united states universities the one at carnegie was used as an undergraduate project until 1971 when the former electrical engineering undergraduate students athena systems development group orchestrated its donation to the smithsonian institution one remained in use at vandenberg afb until it guided a last thoragena launch in may 1972 it had guided over 400 missiles8889 on 6 september 1985 strategic defense initiative aka star wars program a scrapped titan i second stage was used in a missile defense test the miracl near infrared laser at white sands missile range nm was fired at a stationary titan i second stage that was fixed to the ground the second stage burst and was destroyed by the laser blast the second stage was pressurized with nitrogen gas to 60psi and did not contain any fuel or oxidizer a followup test 6 days later was conducted on a scrapped thor irbm its remnants reside at the slc10 museum at vandenberg afb90 of the 33 titan i strategic missiles and two plus five possible research and development missiles that were not launched destroyed or scrapped several survive todaycitation needed note two stacked titan1 first stages created a perfect illusion of a titan2 missile for museums above the titan i was considered for use as the first missile to put a man in space two of the firms responding to an air force request for proposal for project 7969 an early usaf project to put a man in space soonest miss two of the four firms which responded martin and avco proposed using titan i as the booster9192
