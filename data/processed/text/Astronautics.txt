astronautics or cosmonautics is the practice of sending spacecraft beyond earths atmosphere into outer space spaceflight is one of its main applications and space science is its overarching field the term astronautics originally astronautique in french was coined in the 1920s by jh rosny president of the goncourt academy in analogy with aeronautics1 because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once in 1930 robert esnaultpelterie published the first book on the new research field2 the term cosmonautics originally cosmonautique in french was introduced in the 1930s by ary sternfeld with his book initiation la cosmonautique introduction to cosmonautics3 the book brought him the prix rephirsch later known as the prix dastronautique of the french astronomical society in 19344 as with aeronautics the restrictions of mass temperatures and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions highgrade vacuum the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the magnetic belts of low earth orbit space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces while satellites can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods5 extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual payload that reaches orbit the early history of astronautics is theoretical the fundamental mathematics of space travel was established by isaac newton in his 1687 treatise philosophi naturalis principia mathematica6 other mathematicians such as swiss leonhard euler and francoitalian joseph louis lagrange also made essential contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries in spite of this astronautics did not become a practical discipline until the mid20th century on the other hand the question of spaceflight puzzled the literary imaginations of such figures as jules verne and h g wells at the beginning of the 20th century russian cosmist konstantin tsiolkovsky derived the rocket equation the governing equation for a rocketbased propulsion enabling computation of the final velocity of a rocket from the mass of spacecraft m 1 displaystyle m1 combined mass of propellant and spacecraft m 0 displaystyle m0 and exhaust velocity of the propellant v e displaystyle ve by the early 1920s robert h goddard was developing liquidpropellant rockets which would in a few brief decades become a critical component in the designs of such famous rockets as the v2 and saturn v the prix dastronautique astronautics prize awarded by the socit astronomique de france the french astronomical society was the first prize on this subject the international award established by aviation and astronautical pioneer robert esnaultpelterie and andrlouis hirsch was given from 1929 to 1939 in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics by the mid1950s the space race between the ussr and the us had begun although many regard astronautics itself as a rather specialized subject engineers and scientists working in this area must be knowledgeable in many distinct fields
