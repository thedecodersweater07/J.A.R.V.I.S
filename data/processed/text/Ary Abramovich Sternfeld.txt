ary sternfeld 14 may 1905 5 july 1980 was cocreator of the modern aerospace science he was a polish engineer of jewish origin who studied in poland and france from 1935 until his death he worked in moscow he was the first person to describe the bielliptic transfer technique of changing orbits in 19341 in 1934 sternfeld won the prix rephirsch later known as the prix dastronautique of the french astronomical society for his book initiation la cosmonautique2 he is thus credited with introducing the word cosmonautics in the language of science and engineering3 ary abramovich sternfeld was born 14 may 1905 in the city of sieradz in poland then in kalisz governorate of russian empire near d into a merchant family he had three sisters from a young age he displayed wonderful memory a good imagination and a sharp mind he was still a child when he considered a trip to the moon when he saw the moon return to a crescent at the start of the month and prayed with his father that the moon would remain unobtainable to enemies but wondered why it was unobtainable he considered flying through space the implementation of his dream the day would come when flying through space would go from a fantasy to realitygave him life when world war one broke out the family moved to d here ary attended a jewish gymnasium in school his first ideas about implementing spaceflight appeared it was advisable to use a rocket with fuel onboard he later had another idea to send a rocket from the sun using the heat at 17 he read in german einsteins monograph about relativity he did not understand a lot of it he decided to write to einstein with his questions afterwards he developed his theories on cosmonautics after graduating from the gymnasium ari entered the school of philosophy at jagiellonian university in krakow he finished the curriculum in spring 1924 he left for france in order to have the means to study not just natural science but also engineering he enrolled in cole nationale suprieure dlectricit et de mcanique ensem in nancy he struggled during the first year he needed to earn a living and support his impoverished parents for several months until the school year started he worked all day starting in the famous parisian market the belly of paris later in the day in the factory reno and he did not have the means to learn french so he worked among immigrants thus when school started he did not understand french the language of the lectures he lived in poverty when the money from summer work was not enough he worked early in the morning controlling gas counters despite the daily struggle he was cheerful sociable curious and successfully entered his second year in the summer he worked for the car company omer samyn in paris and when classes resumed he resumed his old job during this time he continued to consider flying in space this was not an abstract dream but concrete calculations that he implemented he later wrote my colleagues the dreams and schemes that i plotted between lectures seemed to me incurable fantasiesin those days to fly across the atlantic ocean became a sensation and here to possess the power to control the universe after three years of selfless labour and tireless study he became an engineer as an engineer sternfeld returned to paris he worked as a technologist designer and consultant for various technological enterprises he obtained a few patents in the apartment where he lived they jokingly nicknamed him banker students and new engineers take a long time and sternfeld already needing testing needed to return he began to settle down so that he could focus on his favourite work the comprehensive study of spaceflight in 1928 sternfeld studied for a doctorate in sorbonne in order to work on a dissertation about spaceflight he went to the central research institute in paris in order to collect research for his dissertation only to find that the studies he was looking for existed nowhere according to the people there of whom he asked for help many times he conducted research in the national library of france there he collected materials on the history and technology of rocketry questions about flight mechanics and calculated the trajectories of machines in space in 1931 when all was said and done for sternfelds dissertation his advisor stated that he would not be responsible for a research topic so far removed from reality the advisor requested that he change the topic for an elevated stipend but no earthly good could stop sternfeld from perusing his childhood dream he decided to continue the thesis at his own risk during this time he met his future wife gustava erlich like ary gustava came from d in 1924 she was an active and captivating person she had been chosen to work as a secretary for the polish department of a french company and was an esperantist in sorbonne she was working on two degrees in child development and teaching french to foreigners she ultimately edited his scientific work in french russian polish german and yiddish while working on his dissertation sternfeld found out about tsiolkovskys work in 1929 in the german rocketry journal die raket in this time sternfeld did not know russian and tsiolkovsky only worked in russian so he studied russian the first book that he read in russian was tsiolkovskys plan of space exploration it was impossible to get tsiolkovskys work in paris since no library in france had it 11 june 1930 sternfeld wrote a letter to tsiolkovsky with a request to send his work they wrote letters to each other in friendship until tsiolkovsky died 19 august 1930 the french magazine lhumanit published sternfelds article from yesterdays utopia to todays reality in this article he wrote about tsiolkovskys priorities and put in a picture that tsiolkovsky had given him for the article in the next few years sternfeld mentioned tsiolkovsky in his publications the book that tsiolkovsky sent him ended up in paris national library in order to continue his research sternfeld returned to his parents in d in 1932 he worked in a dim room it was necessary to do a lot of calculations he did not have electronics as he did in paris still he wrote many scientific papers he wrote in french the monograph introduction to cosmonautics initiation la cosmonautique the word cosmonautics had previously not existed in neither french nor russian he introduced this as a combination of the terms astronautics and star navigation here he stated the combined problems of communication and conquest of space he worked on many problems this was the first systematic summary of the population of the problems in communication with the upcoming conquest of space from the building of the solar system to the relativistic effects on spaceflight he reported the investigation back to warsaw university 6 december 1933 however spaceflight continued to seem like fantasy once again sternfeld returned to paris there he continued research on 22 january 1934 sternfeld was accepted into the french academy of science during this time he received articles from herman oberth and walter hohmann he worked with the french cosmonauticist robert esnaultpelterie in 1932 sternfeld moved to moscow to work on an android here he made copies of his introduction to cosmonautics starting in 1935 he worked for the institute of reactive scientific research there he worked with korolyov along with other young talented engineers glushko tikhonravov pobedonostsev the chief engineer was langemak a rocketry pioneer who went on to design the katyusha rocket he translated introduction to cosmonautics into russian by the end of the 1930s the government had repressed many of the workers at institute sternfeld was not repressed but he was dismissed in 1937 over the next few years he worked in cosmonautics for the ussr academy of sciences in the beginning years of world war two the sternfelds two daughters were born in june 1941 sternfeld wrote a letter of request to join the red army but they denied his request instead the family went to the city of serov in the urals sternfeld taught physics material science design and machinery there while gustava taught german after the war sternfeld continued to write about cosmonautics into the space era he died in moscow russia
