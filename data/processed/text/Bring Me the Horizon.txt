the red chord across the united kingdom8 as with other early tours they were able to get this slot by tricking venue promoters kean and olivers mother carol sykes were the de facto managers of the band at this time a role they continued to occupy until 20088 for the red chord support kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening on all the dates when they were supposed to play only at their local show this led them to being booked for the whole tour in another case sykes created an email account in the name of johnny truant vocalist oliver mitchell which he used to contact a promoter requesting bring me the horizon on their tour8 alcohol consumption fuelled their live performances in their early history when the band would get so drunk they vomited on stage and damaged their equipment8 the band released their debut album count your blessings in october 2006 in the united kingdom14 and in august 2007 in the united states15 they rented a house in the country to write

guitarist curtis ward left the band28 his relationship with the band had deteriorated as his stage performances were poor he was abusive to audiences during the taste of chaos tour16 and had

that got him to metal was alive or just breathing by killswitch engage180 jordan fish said that the albums that influenced him most were linkin parks hybrid theory and deftones white pony187 the bands

your dads old nissan sunny17 metal hammer described suicide season as a creative critical and commercial success for the band182 as they started to adopt a more eclectic style228 with its crushingly heavy party deathcore7 leading up to its release oliver sykes described it as 100 different to count your blessings and noted the album sounds more rock than metal229 as time went by bring me the horizon began rejecting their debut album count your blessings and considered suicide season as their year zero their wipetheslateclean time230 bring me the horizon then moved even further away from deathcore with their third album there is a hell which incorporated electronica classical music and pop music into their metalcore style231 this required more ambitious production feats such as using a full choir a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns that were also toned down favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks225232 for the writing of sempiternal the band pooled far broader influences such as postrock acts like this will destroy you and explosions in the sky233 and from pop music234 bring me the horizon has experimented with its music in recent years mixing pop with metal music235236237 leading the band to be labelled a pop metal act218 with the release of thats the spirit their sound shifted towards alternative rock238239240 alternative

membersas a bandwere credited with writing the music with the exception of count your blessings the band has always written in a secluded location to avoid being distracted232 sykes lyrics have a strong feeling of catharsis for him he mainly draws from personal experience and has described the bands live performances as therapeutic231 in 2006 when asked about the lyrics of count your blessings as they had been criticised for their content solely fixated on heartbreak and other themes that were called shallow and meaningless he responded my lifes never been that bad so ive not got that much to talk about17 band members have described how the debut album was written in innercity areas of birmingham while being pressured to write and record songs to the deadlines given11 this resulted in the band being unimpressed with the final product however for the writing process of suicide season the band realised that they preferred picking areas with less human contact to focus on the music they wrote their second album in the swedish countryside199 during the writing of suicide season former and founding rhythm guitarist curtis ward wrote only two riffs of his rhythm parts of the album mostly relying on lee malia to write all of the guitar sections of the album11 malia has stated that the typical writing process involves sykes writing the main structure of the songs followed by malia writing the main riff from this they would collaborate with each other to structure their work better and then later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song232 the writing dynamic of sempiternal typically featured sykes malia and newly introduced member jordan fish according to sykes writing sempiternal was a completely different processwe worked from a computer laying down ideas and riffsbringing jordan into the mix changed things completely he opened up so many more possibilities257 as they all took a break before writing their fourth album they felt less of a need for an isolated writing environment258 in their early years the band was praised for their business acumen for selling mailorder merchandise and not relying on sales at live shows259 bring me the horizons image has been characterised by the dominating personality of singer and frontman oliver sykes and he has often been seen as the bands poster boy17260 bearing the brunt of the bands controversial reputation7 early on bring me the horizons image was infamously characterised by its members fashion sense and use of skinnyfit jeans tshirts with death metal band logos on the front and coloured hairstraightened hair the bands image fit into what was called scene fashion20259 the effect of their fashion aesthetics showed people in show promoter iain scotts perspective that you dont have to look like a diabolical metalhead to be into metal or play in a metal band20 however their fashion conscious appearance earned them a style over substance label6 many controversies that occurred in their early years greatly affected public perceptions of the band particularly an incident in 2007 at nottinghams rock city venue when a female fan claimed that oliver sykes had urinated on her261 the charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence from cctv footage in the area262 there were several documented examples of violence against the band during their live shows including sykes being pepper sprayed on stage27 and people getting onstage to assault the band263 despite the controversy over their image various journalists have credited the band as being one of the most forwardthinking heavy bands in the uk182 in 2012 just four years after the release of suicide season the album was inducted into rock sounds hall of fame credited as a significant influence on the works of asking alexandria the ghost inside and while she sleeps it was credited as an influence on metalcore contemporaries architects on hollow crown with their incorporation of keyboards and programming and the devil wears pradas dead throne for its more experimental and opiniondividing sound21 in an interview with kerrang guitarist lee malia remarked that the band wanted to go a bit more experimental saying i always think we have been a year ahead of bands who are kind of just seeing whats cool and then copying it264 the band caused further controversy in february 2016 when oliver sykes trashed coldplays table at the 2016 nme awards during a live performance of bring me the horizons track happy song265 sykes later stated that the act was not an act of dirty protest and suggested that it was pure coincidence that coldplay were sitting at the table he trampled265 coldplay frontman chris martin admitted that he had never even heard of bring me the horizon before the incident and he laughed it off stating that it was great very rock and roll266 another controversy occurred on april 20 2024 when they posted a promotional ad for the brisbane show in australia which read if jesus christ returns well just kill that fucker 2x and caused some backlash among fans267 current touring former timeline studio albums grammy awards brit awards nme awards kerrang awards aim
