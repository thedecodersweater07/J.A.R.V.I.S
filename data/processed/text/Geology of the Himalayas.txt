the geology of the himalayas is one of the most dramatic and visible creations of the immense mountain range formed by plate tectonic forces and sculpted by weathering and erosion the himalayas which stretch over 2400 km between the namcha barwa syntaxis at the eastern end of the mountain range and the nanga parbat syntaxis at the western end are the result of an ongoing orogeny the collision of the continental crust of two tectonic plates the indian plate thrusting into the eurasian plate the himalayatibet region supplies fresh water for more than onefifth of the world population and accounts for a quarter of the global sedimentary budget topographically the belt has many superlatives the highest rate of uplift nearly 10 mmyear at nanga parbat the highest relief 8848 m at mt everest chomolangma among the highest erosion rates at 212 mmyr4 the source of some of the greatest rivers and the highest concentration of glaciers outside of the polar regions from south to north the himalaya himalaya orogen is divided into 4 parallel tectonostratigraphic zones and 5 thrust faults which extend across the length of himalaya orogen each zone flanked by the thrust faults on its north and south has stratigraphy type of rocks and their layering different from the adjacent zones from south to north the zones and the major faults separating them are the main frontal thrust mft subhimalaya zone also called sivalik main boundary thrust mbt lesser himalaya further subdivided into the lesser himalayan sedimentary zone lhsz and the lesser himalayan crystalline nappes lhcn main central thrust mct higher or greater himalayan crystallines hhc south tibetan detachment system std tethys himalaya th and the industsangpo suture zone isz5 north of this lies the transhimalaya in tibet which is outside the himalayas the himalayas border the indogangetic plain to the south pamir mountains to the west in central asia and the hengduan mountains to the east on the chinamyanmar border from east to west the himalayas are divided into 3 regions eastern himalaya central himalaya and western himalaya which collectively house several nations during late precambrian and the palaeozoic the indian subcontinent bounded to the north by the cimmerian superterranes was part of gondwana and was separated from eurasia by the paleotethys ocean fig 1 during that period the northern part of india was affected by a late phase of the panafrican orogeny which is marked by an unconformity between ordovician continental conglomerates and the underlying cambrian marine sediments numerous granitic intrusions dated at around 500 ma are also attributed to this event in the early carboniferous an early stage of rifting developed between the indian subcontinent and the cimmerian superterranes during the early permian this rift developed into the neotethys ocean fig 2 from that time on the cimmerian superterranes drifted away from gondwana towards the north nowadays iran afghanistan and tibet are partly made up of these terranes in the norian 210 ma a major rifting episode split gondwana in two parts the indian continent became part of east gondwana together with australia and antarctica however the separation of east and west gondwana together with the formation of oceanic crust occurred later in the callovian 160155 ma the indian plate then broke off from australia and antarctica in the early cretaceous 130125 ma with the opening of the south indian ocean fig 3 in the late cretaceous 84 ma the indian plate began its very rapid northward drift covering a distance of about 6000 km6 with the oceanicoceanic subduction continuing until the final closure of the oceanic basin and the obduction of oceanic ophiolite onto india and the beginning of continentcontinent tectonic interaction starting at about 65 ma in the central himalaya7 the change of the relative speed between the indian and asian plates from very fast 18195 cmyr to fast 45 cmyr at about 55 ma8 is circumstantial support for collision then since then there has been about 2500 km9101112 of crustal shortening and rotating of india by 45 counterclockwise in the northwestern himalaya13 to 1015 counterclockwise in north central nepal14 relative to asia fig 4 while most of the oceanic crust was simply subducted below the tibetan block during the northward motion of india at least three major mechanisms have been put forward either separately or jointly to explain what happened since collision to the 2500 km of missing continental crust even though it is more than reasonable to argue that this huge amount of crustal shortening most probably results from a combination of these three mechanisms it is nevertheless the last mechanism which created the high topographic relief of the himalaya the himalayan tectonics result in long term deformation this includes shortening across the himalayas that range from 900 to 1500 km said shortening is a product of the significant ongoing seismic activity the continued convergence of the indian plate with the eurasian plate results in mega earthquakes these seismic events can reach greater than mw 8 and result in intense damage to infrastructure the midcrustal ramp in the himalayas is a key geologic feature in the history for both longterm and shortterm seismic processes linked to deformation and shortening over the last 15 ma the ramp has gradually moved south due to duplexing accretion and tectonic undercutting16 the ongoing active collision of the indian and eurasian continental plates challenges one hypothesis for plate motion which relies on subduction one of the most striking aspects of the himalayan orogen is the lateral continuity of its major tectonic elements the himalaya is classically divided into four tectonic units that can be followed for more than 2400 km along the belt fig 5 and fig 7c the subhimalayan tectonic plate is sometimes referred to as the cishimalayan tectonic plate in the older literature it forms the southern foothills of the himalayan range and is essentially composed of miocene to pleistocene molassic sediments derived from the erosion of the himalaya these molasse deposits known as the murree and sivaliks formations are internally folded and imbricated the subhimalayan range is thrust along the main frontal thrust over the quaternary alluvium deposited by the rivers coming from the himalaya ganges indus brahmaputra and others which demonstrates that the himalaya is still a very active orogen the lesser himalaya lh tectonic plate is mainly formed by upper proterozoic to lower cambrian detrital sediments from the passive indian margin intercalated with some granites and acid volcanics 1840 70 ma17 these sediments are thrust over the subhimalayan range along the main boundary thrust mbt the lesser himalaya often appears in tectonic windows kishtwar or larjikulurampur windows within the high himalaya crystalline sequence the central himalayan domain forms the backbone of the himalayan orogen and encompasses the areas with the highest topographic relief highest peaks it is commonly separated into four zones approximately 30 different names exist in the literature to describe this unit the most frequently found equivalents are greater himalayan sequence tibetan slab and high himalayan crystalline it is a 30kmthick medium to highgrade metamorphic sequence of metasedimentary rocks which are intruded in many places by granites of ordovician c 500 ma and early miocene c 22 ma age although most of the metasediments forming the hhcs are of late proterozoic to early cambrian age much younger metasediments can also be found in several areas eg mesozoic in the tandi syncline of nepal and warwan valley of kistwar in kashmir permian in the tschuldo slice ordovician to carboniferous in the sarchu area on lehmanali highway it is now generally accepted that the metasediments of the hhcs represent the metamorphic equivalents of the sedimentary series forming the base of the overlying tethys himalaya the hhcs forms a major nappe which is thrust over the lesser himalaya along the main central thrust mct the tethys himalaya is an approximately 100kmwide synclinorium formed by strongly folded and imbricated weakly metamorphosed sedimentary series several nappes termed the north himalayan nappes18 have also been described within this unit an almost complete stratigraphic record ranging from the upper proterozoic to the eocene is preserved within the sediments of the th stratigraphic analysis of these sediments yields important indications on the geological history of the northern continental margin of the indian subcontinent from its gondwanian evolution to its continental collision with eurasia the transition between the generally lowgrade sediments of the tethys himalaya and the underlying low to highgrade rocks of the high himalayan crystalline sequence is usually progressive but in many places along the himalayan belt this transition zone is marked by a major structure the central himalayan detachment system also known as the south tibetan detachment system or north himalayan normal fault which has indicators of both extension and compression see ongoing geologic studies section below nyimalingtso morari metamorphic dome in the ladakh region the tethys himalaya synclinorium passes gradually to the north in a large dome of greenschist to eclogitic metamorphic rocks as with the hhcs these metamorphic rocks represent the metamorphic equivalent of the sediments forming the base of the tethys himalaya the precambrian phe formation is also here intruded by several ordovician c 480 ma19 granites the lamayuru and markha units are formed by flyschs and olistholiths deposited in a turbiditic environment on the northern part of the indian continental slope and in the adjoining neotethys basin the age of these sediments ranges from late permian to eocene the metamorphic rocks of the himalaya can be very useful in deciphering and coming up with models of tectonic relationships according to kohn 2014 the exhumation of metamorphic rocks can be explained by the main himalayan thrust20 although the mechanism of emplacing higher grade metamorphic rocks on top of lower grade metamorphic rocks still strongly debated kohn believes that it is due to long periods of transportation of higher grade metamorphic rocks on the main himalayan thrust essentially the longer the higher grade rocks were spatially interacting with the thrust the farther they were transported the exhumation of eclogite and granulite rocks can be explained by several different models the first model includes slab tear where the lower plate tore off into the mantle leading to high amounts of rebound the second model states that the rocks got to a certain point in subduction and then were forced back up through the channel they came down due to a space problem the third model states that the thick continental crust of india further exacerbated the space problem and caused the corner flow of those rocks back up the channel the fourth model includes the rocks being transported along the main himalayan thrust research on the kumaon section of the himalayas in 2011 showed the higher himalayan crystalline hhc metamorphic series recorded at least four major stages of metamorphism a preindianasian collision stage two differentlyoriented stages during collision and one of extension using apatite and zircon fissiontrack analysis the researchers were also able to show that the ages of their samples did not change as one moved further north into the complex from the main central thrust even though samples were taken at different elevations this implies a steadystate exhumation system where isotherms are parallel so the distance rock travels as it is pushed upwards is uniform and thus so is the speed of exhumation the rate of erosion with respect to exhumation is thus also balanced21 isz also called indusyarlung suture zone yarlungzangpo suture zone or yarlungtsangpo suture zone defines the zone of collision between the indian plate and the ladakh batholith also transhimalaya or karakoramlhasa block to the north this suture zone is formed by the modern day rate of convergence between the indian and eurasian plates is measured to be approximately 17 mmyr22 this convergence is accommodated through seismic activity in active fault zones as a result the himalayan range is one of the most seismically active regions in the world this region has experienced many high magnitude earthquakes in the last 100 years including the 1905 kangra earthquake 1975 kinnaur earthquake 1991 uttarkashi earthquake and the 1999 chamoli earthquake all of which were recorded at magnitudes equal or greater than mw 66 a recent study parija et al 2021 sought to quantify the coulomb stress transfer in the western himalayas coulomb stress transfer is used to quantify how earthquakes release stress identifying areas that are put under increased stress and those that have been unloaded this study and those like it are important in understanding the current state of fault zones in the region as well as their potential for rupture in the future22 localized geology and geomorphology topics for various parts of the himalaya are discussed on other pages
