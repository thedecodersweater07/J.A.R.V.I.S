for the third time from 1923 to 1926 sun yatsen and the kuomintang kmt used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in china by conquering the warlords in the north although sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city with the leadership of chiang kaishek the kmt developed its own military power to serve its ambition the canton years saw the evolution of the kmt into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment setting the tone of the kmt rule of china beyond 1927 in 1924 the kmt made the momentous decision to ally with the communist party and the ussr with soviet help kmt reorganized itself along the leninist line and adopted a prolabor and propeasant stance the kmtccp cooperation was confirmed in the 1st national congress of the kmt and the communists were instructed to join the kmt the allied government set up the peasant movement training institute in the city of which mao zedong was a

in august the fledgling army suppressed the canton merchants corps uprising the next year the antiimperialist may thirtieth movement swept the country and the kmt government called for strikes in canton and hong kong the tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the shakee massacre after the death of sun yatsen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists in august the leftwing kmt leader liao zhongkai was assassinated and the rightwing leader hu hanmin the suspected mastermind was exiled to the soviet union leaving the procommunist wang jingwei in charge opposing communist encroachment the rightwing western hills group vowed to expel the communists from the kmt the canton coup on march 20 1926 saw chiang solidify his control over the nationalists and their army against wang jingwei the partys left wing its communist allies and its soviet advisors109110 by may he had ended civilian control of the military110 and begun his northern expedition against the warlords of the north its success led to the split of the kmt between wuhan and nanking and the purge of the communists in the april 12 incident immediately afterwards canton joined the purge under the auspice of li jishen resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing kmt apparatuses and labor groups later in 1927 when zhang fakui a general supportive of the wuhan faction seized canton and installed wang jingweis faction in the city the communists saw an opening and launched the guangzhou uprising prominent communist military leaders ye ting and ye jianying led the failed defense of the city soon control of the city reverted to li jishen li jishen was deposed during a war between chiang and the new guangxi clique by 1929 chen jitang had established himself as the powerholder of guangdong in 1931 he threw his weight behind the antichiang schism by hosting a separate nationalist government in guangzhou111 the opposition to chiang included kmt leaders like wang jingwei sun fo and others from diverse factions the peace negotiations amid the armed standoff led to the 4th national congress of kuomintang being held separately by three factions in nanjing shanghai and canton resigning all his posts chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions while the intraparty division was resolved chen kept his power
