english is a west germanic language that emerged in early medieval england and has since become a global lingua franca456 the namesake of the language is the angles one of the germanic peoples that migrated to britain after its roman occupiers left english is the most spoken language in the world primarily due to the global influences of the former british empire succeeded by the commonwealth of nations and the united states it is the most widely learned second language in the world with more secondlanguage speakers than native speakers however english is only the thirdmost spoken native language after mandarin chinese and spanish3 english is either the official language or one of the official languages in 57 sovereign states and 30 dependent territories making it the most geographically widespread language in the world in the united kingdom the united states australia and new zealand it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law7 it is a coofficial language of the united nations the european union and many other international and regional organisations it has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy science technology international trade logistics tourism aviation entertainment and the internet8 ethnologue estimated that there were over 14 billion speakers worldwide as of 2021update3 old english emerged from a group of west germanic dialects spoken by the anglosaxons late old english borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from old norse a north germanic language91011 then middle english borrowed vocabulary extensively from french dialects which are the source of approximately 28 percent of modern english words and from latin which is the source of an additional 28 percent12 while latin and the romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole english grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the germanic languages and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains germanic in origin english exists on a dialect continuum with scots it is nextmost closely related to low saxon and frisian english is a member of the indoeuropean language family belonging to the west germanic branch of germanic languages13 owing to their descent from a shared ancestor language known as protogermanic english and other germanic languages which include dutch german and swedish14 have characteristic features in common including a division of verbs into strong and weak classes the use of modal verbs and sound changes affecting protoindoeuropean consonants known as grimms and verners laws15 old english was one of several ingvaeonic languages which emerged from a dialect continuum spoken by west germanic peoples during the 5th century in frisia on the coast of the north sea old english emerged among the ingvaeonic speakers on the british isles following their migration there while the other ingvaeonic languages frisian and old low german developed in parallel on the continent16 old english evolved into middle english which in turn evolved into modern english17 particular dialects of old and middle english also developed into other anglic languages including scots18 and the extinct fingallian and yola dialects of ireland19 english was isolated from other germanic languages on the continent and diverged considerably in vocabulary syntax and phonology as a result it is not mutually intelligible with any continental germanic language though some such as dutch and frisian show strong affinities with it especially in its earlier stages20page needed english and frisian were traditionally considered more closely related to one another than they were to other west germanic languages but most modern scholarship does not recognise a particular affinity between them21 though they exhibited similar sound changes not otherwise found around the north sea at that time the specific changes appeared in english and frisian at different times a pattern uncharacteristic for languages sharing a unique phylogenetic ancestor2223 old english also called anglosaxon was the earliest form of the english language spoken from c 450 to c 1150 old english developed from a set of west germanic dialects sometimes identified as anglofrisian or north sea germanic that were originally spoken along the coasts of frisia lower saxony and southern jutland by germanic peoples known to the historical record as the angles saxons and jutes25 from the 5th century the anglosaxons settled britain as the roman economy and administration collapsed by the 7th century old english had become dominant in britain replacing the common brittonic and british latin previously spoken during the roman occupation262728 which ultimately left little influence on english england and english originally nglaland and nglisc are both named after the angles29 old english was divided into two anglian dialects mercian and northumbrian and two saxon dialects kentish and west saxon30 through the influence exerted by the kingdom of wessex and the educational reforms instated by king alfred during the 9th century the west saxon dialect became the standard written variety31 the epic poem beowulf is written in west saxon and the earliest english poem cdmons hymn is written in northumbrian32 modern english developed mainly from mercian but the scots language developed from northumbrian during the earliest period of old english a few short inscriptions were made using a runic alphabet33 by the 6th century a latin alphabet had been adopted written with halfuncial letterforms it included the runic letters wynn and thorn and the modified latin letters eth and ash 3334 old english is a markedly different from modern english such that 21stcentury english speakers are entirely unable to understand old english without special training its grammar was similar to that of modern german nouns adjectives pronouns and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms and word order was much freer than in modern english modern english has case forms in pronouns he him his and has a few verb inflections speak speaks speaking spoke spoken but old english had case endings in nouns as well and verbs had more person and number endings353637 between the 8th and 11th centuries the english spoken in some regions underwent significant changes due to contact with old norse a north germanic language several waves of norsemen colonising the northern british isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put old english speakers in constant contact with old norse norse influence was strongest in the northeastern varieties of old english spoken in the danelaw surrounding york today these features are still particularly present in scots and northern english the centre of norse influence was lindsey located in the midlands after lindsey was incorporated into the anglosaxon polity in 920 english spread extensively throughout the region an element of norse influence that continues in all english varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with th they them their which replaced the anglosaxon pronouns with h hie him hera38 other norse loanwords include give get sky skirt egg and cake typically displacing a native anglosaxon equivalent old norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of old english particularly northern ones39 englischmen eyz hy hadde fram e bygynnyng re manner speche soueron northeron and myddel speche in e myddel of e

from the beginning englishmen had three manners of speaking southern northern and midlands speech in the middle of the country nevertheless through intermingling and mixing first with danes and then with normans amongst many the country language has arisen and some use strange stammering chattering snarling and grating gnashing the middle english period is often defined as beginning with the norman conquest in 1066 during the centuries that followed english was heavily influenced by the form of old french spoken by the new norman ruling class that had migrated to england known as old norman over the following decades of contact members of the middle and upper classes whether native english or norman became increasingly bilingual by 1150 at the latest bilingual speakers represented a majority of the english aristocracy and monolingual french speakers were nearly nonexistent41 the french spoken by the norman elite in england eventually developed into the anglonorman language42 the division between old to middle english can also be placed during the composition of the ormulum c late 12th century a work by the augustinian canon orrm which highlights blending of old english and anglonorman elements in the language for the first time4344 as the lower classes who represented the vast majority of the population remained monolingual english speakers a primary influence of norman was as a lexical superstratum introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics legislation and prestigious social domains11 for instance the french word trne appears for the first time from which the english word throne is derived45 middle english also greatly simplified the inflectional system probably in order to reconcile old norse and old english which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar the distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns the instrumental case was dropped and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession the inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms46 and gradually simplified the system of agreement making word order less flexible47 middle english literature includes geoffrey chaucers canterbury tales c 1400 and thomas malorys le morte darthur 1485 in the middle english period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as chaucer48 in the first translation of the entire bible into english by john wycliffe 1382 matthew 820 reads foxis han dennes and briddis of heuene han nestis49 here the plural suffix n on the verb have is still retained but none of the case endings on the nouns are present the period of early modern english lasting between 1500 and 1700 was characterised by the great vowel shift 13501700 inflectional simplification and linguistic standardisation the great vowel shift affected the stressed long vowels of middle english it was a chain shift meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system mid and open vowels were raised and close vowels were broken into diphthongs for example the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today the great vowel shift explains many irregularities in spelling since english retains many spellings from middle english and it also explains why english vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages5051 english began to rise in prestige relative to norman french during the reign of henry v around 1430 the court of chancery in westminster began using english in its official documents and a new standard form of middle english known as chancery standard developed from the dialects of london and the east midlands in 1476 william caxton introduced the printing press to england and began publishing the first printed books in london expanding the influence of this form of english52 literature in early modern english includes the works of william shakespeare and the 1611 king james version kjv of the bible even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from modern english for example the consonant clusters kn n sw in knight gnat and sword were still pronounced many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of early modern english53 matthew 820 in the kjv reads the foxes have holes and the birds of the ayre have nests54 this exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure replacement with subjectverbobject word order and the use of of instead of the nonpossessive genitive and the introduction of loanwords from french ayre and word replacements bird originally meaning nestling which had replaced old english fugol54 by the late 18th century the british empire had spread english through its colonies and geopolitical dominance commerce science and technology diplomacy art and formal education all contributed to english becoming the first truly global language english also facilitated worldwide international communication554 english was adopted in parts of north america parts of africa oceania and many other regions when they obtained political independence some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using english as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others565758 in the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the united states and its status as a superpower following the second world war has along with worldwide broadcasting in english by the bbc59 and other broadcasters caused the language to spread across the planet much faster6061 in the 21st century english is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been62 as modern english developed explicit norms for standard usage were published and spread through official media such as public education and statesponsored publications in 1755 samuel johnson published his dictionary of the english language which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms in 1828 noah webster published the american dictionary of the english language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing american english that was independent of the british standard within britain nonstandard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes63 in modern english the loss of grammatical case is almost complete it is now found only in pronouns such as he and him she and her who and whom and subjectverbobject word order is mostly fixed63 some changes such as the use of dosupport have become universalised earlier english did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as modern english does at first it was only used in question constructions and even then was not obligatory64 now dosupport with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised the use of progressive forms in ing appears to be spreading to new constructions and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues eg dreamed instead of dreamt and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common eg more polite instead of politer british english is also undergoing change under the influence of american english fuelled by the strong presence of american english in the media656667 as of 2016update 400 million people spoke english as their first language and 11 billion spoke it as a second language69 english is the largest language by number of speakers spoken by communities on every continent70 estimates of second language and foreignlanguage speakers vary greatly depending on how proficiency is defined from 470 million to more than 1 billion7 in 2003 david crystal estimated that nonnative speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of threetoone71 braj kachru has categorised countries into the three circles of english model according to how the language historically spread in each country how it is acquired by the populace and the range of uses it has there with a countrys classification able to change over time7273 innercircle countries have large communities of native english speakers these include the united kingdom the united states australia canada ireland and new zealand where the majority speaks english and south africa where a significant minority speaks english the countries with the most native english speakers are in descending order the united states at least 231 million74 the united kingdom 60 million757677 canada 19 million78 australia at least 17 million79 south africa 48 million80 ireland 42 million and new zealand 37 million81 in these countries children of native speakers learn english from their parents and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn english to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces82 innercircle countries are the base from which english spreads to other regions of the world72 outercircle countries such as the philippines83 jamaica84 india pakistan singapore85 malaysia and nigeria8687 have much smaller proportions of native english speakers but use of english as a second language in education government or domestic business is significant and its use for instruction in schools and official government operations is routine88 these countries have millions of native speakers on dialect continua which range from englishbased creole languages to standard varieties of english used in innercircle countries they have many more speakers who acquire english as they grow up through daytoday use and exposure to englishlanguage broadcasting especially if they attend schools where english is the language of instruction varieties of english learned by nonnative speakers born to englishspeaking parents may be influenced especially in their grammar by the other languages spoken by those learners with most including words rarely used by native speakers in innercircle countries as well as grammatical and phonological differences from innercircle varieties82 expandingcircle countries are where english is taught as a foreign language89 though the character of english as a first second or foreign language in a given country is often debatable and may change over time88 for example in countries like the netherlands an overwhelming majority of the population can speak english90 and it is often used in higher education and to communicate with foreigners91 english is a pluricentric language which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language92939495 spoken english including english used in broadcasting generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation international broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents96 but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written english the norms of standard written english are maintained purely by the consensus of educated english speakers around the world without any oversight by any government or international organisation97 american listeners readily understand most british broadcasting and british listeners readily understand most american broadcasting most english speakers around the world can understand radio programmes television programmes and films from many parts of the englishspeaking world98 both standard and nonstandard varieties of english can include both formal or informal styles distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and nontechnical registers99 the settlement history of the englishspeaking inner circle countries outside britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koin forms of english in south africa australia and new zealand100 the majority of immigrants to the united states without british ancestry rapidly adopted english after arrival now the majority of the united states population are monolingual english speakers74101 modern english is sometimes described as the first global lingua franca60115 or as the first world language116117 english is the worlds most widely used language in newspaper publishing book publishing international telecommunications scientific publishing international trade mass entertainment and diplomacy117 parity with french as a language of diplomacy had been achieved by treaty of versailles negotiations in 1919118 by the time the united nations was founded at the end of world war ii english had become preeminent119 it is one of six official languages of the united nations120 and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations121 many other worldwide international organisations including the international olympic committee specify english as a working language or official language of the organisation many regional international organisations such as the european free trade association efta association of southeast asian nations asean61 and asiapacific economic cooperation apec use english as their sole working language despite most members not being countries with a majority of native english speakers while the eu allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the union in practice english is the main working language of eu organisations122 english serves as the basis for the required controlled natural languages123 seaspeak and airspeak used as international languages of seafaring124 and aviation125 english is the most frequently taught foreign language in the world6061 most people learning english do so for practical reasons as opposed to ideological reasons126 in eu countries english is the most widely spoken foreign language in 19 of the 25 member states where it is not an official language that is the countries other than ireland and malta in a 2012 official eurobarometer poll conducted when the uk was still a member of the eu 38 percent of the eu respondents outside the countries where english is an official language said they could speak english well enough to have a conversation in that language the next most commonly mentioned foreign language french which is the most widely known foreign language in the uk and ireland could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents127 the global influence of english has led to concerns about language death128 and to claims of linguistic imperialism129 and has provoked resistance to the spread of english however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think english provides them with better employment opportunities and increased quality of life130 working knowledge of english has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine131 and computing though it formerly had parity with french and german in scientific research english now dominates the field132 its importance in scientific publishing is such that over 80 percent of scientific journal articles indexed by chemical abstracts in 1998 were written in english as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995133 as decolonisation proceeded throughout the british empire in the 1950s and 1960s former colonies often did not reject english but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies5758134 for example english is one of the official languages of india many indians have shifted from associating the language with colonialism to associating it with economic progress135 english is widely used in media and literature with india being the thirdlargest publisher of englishlanguage books in the world after the us and uk136 however less than 5 percent of the population speak english fluently with the countrys native english speakers numbering in the low hundreds of thousands137138 in 2004 david crystal claimed india had the largest population of people able to speak or understand english in the world139 though most scholars estimate the us remains home to a larger englishspeaking population140 many english speakers in africa have become part of an afrosaxon language community that unites africans from different countries141 regarding its future development it is considered most likely that english will continue to function as a koin language with a standard form that unifies speakers around the world142 english phonology and phonetics differ from one dialect to another usually without interfering with mutual communication phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes speech sounds that distinguish meaning and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes143 this overview mainly describes received pronunciation rp and general american ga the standard varieties of the united kingdom and the united states respectively144145146 most english dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes or 26 if marginal x and glottal stop are included the consonant inventory shown below is valid for california english147 and for rp148 for pairs of obstruents stops affricates and fricatives such as p b t d and s z the first is fortis strong and the second is lenis weak fortis obstruents such as p t s are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants such as b d z and are always voiceless lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances and fully voiced between vowels fortis stops such as p have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects they are aspirated p when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable often unaspirated in other cases and often unreleased p or preglottalised p at the end of a syllable in a singlesyllable word a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened eg nip has a noticeably shorter vowel phonetically not phonemically than nib nb see below149 in rp the lateral approximant l has two main allophones pronunciation variants the clear or plain l as in light and the dark or velarised as in full150 ga has dark l in most cases151 all sonorants liquids l r and nasals m n devoice when following a voiceless obstruent and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word152 the pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speakers accent the accompanying table below lists the vowel phonemes in rp and ga with example words from lexical sets the vowels are represented with symbols from the international phonetic alphabet those given for rp are standard in british dictionaries and other publications153 in rp vowel length is phonemic long vowels are marked with a triangular colon in the table above such as the vowel of need nid as opposed to bid bd154 in ga vowel length is nondistinctive155 in both rp and ga vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable like t t f but not before lenis consonants like d d v or in open syllables thus the vowels of rich rt neat nit and safe sef are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge rd need nid and save sev and the vowel of light lat is shorter than that of lie la because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis156 the vowel only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stemfinal positions157158 some dialects do not contrast and in unstressed positions such that rabbit and abbot rhyme and lenin and lennon are homophonous a dialectal feature called the weak vowel merger159 ga r and r are realised as an rcoloured vowel as in further f phonemically frr which in rp is realised as f phonemically f160 an english syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound syllable onset and coda start and end are optional a syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds as in sprint sprnt and end with up to five as in for some dialects angsts aksts this gives an english syllable a structure of cccvccccc where c represents a consonant and v a vowel the word strengths strks is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in english the consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted as is the order in which they may appear onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters a stop and approximant as in play a voiceless fricative and approximant as in fly or sly s and a voiceless stop as in stay and s a voiceless stop and an approximant as in string161 clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited several consonants have limited distributions h can only occur in syllableinitial position and only in syllablefinal position162 stress plays an important role in english certain syllables are stressed while others are unstressed stress is a combination of duration intensity vowel quality and sometimes changes in pitch stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not163 stress in english is phonemic and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress for instance the word contract is stressed on the first syllable kntrkt kontrakt when used as a noun but on the last syllable kntrkt kntrakt for most meanings for example reduce in size when used as a verb164165166 here stress is connected to vowel reduction in the noun contract the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel but in the verb contract the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases so that a compound word receives a single stress unit but the corresponding phrase has two eg a burnout brnat versus to burn out brn at and a hotdog htd versus a hot dog ht d167 in terms of rhythm english is generally described as a stresstimed language meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal168 stressed syllables are pronounced longer but unstressed syllables syllables between stresses are shortened vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality vowel reduction169 varieties of english vary the most in pronunciation of vowels the bestknown national varieties used as standards for education in nonenglishspeaking countries are british bre and american ame countries such as canada australia ireland new zealand and south africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally170 english has undergone many historical sound changes some of them affecting all varieties and others affecting only a few most standard varieties are affected by the great vowel shift which changed the pronunciation of long vowels but a few dialects have slightly different results in north america a number of chain shifts such as the northern cities vowel shift and canadian shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents171 some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties some conservative varieties like scottish english have a voiceless sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced w in wine but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced w a dialect feature called winewhine merger the voiceless velar fricative sound x is found in scottish english which distinguishes loch lx from lock lk accents like cockney with hdropping lack the glottal fricative h and dialects with thstopping and thfronting like africanamerican vernacular and estuary english do not have the dental fricatives but replace them with dental or alveolar stops t d or labiodental fricatives f v172173 other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yoddropping yodcoalescence and reduction of consonant clusters174page needed ga and rp vary in their pronunciation of historical r after a vowel at the end of a syllable in the syllable coda ga is a rhotic dialect meaning that it pronounces r at the end of a syllable but rp is nonrhotic meaning that it loses r in that position english dialects are classified as rhotic or nonrhotic depending on whether they elide r like rp or keep it like ga175 there is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels these four vowels are only distinguished in rp australia new zealand and south africa in ga these vowels merge to three 176 and in canadian english they merge to two 177 typical for an indoeuropean language english grammar follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment unlike other indoeuropean languages english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class english distinguishes at least seven major word classes verbs nouns adjectives adverbs determiners including articles prepositions and conjunctions some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators and add the class of interjections178 english also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs such as have and do expressing the categories of mood and aspect questions are marked by dosupport whmovement fronting of question words beginning with wh and word order inversion with some verbs179 some traits typical of germanic languages persist in english such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut ie changing the vowel of the stem as in the pairs speak spoke and foot feet and weak stems inflected through affixation such as love loved hand hands180 vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system he him who whom similarly traces of more complex verb conjugation are seen in the inflection of the copula verb to be180 the seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence181 english nouns are only inflected for number and possession new nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding they are semantically divided into proper nouns names and common nouns common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns182 most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix s but a few nouns have irregular plural forms mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier eg one loaf of bread two loaves of bread183 regular plural formation irregular plural formation possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic s also traditionally called a genitive suffix or by the preposition of historically the s possessive has been used for animate nouns whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns today this distinction is less clear and many speakers use s also with inanimates orthographically the possessive s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe if the noun is plural formed with s the apostrophe follows the s179 possessive constructions nouns can form noun phrases nps where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners quantifiers conjunctions or adjectives184 noun phrases can be short such as the man composed only of a determiner and a noun they can also include modifiers such as adjectives eg red tall all and specifiers such as determiners eg the that but they can also tie together several nouns into a single long np using conjunctions such as and or prepositions such as with eg the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles this np uses conjunctions prepositions specifiers and modifiers regardless of length an np functions as a syntactic unit179 for example the possessive enclitic can in cases which do not lead to ambiguity follow the entire noun phrase as in the president of indias wife where the enclitic follows india and not president the class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one a definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known quantifiers which include one many some and all are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number the noun must agree with the number of the determiner eg one man sg but all men pl determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase185 english adjectives are words such as good big interesting and canadian that most typically modify nouns denoting characteristics of their referents eg a red car as modifiers they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners186 english adjectives also function as predicative complements eg the child is happy187 in modern english adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify as in most other indoeuropean languages for example in the phrases the slender boy and many slender girls the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun188 some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison with the positive degree unmarked the suffix er marking the comparative and est marking the superlative a small boy the boy is smaller than the girl that boy is the smallest some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms such as good better and best other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions with the adverb more marking the comparative and most marking the superlative happier or more happy the happiest or most happy189 there is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form190 english determiners are words such as the each many some and which occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite191 they often agree with the noun in number they do not typically inflect for degree of comparison english pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection the personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons ime hehim sheher weus theythem as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular distinguishing between feminine sheher epicene theythem and masculine hehim192193 the subjective case corresponds to the old english nominative case and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case for a patient or direct object of a transitive verb and of the old english dative case for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb194195 the subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause otherwise the objective is used196 while grammarians such as henry sweet197 and otto jespersen198 noted that the english cases did not correspond to the traditional latinbased system some contemporary grammars including the cambridge grammar of the english language retain traditional nominative and accusative labels for the cases199 possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun as in my chair while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun eg the chair is mine200 grammatical person in english no longer distinguishes between formal and informal pronouns of address with the second person singular familiar pronoun thou that previously existed in the language having fallen almost entirely out of use by the 18th century201 both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically a deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation for example the pronoun i identifies the speaker and the pronoun you the addressee anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience for example in the sentence i already told you that the reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase eg he sent it to himself or she braced herself for impact204 prepositional phrases pp are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns eg with the dog for my friend to school in england205 english prepositions have a wide range of uses including describing movement place and other relations between entities as well as functions that are syntactic in nature like introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs205 for example in the phrase i gave it to him the preposition to marks the indirect object of the verb to give traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form with her to me for us but some contemporary grammars no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases206 english verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with a third person present singular subject only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects189 auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive past or progressive forms they form complex tenses aspects and moods auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence207208 most verbs have six inflectional forms the primary forms are a plain present a third person singular present and a preterite past form the secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive a gerundparticiple and a past participle209 the verb to be which among other uses in english functions as the primary auxillary verb indicating the imperfective aspect eg i am going as well as the copula210 is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject the first person present form is am the third person singular form is is and the form are is used in the second person singular and all three plurals the only verb past participle is been and its gerundparticiple is being211 english has two primary tenses past preterite and nonpast the preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ed and for the strong verbs either the suffix t or a change in the stem vowel the nonpast form is unmarked except in the third person singular which takes the suffix s207 english does not have future verb forms212 the future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall213 many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to goingto future214 further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs primarily have and be which show the contrast between a perfect and nonperfect past tense i have run vs i was running and compound tenses such as preterite perfect i had been running and present perfect i have been running215 for the expression of mood english uses a number of modal auxiliaries such as can may will shall and the past tense forms could might would should there are also subjunctive and imperative moods both based on the plain form of the verb ie without the third person singular s for use in subordinate clauses eg subjunctive it is important that he run every day imperative run213 an infinitive form that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form in clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause216 for example he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive or in a complement clause such as i saw him leave where the main verb is see which is in a preterite form and leave is in the infinitive english also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb the phrase then functions as a single predicate in terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb but in writing it is written as a separate word examples of phrasal verbs are to get up to ask out to get together and to put up with the phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement eg lay off meaning terminate someones employment217 some grammarians do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term phrasal verb instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement eg he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent218 the function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs179 many english adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix ly for example in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly is derived from the adjective quick some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms such as good which has the adverbial form well219 modern english syntax is moderately analytic220 it has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions negative polarity the passive voice and progressive aspect221 english has moved from the germanic verbsecond v2 word order to being almost exclusively subjectverbobject svo222 the combination of svo order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence such as he had been hoping to try opening it223 in most sentences english only marks grammatical relations through word order224 the subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb an exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun in which case it is doubly marked both by word order and by case inflection where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form225 the example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun indirect objects io of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction s v io o such as i gave jane the book or in a prepositional phrase such as i gave the book to jane226 english sentences may be composed of one or more clauses that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases eg noun phrases verb phrases prepositional phrases a clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents such as any noun or prepositional phrases within a sentence there is always at least one main clause or matrix clause whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause for example in the phrase i think that you are lying the main clause is headed by the verb think the subject is i but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause that you are lying the subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause but it is often omitted227 relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause for example in the sentence i saw the letter that you received today the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter the object of the main clause relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who whose whom and which as well as by that which can also be omitted228 in contrast to many other germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses229 english auxiliary verbs are relied upon for many functions including the expression of tense aspect and mood auxiliary verbs form main clauses and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb for example in the sentence the dog did not find its bone the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not subjectauxiliary inversion is used in many constructions including focus negation and interrogative constructions230 the verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences where it usually serves to add emphasis as in i did shut the fridge however in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above it is used because the rules of english syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present modern english does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb as in i know not it can only be added to an auxiliary or copular verb hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required the auxiliary do is used to produce a form like i do not dont know the same applies in clauses requiring inversion including most questions inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb so it is not possible to say know you him grammatical rules require do you know him231 negation is done with the adverb not which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb a contracted form of not nt can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be just as with questions many negative constructions require the negation to occur with dosupport thus in modern english i dont know him is the correct answer to the question do you know him but not i know him not although this construction may be found in older english232 passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs a passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase they are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get although not all varieties of english allow the use of passives with get for example putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen by her or he gets seen by her233 both yesno questions and whquestions in english are mostly formed using subjectauxiliary inversion am i going tomorrow where can we eat which may require dosupport do you like her where did he go in most cases interrogative words or whwords which include who what when where why and how appear in a fronted position for example in the question what did you see the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence when the whword is the subject or forms part of the subject no inversion occurs eg who saw the cat prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the questions theme eg to whose house did you go last night the personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case with the variant whom serving as the objective case form although this form may be going out of use in many contexts234 while english is a subjectprominent language at the discourse level it tends to use a topiccomment structure where the known information topic precedes the new information comment because of the strict svo syntax the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence in cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means one way of doing this is through a passive construction the girl was stung by the bee another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there eg it was the girl that the bee stung there was a girl who was stung by a bee235 dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs eg it is raining or in existential clauses there are many cars on the street through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects english is able to maintain both a topiccomment sentence structure and a svo syntax236 focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent for example the girl was stung by a bee emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her or the girl was stung by a bee contrasting with another possibility for example that it was the boy237 topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause for example that girl over there she was stung by a bee emphasises the girl by preposition but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition she was stung by a bee that girl over there where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought238 cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora eg that is exactly what i mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event239 discourse markers such as oh so or well also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said for example no way is that true the idiomatic marker no way expressing disbelief or boy im hungry the marker boy expressing emphasis while discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of english they are also used in written and formal registers240 the english lexicon consists of around 170000 words or 220000 if counting obsolete words according to an estimate based on the 1989 edition of the oxford english dictionary241 over onehalf are nouns onequarter are adjectives and oneseventh are verbs another estimate which includes scientific jargon prefixed and suffixed words loanwords of extremely limited use technical acronyms etc counts around 1 million total english words242 english borrows vocabulary quickly from many languages and other sources early studies of english vocabulary by lexicographers scholars who study vocabulary and compile dictionaries were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from highquality linguistic corpora243 collections of actual written texts and spoken passages many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of english vocabulary over time the dates of first use of various words in english and the sources of english vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analyses of linguistic corpus data become available244245 english forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes one of the most productive processes in english is conversion246 using a word with a different grammatical role for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun another productive wordformation process is nominal compounding242245 producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick246 formation of new words called neologisms based on greek or latin roots for example television or optometry is a highly productive process in modern european languages like english so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated for this reason american lexicographer philip gove attributed many such words to the international scientific vocabulary isv when compiling websters third new international dictionary 1961 another active wordformation process in english is that of acronyms which result from pronouncing abbreviations of longer phrases as single words eg nato laser scuba247 throughout its history english has been a particularly frequent borrower of loanwords from other languages249 west germanic words in use since the anglosaxon period still comprise most of the languages core vocabulary as well as most of its most frequently used words250251242 many sentences can be constructed without loanwords but not without core anglosaxon vocabulary252 english has formal and informal speech registers informal registers including childdirected speech tend to be made up predominantly of anglosaxon vocabulary while latinate vocabulary appears more frequently in legal scientific and academic writing253254 prolonged and intense contact with french has resulted in english having a very high proportion of latinate words with french loanwords borrowed during different stages of the languages history comprising 28 percent of the english lexicon255 in all periods of its history english has also borrowed words from latin directly245242 representing another 28 percent of the lexicon256 in turn many of these words had originally entered latin from greek greek and latin stems remain highly productive sources for new literary technical and scientific vocabulary in english257 loanwords from old norse primarily entered english between the 8th and 11th centuries during the norse colonisation of eastern and northern england and typically displaced an anglosaxon equivalent many represent core vocabulary including give get sky skirt egg and cake25839 english has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages255259 the influence of english comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the english language the role of english as a world lingua franca and the large number of books and films that are translated from english into other languages260 that pervasive use of english leads to a conclusion in many places that english is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies among varieties of english it is especially american english that influences other languages261 some languages such as chinese write words borrowed from english mostly as calques while others such as japanese readily take in english loanwords written in soundindicating script262 dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of english influence on languages in europe262 since the 9th century english has been written using the english alphabet which uses the latin script anglosaxon runes were previously used to write old english but only in short inscriptions the overwhelming majority of attested writings in old english are in the old english latin alphabet33 english orthography is multilayered and complex with elements of french latin and greek spelling on top of the native germanic system263 further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace50 compared to european languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms english has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced264 there are also systematic spelling differences between british and american english these situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in english265 although letters and speech sounds do not have a onetoone correspondence in standard english spelling spelling rules that take into account syllable structure phonetic changes in derived words and word accent are reliable for most english words266 moreover standard english spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling for example the words photograph photography and photographic266 or the words electricity and electrical while few scholars agree with chomsky and halle 1968 that conventional english orthography is nearoptimal263 there is a rationale for current english spelling patterns267 the standard orthography of english is the most widely used writing system in the world268 standard english spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word269 readers of english can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds the letters b d f h j k l m n p r s t v w y z represent respectively the phonemes b d f h d k l m n p r s t v w j z the letters c and g normally represent k and but there is also a soft c pronounced s and a soft g pronounced d the differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard english spelling digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for t sh for th for or ng for qu for kw and ph for f in greekderived words the single letter x is generally pronounced as z in wordinitial position and as ks otherwise there are exceptions to these generalisations often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin266 or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of modern english to follow the spelling patterns of latin for english words of germanic origin270 for the vowel sounds of the english language however correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular there are many more vowel phonemes in english than there are single vowel letters a e i o u y and very rarely w as a result some long vowels are often indicated by combinations of letters like the oa in boat the ow in how and the ay in stay or the historically based silent e as in note and cake267 the consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in english it can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of english than of many other languages including italian spanish and german271 nonetheless there is an advantage for learners of english reading in learning the specific soundsymbol regularities that occur in the standard english spellings of commonly used words266 such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in english272273 making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in english may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write english274 english writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world the purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud275 dialectologists identify many english dialects which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar vocabulary and pronunciation the pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents the major native dialects of english are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of british english bre and north american english nae276 the fact that english has been spoken in england for 1500 years explains why england has a great wealth of regional dialects277 within the united kingdom received pronunciation rp an educated accent associated originally with south east england has been traditionally used as a broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of british accents the spread of rp also known as bbc english through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural england to recede as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects at the time of the 195061 survey of english dialects grammar and vocabulary differed across the country but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear278 nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary in fact only 3 of the english population actually speak rp the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of rp influence279 there is also variability within rp particularly along class lines between upper and middleclass rp speakers and between native rp speakers and speakers who adopt rp later in life280 within britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class some traits though exceedingly common are nonetheless considered nonstandard and associated with lowerclass speakers and identities an example of this is hdropping which was historically a feature of lowerclass london english particularly cockney and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of england however it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of british society281 english in england can be divided into four major dialect regions south east english south west english also known as west country english midlands english and northern english within each of these regions several local dialects exist within the northern region there is a division between the yorkshire dialects the geordie dialect spoken around newcastle in northumbria and the lancashire dialects which include the urban subdialects of manchester mancunian and liverpool scouse having been the centre of danish occupation during the viking invasions of england northern english dialects particularly the yorkshire dialect retain norse features not found in other english varieties282 in the west midlands dialects such as black country yam yam and by less extent birmingham brummie preserve archaic features from early modern and middle english retaining germanic elements such as specific grammatical structures and vocabulary283 since the 15th century south east england varieties have centred on london which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects in london the cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes and it was long a socially stigmatised variety the spread of cockney features across the south east led the media to talk of estuary english as a new dialect but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that london had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history284285286 traits that have spread from london in recent decades include the use of intrusive r drawing is pronounced drawring drr tglottalisation potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as poer p and thfronting or the pronunciation of th as f thanks pronounced fanks or v bother pronounced bover287 scots is today considered a separate language from english but it has its origins in early northern middle english288 and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources particularly scottish gaelic and old norse scots itself has a number of regional dialects in addition to scots scottish english comprises the varieties of standard english spoken in scotland most varieties are northern english accents with some influence from scots289 in ireland various forms of english have been spoken following the norman invasion of the island during the 11th century in county wexford and in the area surrounding dublin two extinct dialects known as forth and bargy and fingallian developed as offshoots from early middle english and were spoken until the 19th century modern irish english however has its roots in english colonisation in the 17th century today irish english is divided into ulster english the northern ireland dialect with strong influence from scots and various dialects of the republic of ireland like scottish and most north american accents almost all irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by rp19290 due to the relatively strong degree of mixing mutual accommodation and koinisation that occurred during the colonial period north american english has traditionally been perceived as relatively homogeneous at least in comparison with british dialects however modern scholars have strongly opposed this notion arguing that north american english shows a great deal of phonetic lexical and geographic variability this becomes all the more apparent considering social ethnolinguistic and regional varieties such as africanamerican english chicano english cajun english or newfoundland english291 american accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level292 though most americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents293 known collectively as general american english ga with differences hardly noticed even among americans themselves including midland and western american english294295296 canadian english varieties excepting those from atlantic canada and possibly quebec are generally considered to belong to the ga continuum although they often show raising of the vowels a and a before voiceless consonants and have distinct norms for writing and pronunciation as well297 atlantic canadian english notably distinct from standard canadian english298 comprises maritime english and newfoundland english it was influenced mostly by british and irish english as well as irish scottish gaelic and acadian french299 in most american and canadian english dialects rhoticity or rfullness is dominant with nonrhoticity or rdropping being associated with lower prestige and social class especially since the end of world war ii this contrasts with the situation in england where nonrhoticity has become the standard300 varieties beyond ga which have developed distinct sound systems include the southern american english new york city english eastern new england english and africanamerican vernacular english aave groups all of which are historically nonrhotic save a few varieties of southern american in southern american english the most populous grouping outside ga301 rhoticity now strongly prevails replacing the regions historical nonrhotic prestige302303304 southern accents are colloquially described as a drawl or twang305 being recognised most readily by the southern vowel shift initiated by glidedeleting in the a vowel eg pronouncing spy almost like spa the southern breaking of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables eg pronouncing the word press almost like prayus306 the pinpen merger and other distinctive phonological grammatical and lexical features many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later307 spoken primarily by working and middleclass african americans africanamerican vernacular english aave is largely nonrhotic and likely originated among enslaved africans and african americans influenced primarily by the nonstandard older southern dialects a minority of linguists308 contrarily propose that aave mostly traces back to african languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or englishbased creole to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins309 aaves important commonalities with southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century aave is commonly stigmatised in north america as a form of broken or uneducated english as are white southern accents but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of english with their own norms shared by large speech communities310311 since 1788 english has been spoken in oceania and australian english has developed as the first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the australian continent its standard accent being general australian the english of neighbouring new zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language312 australian and new zealand english are each others closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics followed by south african english and the english of south east england all of which have similarly nonrhotic accents aside from some accents in the south island of new zealand australian and new zealand english stand out for their innovative vowels many short vowels are fronted or raised whereas many long vowels have diphthongised australian english also has a contrast between long and short vowels not found in most other varieties australian english grammar aligns closely with british and american english like american english collective plural subjects take on a singular verb eg the government is rather than are313314 new zealand english uses front vowels that are often even higher than in australian english315316317 english is an official language of the philippines its use is ubiquitous in the country and appears in areas including on street signs marquees and government documents and in courtrooms public media the entertainment industry and the business sector it became an important and widely spoken language in the country during the period of american rule between 1898 and 1946318 taglish is a prominent form of codeswitching between tagalog and english319 english is spoken widely in southern africa and is an official or coofficial language in several of the regions countries in south africa english has been spoken since 1820 coexisting with afrikaans and various african languages such as the khoe and bantu languages today about nine percent of the south african population speaks south african english sae as a first language sae is a nonrhotic variety that tends to follow rp as a norm it is one of the few nonrhotic english varieties that lack intrusive r the secondlanguage varieties of south africa differ based on the native languages of their speakers320 most phonological differences from rp are in the vowels321 consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce p t t k without aspiration eg pin pronounced pn rather than as pn as in most other varieties while r is often pronounced as a flap instead of as the more common fricative322 nigerian english is a variety of english spoken in nigeria over 150 million nigerians speak some form of the language323 though traditionally based on british english increasing united states influence during the latter 20th century has resulted in american english vocabulary entering nigerian english additionally some new words and collocations have emerged from the variety out of a need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation eg senior wife324 varieties of english are spoken throughout the former british colonial possessions in the caribbean including jamaica the leeward and windward islands trinidad and tobago barbados the cayman islands and belize each of these areas is home both to a local variety of english and a local englishbased creole combining english and african languages the most prominent varieties are jamaican english and jamaican creole in central america englishbased creoles are spoken on the caribbean coasts of nicaragua and panama325 residents are often fluent in both the local english variety and the local creole languages and frequently codeswitch between them the relationship between different varieties can be conceptualised as a continuum in which more creolelike or rplike forms function as more formal and informal registers of the language respectively326 most caribbean varieties are based on british english and consequently most are nonrhotic except for formal styles of jamaican english which are often rhotic jamaican english differs from rp in its vowel inventory which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in standard english the diphthongs ei and ou are monophthongs e and o or even the reverse diphthongs ie and uo eg bay and boat pronounced be and bot often wordfinal consonant clusters are simplified so that child is pronounced tail and wind win327328329 indian english historically tends towards rp as an ideal with the proximity of speakers to rp generally reflective of class distinctions indian english accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as t and d often pronounced with retroflex articulation as and and the replacement of and with dentals t and d sometimes indian english speakers may also use spellingbased pronunciations where the silent h found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an indian voiced aspirated stop 330 nonnative english speakers may pronounce words differently due to having not fully mastered english pronunciation this can happen either because they apply the speech rules of their mother tongue to english interference or through implementing strategies similar to those used in first language acquisition they may create novel pronunciations for english sounds not found in their first language331
