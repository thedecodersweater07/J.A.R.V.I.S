postwar the v2 german vergeltungswaffe 2 lit vengeance weapon 2 with the technical name aggregat4 a4 was the worlds first longrange4 guided ballistic missile the missile powered by a liquidpropellant rocket engine was developed during the second world war in nazi germany as a vengeance weapon and assigned to attack allied cities as retaliation for the allied bombings of german cities the v2 rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the krmn line edge of space with the vertical launch of mw 18014 on 20 june 19445 research of military use of longrange rockets began when the graduate studies of wernher von braun were noticed by the german army a series of prototypes culminated in the a4 which went to war as the v2 beginning in september 1944 more than 3000 v2s were launched by the wehrmacht against allied targets first london and later antwerp and lige according to a 2011 bbc documentary6 the attacks from v2s resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9000 civilians and military personnel while a further 12000 labourers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons7 the rockets travelled at supersonic speeds impacted without audible warning and proved unstoppable no effective defense existed teams from the allied forcesthe united states the united kingdom france and the soviet unionraced to seize major german manufacturing facilities procure the germans missile technology and capture the v2s launching sites von braun and more than 100 core rd v2 personnel surrendered to the americans and many of the original v2 team transferred their work to the redstone arsenal where they were relocated as part of operation paperclip the us also captured enough v2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles the soviets gained possession of the v2 manufacturing facilities after the war reestablished v2 production and moved it to the soviet union during the late 1920s a young wernher von braun bought a copy of hermann oberths book die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket into interplanetary spaces in 1928 a raketenrummel or rocket rumble fad in the popular media was initiated by fritz von opel and max valier a collaborator of oberth by experimenting with rockets including public demonstrations of manned rocket cars and rocket planes the rocket rumble was highly influential on von braun as a teenage space enthusiast he was so enthusiastic after seeing one of the public opelrak rocket car demonstrations that he constructed and launched his own homemade toy rocket car on a crowded sidewalk and was later taken in for questioning by the local police until released to his father for disciplinary action8 starting in 1930 von braun attended the technische hochschule in charlottenburg now technische universitt berlin where he assisted oberth in liquidfueled rocket motor tests von braun was working on his doctorate when the nazi party gained power in germany an artillery captain walter dornberger arranged an ordnance department research grant for von braun who from then on worked next to dornbergers existing solidfuel rocket test site at kummersdorf von brauns thesis construction theoretical and experimental solution to the problem of the liquid propellant rocket dated 16 april 1934 was kept classified by the german army and was not published until 19609 by the end of 1934 his group had successfully launched two rockets that reached heights of 22 and 35 km 14 and 22 mi at the time many germans were interested in american physicist robert h goddards research before 1939 german engineers and scientists occasionally contacted goddard directly with technical questions von braun used goddards plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the aggregate a series of rockets named for the german word for mechanism or mechanical system10 after successes at kummersdorf with the first two aggregate series rockets braun and walter riedel began thinking of a much larger rocket in the summer of 193611 based on a projected 25000 kg 55000 lb thrust engine in addition dornberger specified the military requirements needed to include a 1ton payload a range of 172 miles with a dispersion of 2 or 3 miles and transportable using road vehicles12 5051 after the a4 project was postponed due to unfavorable aerodynamic stability testing of the a3 in july 19361314 braun specified the a4 performance in 193715 and after an extensive series of test firings of the a5 scale test model16 using a motor redesigned from the troublesome a3 by walter thiel16 a4 design and construction was ordered c 19383917 during 2830 september 1939 der tag der weisheit english the day of wisdom conference met at peenemnde to initiate the funding of university research to solve rocket problems11 40 by late 1941 the army research center at peenemnde possessed the technologies essential to the success of the a4 the four main technologies for the a4 were large liquidfuel rocket engines supersonic aerodynamics gyroscopic guidance and rudders in jet control3 at the time adolf hitler was not particularly impressed by the v2 he opined that it was merely an artillery shell with a longer range and much higher cost18 during early september 1943 braun promised the longrange bombardment commission3 224 that the a4 development was practically completeconcluded14 135 but even by the middle of 1944 a complete a4 parts list was still unavailable3 224 hitler was sufficiently impressed by the enthusiasm of its developers and needed a wonder weapon to maintain german morale18 so he authorized its deployment in large numbers19 the v2s were constructed at the mittelwerk site by prisoners from mittelbaudora a concentration camp where 20000 prisoners died2021page needed22 in 1943 an austrian resistance group led by heinrich maier managed to send exact drawings of the v2 rocket to the american office of strategic services location sketches of vrocket manufacturing facilities such as those in peenemnde were also sent to the allied general staff in order to enable allied bombers to perform airstrikes this information was particularly important for operation crossbow and operation hydra both preliminary missions for operation overlord the group was gradually captured by the gestapo and most of the members were executed2324252627 the a4 used a 75 ethanol25 water mixture bstoff for fuel and liquid oxygen lox astoff for oxidizer28 the water reduced the flame temperature acted as a coolant by turning to steam and augmented the thrust tended to produce a smoother burn and reduced thermal stress29 rudolf hermanns supersonic wind tunnel was used to measure the a4s aerodynamic characteristics and center of pressure using a model of the a4 within a 40 square centimeter chamber measurements were made using a mach 186 blowdown nozzle on 8 august 1940 tests at mach numbers 156 and 25 were made after 24 september 194030 7678 at launch the a4 propelled itself for up to 65 seconds on its own power and a program motor held the inclination at the specified angle until engine shutdown after which the rocket continued on a ballistic freefall trajectory the rocket reached a height of 80 km 50 mi or 264000 ft after shutting off the engine31 the fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine fueled by decomposition of concentrated hydrogen peroxide tstoff facilitated by a sodium permanganate zstoff catalyst both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminummagnesium alloy1 the turbopump rotating at 4000 rpm forced the fuel mixture and oxygen into the combustion chamber at 125 liters 33 us gallons per second where they were ignited by a spinning electrical igniter the engine produced 8 tons of thrust during the preliminary stage whilst the fuel was gravityfed before increasing to 25 tons as the turbopump pressurised the fuel lifting the 135 ton rocket combustion gases exited the chamber at 2820 c 5100 f and a speed of 2000 m 6600 ft per second the oxygen to fuel mixture was 10085 at 25 tons of thrust as ambient pressure decreased with flight altitude thrust increased to 29 tons123233 the turbopump assembly contained two centrifugal pumps one for the fuel mixture and one for the oxygen the turbine was connected directly by a shaft to the alcohol pump and through a flexible joint and shaft to the oxygen pump34 the turbopump delivered 55 kg 121 lb of alcohol and 68 kg 150 lb of liquid oxygen per second to a combustion chamber at 15 mpa 218 psi30 dr thiels 25 ton rocket motor design relied on pump feeding as opposed to earlier pressurefed designs the motor used centrifugal injection and used both regenerative cooling and film cooling film cooling admitted alcohol into the combustion chamber and exhaust nozzle under slight pressure through four rings of small perforations the mushroomshaped injection head was removed from the combustion chamber to a mixing chamber the combustion chamber was made more spherical while being shortened from 6 to 1foot in length and the connection to the nozzle was made cone shaped the resultant 15 ton chamber operated at a combustion pressure of 152 mpa 220 psi thiels 15 ton chamber was then scaled up to a 45 ton motor by arranging three injection heads above the combustion chamber by 1939 eighteen injection heads in two concentric circles at the head of the 3 mm 012 in thick sheetsteel chamber were used to make the 25 ton motor12 5255 30 the warhead was a source of trouble the explosive used was amatol 6040 detonated by an electric contact fuze amatol had the advantage of stability and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of glass wool but even so it could still explode during the reentry phase the warhead weighed 975 kilograms 2150 lb and contained 910 kilograms 2010 lb of explosive the warheads explosive percentage by weight was 93 a very high portion compared to other types of munitions a protective layer of glass wool was also used for the fuel tanks to prevent the a4 from forming ice a problem which plagued other early ballistic missiles such as the balloon tankdesign sm65 atlas which entered us service in 1959 the tanks held 4173 kilograms 9200 lb of ethyl alcohol and 5553 kilograms 12242 lb of oxygen35 the v2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins and four internal graphite vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor these 8 control surfaces were controlled by helmut hlzers analog computer the mischgert via electricalhydraulic servomotors based on electrical signals from the gyros the siemens vertikant lev3 guidance system consisted of two free gyroscopes a horizontal for pitch and a vertical with two degrees of freedom for yaw and roll for lateral stabilization coupled with a piga accelerometer or the walter wolman radio control system to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity other gyroscopic systems used in the a4 included kreiselgertes sg66 and sg70 the v2 was launched from a presurveyed location so the distance and azimuth to the target were known fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth3630 8182 some later v2s used guide beams radio signals transmitted from the ground as an added input to the mischgert analog computer to keep the missile on course in azimuth37 the flying distance was controlled by the timing of the engine cutoff brennschluss groundcontrolled by a doppler system or by different types of onboard integrating accelerometers thus range was a function of engine burn time which ended when a specific velocity was achieved3212 203204 33 just before engine cutoff thrust was reduced to eight tons in an effort to avoid any water hammer problems a rapid cutoff could cause29 dr friedrich kirchstein of siemens of berlin developed the v2 radio control for motor cutoff german brennschluss14 28 124 for velocity measurement professor wolman of dresden created an alternative of his doppler38 18 tracking system in 194041 which used a ground signal transponded by the a4 to measure the velocity of the missile3 103 by 9 february 1942 peenemnde engineer gerd debeek had documented the radio interference area of a v2 as 10000 metres 33000 feet around the firing point39 and the first successful a4 flight on 3 october 1942 used radio control to command motor cutoff13 12 although hitler commented on 22 september 1943 that it is a great load off our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guidingbeam now no opening remains for the british to interfere technically with the missile in flight14 138 about 20 of the operational v2 launches were beamguided13 12 12 232 the operation pinguin v2 offensive began on 8 september 1944 when lehr und versuchsbatterie no 44438 512 english training and testing battery 444 launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at paris39 47 wreckage of combat v2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff11 259260 the painting of the operational v2s was mostly a raggededged pattern with several variations but at the end of the war a plain olive green rocket was also used during tests the rocket was painted in a characteristic blackandwhite chessboard pattern which aided in determining if the rocket was spinning around its longitudinal axis the original german designation of the rocket was v2740 unhyphenated exactly as used for any third reichera second prototype example of an rlmregistered german aircraft design but us publications such as life magazine were using the hyphenated form v2 as early as december 194441 the first successful test flight was on 3 october 1942 reaching an altitude of 845 kilometres 525 miles3 on that day walter dornberger declared in a meeting at peenemnde this third day of october 1942 is the first of a new era in transportation that of space travel1317 two test launches were recovered by the allies the bckebo rocket the remnants of which landed in sweden on 13 june 1944 and one recovered by the polish resistance on 30 may 194442 from the blizna v2 missile launch site and transported to the uk during operation most iii the highest altitude reached during the war was 1746 kilometres 1085 miles 20 june 19443 test launches of v2 rockets were made at peenemnde blizna and tuchola forest12 211 and after the war at cuxhaven by the british white sands proving grounds and cape canaveral by the us and kapustin yar by the ussr various design issues were identified and solved during v2 development and testing through midmarch 1944 only four of the 26 successful blizna launches had satisfactorily reached the sarnaki target area39 112 221222 282 due to inflight breakup luftzerleger on reentry into the atmosphere43 100 as mentioned above one rocket was collected by the polish home army with parts of it transported to london for tests initially the german developers suspected excessive alcohol tank pressure but by april 1944 after five months of test firings the cause was still not determined majorgeneral rossmann the army weapons office department chief recommended stationing observers in the target area c mayjune dornberger and von braun set up a camp at the centre of the poland target zone44 after moving to the heidekraut11 172173 ss mortar battery 500 of the 836th artillery battalion motorized was ordered39 47 on 30 august38 to begin test launches of eighty sleeved rockets14 281 testing confirmed that the socalled tin trousers a tube designed to strengthen the forward end of the rocket cladding reduced the likelihood of air bursts43 100 12 188198 on 27 march 1942 dornberger proposed production plans and the building of a launching site on the channel coast in december speer ordered major thom and dr steinhoff to reconnoitre the site near watten assembly rooms were established at peenemnde and in the friedrichshafen facilities of zeppelin works in 1943 a third factory raxwerke was added12 7172 84 on 22 december 1942 hitler signed the order for mass production when albert speer assumed final technical data would be ready by july 1943 however many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 194345 on 8 january 1943 dornberger and von braun met with speer speer stated as head of the todt organisation i will take it on myself to start at once with the building of the launching site on the channel coast and established an a4 production committee under degenkolb12 7277 on 26 may 1943 the longrange bombardment commission chaired by aeg director petersen met at peenemnde to review the v1 and v2 automatic longrange weapons in attendance were speer air marshal erhard milch admiral karl dnitz col general friedrich fromm and karl saur both weapons had reached the final stage of development and the commission decided to recommend to hitler that both weapons be massproduced as dornberger observed the disadvantages of the one would be compensated by the others advantages12 8384 8792 on 7 july 1943 major general dornberger von braun and dr steinhof briefed hitler in his wolfs lair also in attendance were speer wilhelm keitel and alfred jodl the briefing included von braun narrating a movie showing the successful launch on 3 october 1942 with scale models of the channel coast firing bunker and supporting vehicles including the meillerwagen hitler then gave peenemnde top priority in the german armaments program stating why was it i could not believe in the success of your work if we had had these rockets in 1939 we should never have had this war hitler also wanted a second launch bunker built12 93105 saur planned to build 2000 rockets per month between the existing three factories and the nordhausen mittelwerk factory being built however alcohol production was dependent upon the potato harvest12 97 102105 a production line was nearly ready at peenemnde when the operation hydra attack occurred the main targets of the attack included the test stands the development works the preproduction works the settlement where the scientists and technicians lived the trassenheide camp and the harbor sector according to dornberger serious damage to the works contrary to first impressions was surprisingly small work resumed after a delay of four to six weeks and because of camouflage to mimic complete destruction there were no more raids during the next nine months the raid resulted in 735 lives lost with heavy losses at trassenheide while 178 were killed in the settlement including dr thiel his family and chief engineer walther12 139152 the germans eventually moved production to the underground mittelwerk in the kohnstein where 5200 v2 rockets were built with the use of forced labour46 after the operation crossbow bombing initial plans for launching from the massive underground watten wizernes and sottevast bunkers or from fixed pads such as near the chteau du molay47 were dismissed in favour of mobile launching eight main storage dumps were planned and four had been completed by july 1944 the one at merysuroise was begun during august 1943 and completed by february 194448 the missile could be launched practically anywhere roads running through forests being a particular favourite the system was so mobile and small that only one meillerwagen was ever caught in action by allied aircraft during the operation bodenplatte attack on 1 january 194549 near lochem by a usaaf 4th fighter group aircraft although raymond baxter described flying over a site during a launch and his wingman firing at the missile without hitting it it was estimated that a sustained rate of 350 v2s could be launched per week with 100 per day at maximum effort given sufficient supply of the rockets50 the lxv armeekorps zbv formed during the last days of november 1943 in france commanded by general der artillerie zv erich heinemann was responsible for the operational use of v252 three launch battalions were formed in late 1943 artillerie abteilung 836 mot grossborn artillerie abteilung 485 mot naugard and artillerie abteilung 962 mot combat operations commenced in sept 1944 when training batterie 444 deployed on 2 september 1944 the ss werferabteilung 500 was formed and by october the ss under the command of ss lt gen hans kammler took operational control of all units he formed gruppe sd with art abt 836 merzig and gruppe nord with art abt 485 and batterie 444 burgsteinfurt and the hague53 after hitlers 29 august 1944 declaration to begin v2 attacks as soon as possible the offensive began on 7 september 1944 when two were launched at paris which the allies had liberated less than two weeks earlier but both crashed soon after launch on 8 september a single rocket was launched at paris which caused modest damage near porte ditalie11 218 220 467 two more launches by the 485th followed including one from the hague against london on the same day at 643 pm14 285 the first landed at staveley road chiswick killing 63yearold mrs ada harrison threeyearold rosemary clarke and sapper bernard browning on leave from the royal engineers15 11 and one that hit epping with no casualties the british government concerned about spreading panic or giving away vital intelligence to german forces initially attempted to conceal the cause of the explosions by making no official announcement and euphemistically blaming them on defective gas mains54 the public did not believe this explanation and therefore began referring to the v2s as flying gas mains55 the germans themselves finally announced the v2 on 8 november 1944 and only then on 10 november 1944 did winston churchill inform parliament and the world that england had been under rocket attack for the last few weeks56 in september 1944 control of the v2 mission was transferred to the waffenss and division zv5758 positions of the german launch units changed a number of times for example artillerie init 444 arrived in the southwest netherlands in zeeland in september 1944 from a field near the village of serooskerke five v2s were launched on 15 and 16 september with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th that same date a transport carrying a missile took a wrong turn and ended up in serooskerke itself giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon these were smuggled to london by the dutch resistance59 after that the unit moved to the woods near rijs gaasterland in the northwest netherlands to ensure that the technology was not captured by the allies from gaasterland v2s were launched against ipswich and norwich from 25 september london being out of range because of their inaccuracy these v2s did not hit their target cities soon after that only london and antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by adolf hitler himself antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 october after which time the unit moved to the hague during the succeeding months about 3172 v2 rockets were fired at the following targets61 antwerp belgium was a target for a large number of vweapon attacks from october 1944 through to the virtual end of the war in march 1945 leaving 1736 dead and 4500 injured in greater antwerp thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed as the city was struck by 590 direct hits hitlers hope that the port of antwerp dock gates wold be would be hit and the port put out of action was not achieved62 the largest loss of life by a single rocket attack during the war came on 16 december 1944 when the roof of the crowded cine rex was struck leaving 567 dead and 291 injured6364 an estimated 2754 civilians were killed in london by v2 attacks with another 6523 injured65 which is two people killed per v2 rocket the death toll in london did not meet the nazis full expectations during early usage as they had not yet perfected the accuracy of the v2 with many rockets being misdirected and exploding harmlessly accuracy increased during the war particularly for batteries where the leitstrahl radio guide beam system was used66 missile strikes that did hit targets could cause large numbers of deaths 160 were killed and 108 seriously injured in one explosion at 1226 pm on 25 november 1944 at a woolworths department store in new cross southeast london67 british intelligence also helped impede the effectiveness of the nazi weapon sending false reports via their doublecross system implying that the rockets were overshooting their london target by 10 to 20 miles 16 to 32 km this tactic worked more than half of the v2s aimed at london landed short of the london civil defence region68 459 most landed on lessheavily populated areas in kent due to erroneous recalibration for the remainder of the war british intelligence maintained the ruse by repeatedly sending bogus reports implying that these failed rockets were striking the british capital with heavy loss of life69 at least one v2 missile on a mobile meillerwagen launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a usaaf 4th fighter group pilot defending against the massive new years day 1945 operation bodenplatte strike by the luftwaffe over the northern german attack route near the town of lochem on 1 january 1945 possibly from the potential sighting of the american fighter by the missiles launch crew the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launchready 85 elevation to 3070 after the us army captured the ludendorff bridge during the battle of remagen on 7 march 1945 the germans were desperate to destroy it on 17 march 1945 they fired eleven v2 missiles at the bridge their first use against a tactical target and the only time they were fired on a german target during the war71 they could not employ the more accurate leitstrahl device because it was oriented towards antwerp and could not be easily adjusted for another target fired from near hellendoorn the netherlands one of the missiles landed as far away as cologne 40 miles 64 km to the north while one missed the bridge by only 500 to 800 yards 460 to 730 m they also struck the town of remagen destroying a number of buildings and killing at least six american soldiers72 the final two rockets exploded on 27 march 1945 one of these was the last v2 to kill a british civilian and the final civilian casualty of the war on british soil ivy millichamp aged 34 killed in her home in kynaston road orpington in kent7374 a scientific reconstruction performed in 2010 demonstrated that the v2 creates a crater 20 metres 66 feet wide and 8 metres 26 feet deep ejecting approximately 3000 tons of material into the air69 unlike the v1 the v2s speed and trajectory made it practically invulnerable to antiaircraft guns and fighters as it dropped from an altitude of 100110 km 6268 mi at up to three times the speed of sound at sea level approximately 3550 kmh 2206 mph nevertheless the threat of what was then codenamed big ben was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures the situation was similar to the prewar concerns about manned bombers and resulted in a similar solution the formation of the crossbow committee to collect examine and develop countermeasures early on it was believed that the v2 employed some form of radio guidance a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver this resulted in efforts to jam this nonexistent guidance system as early as september 1944 using both ground and airbased jammers flying over the uk in october a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch by december it was clear these systems were not having any obvious effect and jamming efforts ended75 general frederick alfred pile commander of antiaircraft command studied the problem and proposed that enough antiaircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rockets path but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory the first estimates suggested that 320000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket about 2 of these were expected to fall back to the ground unexploded containing almost 90 tons of explosives which would cause far more damage than the missile at a 25 august 1944 meeting of the crossbow committee the concept was rejected75 pile continued studying the problem and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to earth unexploded some lowlevel analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in hyde park that were provided with preconfigured firing data for 25mile 40kilometre grids of the london area after the trajectory was determined the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds75 at a crossbow meeting on 15 january 1945 piles updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from roderic hill and charles drummond ellis however the committee suggested that a test not be performed as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed by march this had changed significantly with 81 of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into or the one beside it at a 26 march meeting pile was directed to a subcommittee with rv jones and ellis to further develop the statistics three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down plans for an operational test began but as pile later put it monty beat us to it as the attacks ended with the allied capture of their launching areas75 with the germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking london they began targeting antwerp plans were made to move the pile system to protect that city but the war ended before anything could be done75 the only effective defences against the v2 campaign were to destroy the launch infrastructureexpensive in terms of bomber resources and casualtiesor to cause the germans to aim at the wrong place by disinformation the british were able to convince the germans to direct v1s and v2s aimed at london to less populated areas east of the city this was done by sending deceptive reports on the sites hit and damage caused via the german espionage network in britain which was secretly controlled by the british the doublecross system76 according to the bbc television presenter raymond baxter who served with the raf during the war in february 1945 his squadron was performing a mission against a v2 launch site when they saw one missile being launched one member of baxters squadron opened fire on it without effect77 on 3 march 1945 the allies attempted to destroy v2s and launching equipment in the haagse bos in the hague by a largescale bombardment but due to navigational errors the bezuidenhout quarter was destroyed killing 511 dutch civilians the german vweapons v1 and v2 cost the equivalent of about us500 million78 given the relatively smaller size of the german economy this represented an industrial effort equivalent to but slightly less than that of the us manhattan project that produced the atomic bomb 6048 v2s were built at a cost of approximately 100000 2370000 in 2011 eachcitation needed 3225 were launched ss general hans kammler who as an engineer had constructed several concentration camps including auschwitz had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers for the rocket program more people died manufacturing the v2 than were killed by its deployment79 those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to wernher von braun we knew that each v2 cost as much to produce as a highperformance fighter airplane we knew that german forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes and that the v2 rockets were doing us no military damage from our point of view the v2 program was almost as good as if hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament the v2 consumed a third of germanys fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies81 due to a lack of explosives some warheads were simply filled with concrete using the kinetic energy alone for destruction and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of german citizens who had died in allied bombings82 the psychological effect of the v2 was considerable as the v2 traveling faster than the speed of sound gave no warning before impact unlike bombing planes or the v1 flying bomb which made a characteristic buzzing sound there was no effective defence and no risk of pilot or crew casualties an example of the impression it made is in the reaction of american pilot and future nuclear strategist and congressional aide william liscum borden who in november 1944 while returning from a nighttime air mission over holland saw a v2 in flight on its way to strike london8384 it resembled a meteor streaming red sparks and whizzing past us as though the aircraft were motionless i became convinced that it was only a matter of time until rockets would expose the united states to direct transoceanic attack85 with the war all but lost regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons the nazis resorted to vweapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily hence antwerp as v2 target as an extension of their desire to punish their foes and most importantly to give hope to their sympathizers with their miracle weapon18 the v2 did not affect the outcome of the war but it resulted in the development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the cold war which were also used for space exploration86 a submarinetowed launch platform was tested successfully making it the prototype for submarinelaunched ballistic missiles the project codename was prfstand xii test stand xii sometimes termed the rocket uboat if deployed it would have allowed a uboat to launch v2 missiles against united states cities though only with considerable effort and limited effect87 hitler in july 1944 and speer in january 1945 made speeches alluding to the scheme88 though germany did not possess the capability to fulfill these threats these schemes were met by the americans with operation teardropcitation needed while interned after the war by the british at csdic camp 11 dornberger was recorded saying that he had begged the fhrer to stop the vweapon propaganda because nothing more could be expected from one ton of explosive to this hitler had replied that dornberger might not expect more but he hitler certainly didcitation needed according to decrypted messages from the japanese embassy in germany twelve dismantled v2 rockets were shipped to japan89 these left bordeaux in august 1944 on the transport uboats u219 and u195 which reached jakarta in december 1944 a civilian v2 expert was a passenger on u234 bound for japan in may 1945 when the war ended in europe the fate of these v2 rockets is unknowncitation needed at the end of the war a competition began between the united states and the ussr to retrieve as many v2 rockets and staff as possible90 three hundred railcar loads of v2s and parts were captured and shipped to the united states and 126 of the principal designers including wernher von braun and walter dornberger were captives of the americans von braun his brother magnus von braun and seven others decided to surrender to the united states military operation paperclip to ensure they were not captured by the advancing soviets or shot dead by the nazis to prevent their capture91 after the nazi defeat german engineers were relocated to the united states the ussr france and the united kingdom where they further developed the v2 rocket for military and civilian purposes92 the v2 rocket also laid the foundation for the liquid fuel missiles and space launchers used later93 operation paperclip recruited german engineers and special mission v2 transported the captured v2 parts to the united states at the close of the second world war more than 300 rail cars filled with v2 engines fuselages propellant tanks gyroscopes and associated equipment were brought to the railyards in las cruces new mexico so they could be placed on trucks and driven to the white sands proving grounds also in new mexico in addition to v2 hardware the us government delivered german mechanization equations for the v2 guidance navigation and control systems as well as for advanced development concept vehicles to us defence contractors for analysis during the 1950s some of these documents were useful to us contractors in developing direction cosine matrix transformations and other inertial navigation architecture concepts that were applied to early us programs such as the atlas and minuteman guidance systems as well as the navys subs inertial navigation system94 a committee was formed with military and civilian scientists to review payload proposals for the reassembled v2 rockets by january 1946 the us army ordnance corps invited civilian scientists and engineers to participate in developing a space research program using the v2 the committee was initially named the v2 rocket panel then the v2 upper atmosphere research panel and finally the upper atmosphere rocket research panel95 this resulted in an eclectic array of experiments that flew on v2s and helped prepare for american manned space exploration devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine atmospheric pressures and to see what gases were present other instruments measured the level of cosmic radiation only 68 percent of the v2 trials were considered successful96 on 29 may 1947 a modified v2 had an error in its guidance and landed near juarez mexico causing an international incident97 the us navy attempted to launch a german v2 rocket at seaone test launch from the aircraft carrier uss midway was performed on 6 september 1947 as part of the navys operation sandy the test launch was a partial success the v2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some 10 km 6 mi from the carrier the launch setup on the midways deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over the arms pulled away just after the engine ignited releasing the missile the setup may look similar to the r7 semyorka launch procedure but in the case of the r7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket rather than just reacting to side forces the pgm11 redstone rocket is a direct descendant of the v298 the ussr captured a number of v2s and staff letting them stay in germany for a time99 the first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945 during october 1946 as part of operation osoaviakhim they were obliged to relocate to branch 1 of nii88 on gorodomlya island in lake seliger where helmut grttrup directed a group of 150 engineers100 in october 1947 a group of german scientists supported the ussr in launching rebuilt v2s in kapustin yar the german team was indirectly overseen by sergei korolev one of the leaders of the soviet rocketry program the first soviet missile was the r1 a duplicate of the v2 manufactured completely in the ussr which was launched first during october 1948 from 1947 until the end of 1950 the german team elaborated concepts and improvements for extended payload and range for the projects g1 g2 and g4 the german team had to remain on gorodomlya island until as late as 1952 and 1953 in parallel soviet work emphasized larger missiles the r2 and r5 based on further developing the v2 technology with using ideas of the german concept studies101 details of soviet achievements were unknown to the german team and completely underestimated by western intelligence until in november 1957 the satellite sputnik 1 was launched successfully to orbit by the sputnik rocket based on r7 the worlds first intercontinental ballistic missile102page needed between may and september of 1946 cepa the forerunner to todays french space agency cnes undertook the recruitment of approximately thirty german engineers who had previous experience working on rocket programs for nazi germany at the peenemnde army research center103 much like their counterparts in the united kingdom the united states and the soviet union frances objective was to acquire and advance the rocket technology developed by germany during world war ii the initial initiative known as the super v2 program had plans for four rocket variants capable of achieving ranges of up to 3600 km 2200 mi and carrying warheads weighing up to 1000 kg 2200 lb however this program was canceled in 1948 from 1950 to 1969 the research done on the super v2 program was repurposed to develop the vronique sounding rocket which became the first liquidfuel research rocket in western europe and was ultimately capable of carrying a 100 kg 220 lb payload to an altitude of 320 km 200 mi104 the vronique program then led to the diamant rocket and the ariane rocket family during october 1945 the allied operation backfire assembled a small number of v2 missiles and launched three of them from a site in northern germany the engineers involved had already agreed to relocate to the us when the test firings were complete the backfire report published in january 1946 contains extensive technical documentation of the rocket including all support procedures tailored vehicles and fuel composition105 in 1946 the british interplanetary society proposed an enlarged mancarrying version of the v2 named megaroc it could have enabled suborbital spaceflight similar to but at least a decade earlier than the mercuryredstone flights of 1961106107 the first chinese dongfeng missile the df1 was a licensed copy of the soviet r2 this design was produced during the 1960scitation needed at least 20 v2s still existed during 2014 complete missiles components
