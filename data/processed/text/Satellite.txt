a satellite or an artificial satellitea is an object typically a spacecraft placed into orbit around a celestial body they have a variety of uses including communication relay weather forecasting navigation gps broadcasting scientific research and earth observation additional military uses are reconnaissance early warning signals intelligence and potentially weapon delivery other satellites include the final rocket stages that place satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that later become defunct except for passive satellites most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations called transponders many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work the most popular of which are small cubesats similar satellites can work together as groups forming constellations because of the high launch cost to space most satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible most communication satellites are radio relay stations in orbit and carry dozens of transponders each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz spaceships become satellites by accelerating or decelerating to reach orbital velocities occupying an orbit high enough to avoid orbital decay due to drag in the presence of an atmosphere and above their roche limit satellites are spacecraft launched from the surface into space by launch systems satellites can then change or maintain their orbit by propulsion usually by chemical or ion thrusters as of 2018 about 90 of the satellites orbiting the earth are in low earth orbit or geostationary orbit geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky relative to a fixed point on the ground some imaging satellites choose a sunsynchronous orbit because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting as the number of satellites and amount of space debris around earth increases the threat of collision has become more severe an orbiter is a spacecraft that is designed to perform an orbital insertion entering orbit around an astronomical body from another1 and as such becoming an artificial satellite a small number of satellites orbit other bodies such as the moon mars and the sun or many bodies at once two for a halo orbit three for a lissajous orbit earth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance mapping monitoring the weather ocean forest etc space telescopes take advantage of outer spaces near perfect vacuum to observe objects with the entire electromagnetic spectrum because satellites can see a large portion of the earth at once communications satellites can relay information to remote places the signal delay from satellites and their orbits predictability are used in satellite navigation systems such as gps crewed spacecrafts which are in orbit or remain in orbit like space stations are artificial satellites as well the first artificial satellite launched into the earths orbit was the soviet unions sputnik 1 on october 4 1957 as of december 31 2022 there are 6718 operational satellites in the earths orbit of which 4529 belong to the united states 3996 commercial 590 belong to china 174 belong to russia and 1425 belong to other nations2 the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite was newtons cannonball a thought experiment by isaac newton to explain the motion of natural satellites in his philosophi naturalis principia mathematica 1687 the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon 186934 the idea surfaced again in jules vernes the begums fortune 1879 in 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky 18571935 published exploring space using jet propulsion devices which was the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and inferred that a multistage rocket fueled by liquid propellants could achieve this herman potonik explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book the problem of space travel he described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments the book described geostationary satellites first put forward by konstantin tsiolkovsky and discussed the communication between them and the ground using radio but fell short with the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays5 in a 1945 wireless world article english science fiction writer arthur c clarke described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet6 12 in may 1946 the united states air forces project rand released the preliminary design of an experimental worldcircling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century7 the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon8 in 1946 american theoretical astrophysicist lyman spitzer proposed an orbiting space telescope9 in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle by r r carhart10 this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by h k kallmann and w w kellogg11 the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 under the sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radiosignal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1s success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the socalled space race within the cold war in the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year 19571958 the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the us intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviet union announced its intention to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957 sputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika12 the dog was sent without possibility of return in early 1955 after being pressured by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year the army and navy worked on project orbiter with two competing programs the army used the jupiter c rocket while the civiliannavy program used the vanguard rocket to launch a satellite explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 195813 the information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the earths van allen radiation belts14 the tiros1 spacecraft launched on april 1 1960 as part of nasas television infrared observation satellite tiros program sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space15 in june 1961 three and a half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the united states space surveillance network cataloged 115 earthorbiting satellites16 while canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space17 it was launched aboard an american rocket from an american spaceport the same goes for australia whose launch of the first satellite involved a donated us redstone rocket and american support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the united kingdom18 the first italian satellite san marco 1 was launched on 15 december 1964 on a us scout rocket from wallops island virginia united states with an italian launch team trained by nasa19 in similar occasions almost all further first national satellites were launched by foreign rocketscitation needed france was the third country to launch a satellite on its own rocket on 26 november 1965 the astrix or a1 initially conceptualized as fr2 or fr2 was put into orbit by a diamant a rocket launched from the ciees site at hammaguir algeria with astrix france became the sixth country to have an artificial satellite early satellites were built to unique designs with advancements in technology multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs333 geosynchronous geo communication satellite launched in 1972 beginning in 1997 freeflyer is a commercial offtheshelf software application for satellite mission analysis design and operations after the late 2010s and especially after the advent and operational fielding of large satellite internet constellationswhere onorbit active satellites more than doubled over a period of five yearsthe companies building the constellations began to propose regular planned deorbiting of the older satellites that reached the end of life as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining a launch licensecitation needed the largest artificial satellite ever is the international space station20 by the early 2000s and particularly after the advent of cubesats and increased launches of microsatsfrequently launched to the lower altitudes of low earth orbit leosatellites began to more frequently be designed to get destroyed or breakup and burnup entirely in the atmosphere21 for example spacex starlink satellites the first large satellite internet constellation to exceed 1000 active satellites on orbit in 2020 are designed to be 100 demisable and burn up completely on their atmospheric reentry at the end of their life or in the event of an early satellite failure22 in different periods many countries such as algeria argentina australia austria brazil canada chile china denmark egypt finland france germany india iran israel italy japan kazakhstan south korea malaysia mexico the netherlands norway pakistan poland russia saudi arabia south africa spain switzerland thailand turkey ukraine the united kingdom and the united states had some satellites in orbit23 japans space agency jaxa and nasa plan to send a wooden satellite prototype called lingosat into orbit in the summer of 2024 they have been working on this project for few years and sent first wood samples to the space in 2021 to test the materials resilience to space conditions24 most satellites use chemical or ion propulsion to adjust or maintain their orbit6 78 coupled with reaction wheels to control their three axis of rotation or attitude satellites close to earth are affected the most by variations in the earths magnetic gravitational field and the suns radiation pressure satellites that are further away are affected more by other bodies gravitational field by the moon and the sun satellites utilize ultrawhite reflective coatings to prevent damage from uv radiation25 without orbit and orientation control satellites in orbit will not be able to communicate with ground stations on the earth6 7576 chemical thrusters on satellites usually use monopropellant onepart or bipropellant twoparts that are hypergolic hypergolic means able to combust spontaneously when in contact with each other or to a catalyst the most commonly used propellant mixtures on satellites are hydrazinebased monopropellants or monomethylhydrazinedinitrogen tetroxide bipropellants ion thrusters on satellites usually are halleffect thrusters which generate thrust by accelerating positive ions through a negativelycharged grid ion propulsion is more efficient propellantwise than chemical propulsion but its thrust is very small around 05 n or 01 lbf and thus requires a longer burn time the thrusters usually use xenon because it is inert can be easily ionized has a high atomic mass and storable as a highpressure liquid6 7879 most satellites use solar panels to generate power and a few in deep space with limited sunlight use radioisotope thermoelectric generators slip rings attach solar panels to the satellite the slip rings can rotate to be perpendicular with the sunlight and generate the most power all satellites with a solar panel must also have batteries because sunlight is blocked inside the launch vehicle and at night the most common types of batteries for satellites are lithiumion and in the past nickelhydrogen6 8889 earth observation satellites are designed to monitor and survey the earth called remote sensing most earth observation satellites are placed in low earth orbit for a high data resolution though some are placed in a geostationary orbit for an uninterrupted coverage some satellites are placed in a sunsynchronous orbit to have consistent lighting and obtain a total view of the earth depending on the satellites functions they might have a normal camera radar lidar photometer or atmospheric instruments earth observation satellites data is most used in archaeology cartography environmental monitoring meteorology and reconnaissance applicationscitation needed as of 2021 there are over 950 earth observation satellites with the largest number of satellites operated with planet labs26 weather satellites monitor clouds city lights fires effects of pollution auroras sand and dust storms snow cover ice mapping boundaries of ocean currents energy flows etc environmental monitoring satellites can detect changes in the earths vegetation atmospheric trace gas content sea state ocean color and ice fields by monitoring vegetation changes over time droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average27 anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric no2 and so2citation needed a communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on earth communications satellites are used for television telephone radio internet and military applications28 some communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22236 miles 35785 km above the equator so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite but most form satellite constellations in low earth orbit where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently when an earth observation satellite or a communications satellite is deployed for military or intelligence purposes it is known as a spy satellite or reconnaissance satellite their uses include early missile warning nuclear explosion detection electronic reconnaissance and optical or radar imaging surveillance navigational satellites are satellites that use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with everimproving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects31 tether satellites are satellites that are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological spaceproduction and other payloads from orbit to earth biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation spacebased solar power satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on earth or other placescitation needed since the mid2000s satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks3233 for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from the earth russia united states china and india have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites34 in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite34 followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 200835 on 18 november 2015 after two failed attempts russia successfully carried out a flight test of an antisatellite missile known as nudolcitation needed on 27 march 2019 india shot down a live test satellite at 300 km altitude in 3 minutes becoming the fourth country to have the capability to destroy live satellites3637 the environmental impact of satellites is not currently well understood as they were previously assumed to be benign due to the rarity of satellite launches however the exponential increase and projected growth of satellite launches are bringing the issue into consideration the main issues are resource use and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere which can happen at different stages of a satellites lifetime resource use is difficult to monitor and quantify for satellites and launch vehicles due to their commercially sensitive nature however aluminium is a preferred metal in satellite construction due to its lightweight and relative cheapness and typically constitutes around 40 of a satellites mass38 through mining and refining aluminium has numerous negative environmental impacts and is one of the most carbonintensive metals39 satellite manufacturing also requires rare elements such as lithium gold and gallium some of which have significant environmental consequences linked to their mining and processing andor are in limited supply404142 launch vehicles require larger amounts of raw materials to manufacture and the booster stages are usually dropped into the ocean after fuel exhaustion they are not normally recovered40 two empty boosters used for ariane 5 which were composed mainly of steel weighed around 38 tons each43 to give an idea of the quantity of materials that are often left in the ocean rocket launches release numerous pollutants into every layer of the atmosphere especially affecting the atmosphere above the tropopause where the byproducts of combustion can reside for extended periods44 these pollutants can include black carbon co2 nitrogen oxides nox aluminium and water vapour but the mix of pollutants is dependent on rocket design and fuel type45 the amount of green house gases emitted by rockets is considered trivial as it contributes significantly less around 00146 than the aviation industry yearly which itself accounts for 23 of the total global greenhouse gas emissions44 rocket emissions in the stratosphere and their effects are only beginning to be studied and it is likely that the impacts will be more critical than emissions in the troposphere40 the stratosphere includes the ozone layer and pollutants emitted from rockets can contribute to ozone depletion in a number of ways radicals such as nox hox and clox deplete stratospheric o3 through intermolecular reactions and can have huge impacts in trace amounts44 however it is currently understood that launch rates would need to increase by ten times to match the impact of regulated ozonedepleting substances4748 whilst emissions of water vapour are largely deemed as inert h2o is the source gas for hox and can also contribute to ozone loss through the formation of ice particles47 black carbon particles emitted by rockets can absorb solar radiation in the stratosphere and cause warming in the surrounding air which can then impact the circulatory dynamics of the stratosphere49 both warming and changes in circulation can then cause depletion of the ozone layer several pollutants are released in the upper atmospheric layers during the orbital lifetime of leo satellites orbital decay is caused by atmospheric drag and to keep the satellite in the correct orbit the platform occasionally needs repositioning to do this nozzlebased systems use a chemical propellant to create thrust in most cases hydrazine is the chemical propellant used which then releases ammonia hydrogen and nitrogen as gas into the upper atmosphere44 also the environment of the outer atmosphere causes the degradation of exterior materials the atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere oxidises hydrocarbonbased polymers like kapton teflon and mylar that are used to insulate and protect the satellite which then emits gasses like co2 and co into the atmosphere50 given the current surge in satellites in the sky soon hundreds of satellites may be clearly visible to the human eye at dark sites it is estimated that the overall levels of diffuse brightness of the night skies has increased by up to 10 above natural levels51 this has the potential to confuse organisms like insects and nightmigrating birds that use celestial patterns for migration and orientation5253 the impact this might have is currently unclear the visibility of manmade objects in the night sky may also impact peoples linkages with the world nature and culture54 at all points of a satellites lifetime its movement and processes are monitored on the ground through a network of facilities the environmental cost of the infrastructure as well as daytoday operations is likely to be quite high40 but quantification requires further investigation particular threats arise from uncontrolled deorbit some notable satellite failures that polluted and dispersed radioactive materials are kosmos 954 kosmos 1402 and the transit 5bn3 when in a controlled manner satellites reach the end of life they are intentionally deorbited or moved to a graveyard orbit further away from earth in order to reduce space debris physical collection or removal is not economical or even currently possible moving satellites out to a graveyard orbit is also unsustainable because they remain there for hundreds of years40 it will lead to the further pollution of space and future issues with space debris when satellites deorbit much of it is destroyed during reentry into the atmosphere due to the heat this introduces more material and pollutants into the atmosphere3855 there have been concerns expressed about the potential damage to the ozone layer and the possibility of increasing the earths albedo reducing warming but also resulting in accidental geoengineering of the earths climate40 after deorbiting 70 of satellites end up in the ocean and are rarely recovered44 using wood as an alternative material has been posited in order to reduce pollution and debris from satellites that reenter the atmosphere56 space debris pose dangers to the spacecraft5859 including satellites5960 in or crossing geocentric orbits and have the potential to drive a kessler syndrome61 which could potentially curtail humanity from conducting space endeavors in the future6263 with increase in the number of satellite constellations like spacex starlink the astronomical community such as the iau report that orbital pollution is getting increased significantly6465666768 a report from the satcon1 workshop in 2020 concluded that the effects of large satellite constellations can severely affect some astronomical research efforts and lists six ways to mitigate harm to astronomy6970 the iau is establishing a center cps to coordinate or aggregate measures to mitigate such detrimental effects717273 due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by landbased transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitters range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming7475 but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming7677 also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellites transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dualilluminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring tools and methods that enable them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively citation needed issues like space debris radio and light pollution are increasing in magnitude and at the same time lack progress in national or international regulation7857 generally liability has been covered by the liability convention the operation capabilities and use have very much diversified and is broadening increasingly satellite operation needs not only access to financial manufacturing and launch capabilities but also a ground segment infrastructure a list of selected earth satellites with a high mass is given excluded are crewed satellites ie space stations and launch vehicles and satellites not intended for longterm earth orbit such as missions to beyond earth orbit included are satellites at sunearth lagrange point 2 16000 kg 35274 lb lacrosse
