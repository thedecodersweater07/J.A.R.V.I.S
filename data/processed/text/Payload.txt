payload is the object or the entity that is being carried by an aircraft or launch vehicle sometimes payload also refers to the carrying capacity of an aircraft or launch vehicle usually measured in terms of weight depending on the nature of the flight or mission the payload of a vehicle may include cargo passengers flight crew munitions scientific instruments or experiments or other equipment extra fuel when optionally carried is also considered part of the payload1 in a commercial context ie an airline or air freight carrier payload may refer only to revenuegenerating cargo or paying passengers2 a payload of ordnance carried by a combat aircraft is sometimes alternatively referred to as the aircrafts warload for a rocket the payload can be a satellite space probe or spacecraft carrying humans animals or cargo for a ballistic missile the payload is one or more warheads and related systems their total weight is referred to as the throwweight the fraction of payload to the total liftoff weight of the air or spacecraft is known as the payload fraction when the weight of the payload and fuel are considered together it is known as the useful load fraction in spacecraft mass fraction is normally used which is the ratio of payload to everything else including the rocket structure3 there is a natural tradeoff between the payload and the range of an aircraft a payload range diagram also known as the elbow chart illustrates the tradeoff the top horizontal line represents the maximum payload it is limited structurally by maximum zerofuel weight mzfw of the aircraft maximum payload is the difference between maximum zerofuel weight and operational empty weight oew moving lefttoright along the line shows the constant maximum payload as the range increases more fuel needs to be added for more range the vertical line represents the range at which the combined weight of the aircraft maximum payload and needed fuel reaches the maximum takeoff weight mtow of the aircraft if the range is increased beyond that point payload has to be sacrificed for fuel the maximum takeoff weight is limited by a combination of the maximum net power of the engines and the liftdrag ratio of the wings the diagonal line after the rangeatmaximumpayload point shows how reducing the payload allows increasing the fuel and range when taking off with the maximum takeoff weight the second kink in the curve represents the point at which the maximum fuel capacity is reached flying further than that point means that the payload has to be reduced further for an even lesser increase in range the absolute range is thus the range at which an aircraft can fly with maximum possible fuel without carrying any payload examples of payload capacity for aircraft the weight of fuel in wing tanks does not contribute as significantly to the bending moment of the wing as does weight in the fuselage so even when the airplane has been loaded with its maximum payload that the wings can support it can still carry a significant amount of fuel launch and transport system differ not only on the payload that can be carried but also in the stresses and other factors placed on the payload the payload must not only be lifted to its target it must also arrive safely whether elsewhere on the surface of the earth or a specific orbit to ensure this the payload such as a warhead or satellite is designed to withstand certain amounts of various types of punishment on the way to its destination most rocket payloads are fitted within a payload fairing to protect them against dynamic pressure of highvelocity travel through the atmosphere and to improve the overall aerodynamics of the launch vehicle most aircraft payloads are carried within the fuselage for similar reasons outsize cargo may require a fuselage with unusual proportions such as the super guppy the various constraints placed on the launch system can be roughly categorized into those that cause physical damage to the payload and those that can damage its electronic or chemical makeup examples of physical damage include extreme accelerations over short time scales caused by atmospheric buffeting or oscillations extreme accelerations over longer time scales caused by rocket thrust and gravity and sudden changes in the magnitude or direction of the acceleration caused by how quick engines are throttled and shut down etc electrical chemical or biological payloads can be damaged by extreme temperatures hot or cold rapid changes in temperature or pressure contact with fast moving air streams causing ionization and radiation exposure from cosmic rays the van allen belt or solar wind
