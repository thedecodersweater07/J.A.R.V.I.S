19151112 he accepted the position at the following months board meeting and his presidency was made effective june 1 19151314 he inherited a college with declining enrollment centre historian william weston wrote that this was partially as a result of decisions made by ganfields predecessor frederick w hinitt to sever formal ties with the presbyterian church in the united states of america pcusa the northern presbyterian church for the first time15 those changes were made to gain central admittance into the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching which required member schools be nonsectarian in 190816 many of ganfields major decisions worked to reverse this to get the schools enrollment and endowment back up he conducted a fundraiser which was planned for completion in 1919 in time for the colleges centennial though it was not finished until afterward by 1922 the total amount raised had reached 400000 equivalent to 7510000 in 2024 and had raised the schools endowment past 1 million for the first time3 gradually the schools ties to the church were reinstated it received funding for teaching of the bible from the board of education of the pcusa in 1919 before fully reinstating the church connection in 1921 this change was not without opposition especially from some of the younger members of the schools board of trustees but the change went further in specifying that future presidents of the school would be required to be presbyterian17b almost immediately enrollment rebounded from a low of 80 students in 191515 the school hit 287 in 1921 the first year after church ties were reinstated20 another change took place when the school reverted to the centre college name on december 17 191821 it had used the name central university of kentucky since its merger with central university of richmond kentucky in 190122 sports particularly american football were emphasized during ganfields time at centre the praying colonels football team was experiencing national prominence ganfield recruited charley moran to take over as head coach starting in 1917 and the hiring of texas high school football coach robert l myers as athletic director meant that his star players bo mcmillin red weaver and red roberts joined him in danville as members of the football team23 the team saw success almost immediately the 1917 squad lost only one game the 1918 team went undefeated in a flushortened season and the 1919 team finished undefeatedallowing no more than seven points in any gameand were retroactively recognized as national champions by the sagarin ratings242526 the teams success and fame peaked as a result of their october 29 1921 victory over harvard generally viewed as one of the largest upsets in college football history272829 this athletic success came around the same time as declining academic standards centre was dropped from the association of colleges and secondary schools of southern states in 1920 and was not restored until 192330 ganfield took the presidency of carroll college effective december 1 19213132 he had been carrolls first choice to replace wilbur oscar carrier when he resigned the presidency in 1917 but ganfield declined because he was less than two years into his term at central33 despite this he was not carrolls first choice this time he was offered the job after george mccune a pastor from new york declined it ganfields return to carroll restored a minister to their presidency as his predecessor herbert pierpont houghton had been the schools first lay president34 ganfield had accepted the presidency earlier that year but his new contract dictated that he would not leave centre until after the harvard game3132 at carroll ganfield worked to restore carrolls christian identity and reintegrated religion as a key part of the student experience35 throughout his term daily chapel attendance was upheld as a requirement for all students and church attendance remained a requirement for faculty members36 shortly after returning to carroll ganfield entered the republican primary for wisconsins class 1 us senate seat being contested in the 1922 elections37 he was defeated by incumbent senator robert m la follette after earning 278 of the vote to la follettes 72238 la follette went on to win the general election in a landslide over the democratic candidate jessie jack hooper39 that same year ganfield was elected moderator of the presbyterian synod of wisconsin9 he remained involved in politics and was part of wendell willkies platform committee during his run for president of the united states in 194040 as part of an effort to raise funds and increase carrolls endowment ganfield sought to increase emphasis on athletics in a similar fashion as had been done at centre41 a new gymnasium was constructed at carroll starting in 1923 though a collapse of the steel framework that november delayed its completion42 its dedication was scheduled for june 12 192443 he predicted that the schools football team would be beating the team from the university of wisconsinmadison within a few years though this game ultimately never happened44 in 1923 norris armstrong a

armstrong also coached the carroll basketball team to wiaa titles in 1924 1925 and 19274546 pensions a fixed salary scale and tenure for faculty members were major issues during ganfields administration especially against the backdrop of growing faculty numbers47 the school had been operating on a system by which faculty members negotiated their salaries individually which ganfield saw as unsatisfactory for both the faculty and the college48 the salary scale was established in 1928 with the maximum salary for a full professor set at 3200 equivalent to 59000 in 2024 per year solutions to the pension and tenure problems were addressed during the great depression and both in part because of specific incidents with faculty members the former was resolved in 1937 as a result of government regulation following a 1930 dispute between the board of trustees and a longtime member of the faculty and the tenure issue was resolved owing to an incident in which a professor was relegated to a nonteaching role against his will49 greek life was prominent at carroll during ganfields tenure the school hosted four fraternities phi theta pi beta pi epsilon tau kappa epsilon and gamma phi delta and four sororities beta chi theta kappa gamma phi theta pi delta and alpha kappa40 by 1927 the schools endowment had reached upwards of 650000 equivalent to 118 million in 2024 and

of the womens dormitory50 during the great depression ganfield wore a red tie during years where the school was in debt in the red and a black tie when the school ran a budget surplus in the black51 despite the economic hardship nationwide carroll experienced relative prosperity during this time with tuition costs at 200 equivalent to 5000 in 2024 per student the college finished with surpluses on multiple occasions received a record number of applications and maintained steady enrollment52 by the time of ganfields resignation the endowment had reached 800000 equivalent to 181 million in 202453 carrolls enrollment had reached 500 students by 1935 and that academic year also saw faculty salaries receive a slight increase54 by the end of his term the school had 33 faculty members and a requirement that they must earn a masters degree55 despite these standards carrolls effort to establish a chapter of the phi beta kappa honor society was rejected in 193556 ganfield retired effective july 1 19399 due to poor health53 gerrit t vander lugt a member of the carroll faculty was chosen to replace ganfield as acting president and was later elevated to the full position becoming ganfields
