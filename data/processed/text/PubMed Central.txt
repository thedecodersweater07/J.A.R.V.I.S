pubmed central pmc is a free digital repository that archives open access fulltext scholarly articles that have been published in biomedical and life sciences journals as one of the major research databases developed by the national center for biotechnology information ncbi pubmed central is more than a document repository submissions to pmc are indexed and formatted for enhanced metadata medical ontology and unique identifiers which enrich the xml structured data for each article1 content within pmc can be linked to other ncbi databases and accessed via entrez search and retrieval systems further enhancing the publics ability to discover read and build upon its biomedical knowledge2 pubmed central is distinct from pubmed3 pubmed central is a free digital archive of full articles accessible to anyone from anywhere via a web browser with varying provisions for reuse conversely although pubmed is a searchable database of biomedical citations and abstracts the fulltext article resides elsewhere in print or online free or behind a subscriber paywall pubmed central began as ebiomed initially proposed in may 1999 by thennih director harold varmus4 the idea came to him abruptly in december 1998 inspired by the early use of arxiv for preprints after a presentation from pat brown of stanford and david lipman director of ncbi56 but my views broadened abruptly one morning in december of 1998 when i met pat brown for coffee at the caf that was formerly the famed tassajara bakery on the corner of cole and parnassus during a visit to san francisco a few weeks before our coffee pat had learned about the methods being used by the physicist paul ginsparg and his colleagues at los alamos to allow physicists and mathematicians to share their work with one another over the internet they were posting preprints articles not yet submitted or accepted for publication at a publicly accessible website called lanx or arxiv for anyone to read and critique the more i thought about this the more i was convinced that a radical restructuring of methods for publishing transmitting storing and using biomedical research reports might be possible and beneficial in a spirit of enthusiasm and political innocence i wrote a lengthy manifesto proposing the creation of an nihsupported online system called ebiomed the goal of ebiomed was to provide free access to all biomedical research papers submitted to ebiomed could take one of two routes either immediately published as a preprint or through a traditional peer review process the peer review process was to resemble contemporary overlay journals with an external editorial board retaining control over the process of reviewing curating and listing papers which would otherwise be freely accessible on the central ebiomed server varmus intended to realize the new possibilities presented by communicating scientific results digitally imagining continuous conversation about published work versioned documents and enriched layered formats allowing for multiple levels of detail4 the proposal to create a central index of biomedical research was a radical departure from prevailing publishing norms prior to the internet publication indexes operated largely like isbns allocated by registration agencies to secondary publishers the idea that anyone could own their own address space via a domain name and create their own indexing system was a wholly new idea78 major commercial publishers had begun experimenting with an indexing system for scientific papers shared across publishers as early as 1993 and were spurred to action following the ebiomed proposal at the october 1999 stm annual frankfurt conference several publishers led by springerverlag reached a hurried conference room consensus to launch their competitor prototype9 at the board meeting of the stm association held the afternoon of monday october 11 before the fairs wednesday opening discussion focused on an emerging us national library of medicine nlm initiative called ebiomed later pubmed central that had been proposed by harold varmus of the national institutes of health in the spring of 1999 varmus envisioned a digital archive of journals accessible free of charge and with the added value of reference linking our consensus was that publishers should be the ones doing the linking said bob campbell who chaired the meeting since we were higher up the stream so to speak we should be able to link our articles ahead of the nlm as part of the process of producing them stefan von holtzbrinck then set the ball rolling by offering to link nature publications with anyone elses we decided to issue an announcement of a broad stm reference linking initiative it was of course a strategic move only since we had neither plan nor prototype a small group led by arnoud de kemp of springerverlag met in an adjacent room immediately following the board meeting to draft the announcement which was distributed to all attendees of the stm annual meeting the following day and published in an stm membership publication the potential benefit of the service that would become crossref was immediately apparent organizations such as aip and iop institute of physics had begun to link to each others publications and the impossibility of replicating such oneoff arrangements across the industry was obvious as tim ingoldsby later put it all those linking agreements were going to kill us under pressure from vigorous lobbying from commercial publishers and scientific societies who feared for lost profits10 nih officials announced a revised pubmed central proposal in august 19995 pmc would receive submissions from publishers rather than from authors as in ebiomed publications were allowed timeembargoed paywalls up to one year pmc would only allow peerreviewed work no preprints11 the thenunnamed publisherled linking system shortly thereafter became crossref and the larger doi system varmus brown and others including michael eisen went on to found the public library of science plos in 2001 reaching the conclusion that if we really want to change the publication of scientific research we must do the publishing ourselves12 launched in february 2000 the repository has grown rapidly as the nih public access policy is designed to make all research funded by the national institutes of health nih freely accessible to anyone and in addition many publishers are working cooperatively with the nih to provide free access to their workscitation needed in late 2007 the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 hr 2764 was signed into law and included a provision requiring the nih to modify its policies and require inclusion into pubmed central complete electronic copies of their peerreviewed research and findings from nihfunded research these articles are required to be included within 12 months of publication this is the first time the us government has required an agency to provide open access to research and is an evolution from the 2005 policy in which the nih asked researchers to voluntarily add their research to pubmed central13 a uk version of the pubmed central system uk pubmed central ukpmc has been developed by the wellcome trust and the british library as part of a ninestrong group of uk research funders this system went live in january 2007 on 1 november 2012 it became europe pubmed central the canadian member of the pubmed central international network pubmed central canada was launched in october 2009 the national library of medicine nlm journal publishing tag set journal article markup language is freely available14 the association of learned and professional society publishers comments that it is likely to become the standard for preparing scholarly content for both books and journals15 a related dtd is available for books16 the library of congress and the british library have announced support for the nlm dtd17 it has also been popular with journal service providers18 with the release of public access plans for many agencies beyond nih pmc is in the process of becoming the repository for a wider variety of articles19 this includes nasa content with the interface branded as pubspace2021 as of december 2018update the pmc archive contained over 52 million articles22 with contributions coming from publishers or authors depositing their manuscripts into the repository per the nih public access policy earlier data shows that from january 2013 to january 2014 authorinitiated deposits exceeded 103000 papers during a 12month period23 pmc identifies about 4000 journals which participate in some capacity to deposit their published content into the pmc repository24 some publishers delay the release of their articles on pubmed central for a set time after publication referred to as an embargo period ranging from a few months to a few years depending on the journal embargoes of six to twelve months are the most common pubmed central is a key example of systematic external distribution by a third party25 which some publishers purport to prohibit through private contractscitation needed articles are sent to pubmed central by publishers in xml or sgml using a variety of article dtds older and larger publishers may have their own established inhouse dtds but many publishers use the nlm journal publishing dtd see above received articles are converted via xslt to the very similar nlm archiving and interchange dtd this process may reveal errors that are reported back to the publisher for correction graphics are also converted to standard formats and sizes the original and converted forms are archived the converted form is moved into a relational database along with associated files for graphics multimedia or other associated data many publishers also provide pdf of their articles and these are made available without change26 bibliographic citations are parsed and automatically linked to the relevant abstracts in pubmed articles in pubmed central and resources on publishers web sites pubmed links also lead to pubmed central unresolvable references such as to journals or particular articles not yet available at one of these sources are tracked in the database and automatically come live when the resources become available an inhouse indexing system provides search capability and is aware of biological and medical terminology such as generic vs proprietary drug names and alternate names for organisms diseases and anatomical parts when a user accesses a journal issue a table of contents is automatically generated by retrieving all articles letters editorials etc for that issue when an actual item such as an article is reached pubmed central converts the nlm markup to html for delivery and provides links to related data objects this is feasible because the variety of incoming data has first been converted to standard dtds and graphic formats in a separate submission stream nihfunded authors may deposit articles into pubmed central using the nih manuscript submission nihms articles thus submitted typically go through xml markup in order to be converted to nlm dtd reactions to pubmed central among the scholarly publishing community range between a genuine enthusiasm by some27 to cautious concern by others28 while pmc is a welcome partner to open access publishers in its ability to augment the discovery and dissemination of biomedical knowledge that same truth causes others to worry about traffic being diverted from the published version of record the economic consequences of less readership as well as the effect on maintaining a community of scholars within learned societies2930 a 2013 analysis found strong evidence that public repositories of published articles were responsible for drawing significant numbers of readers away from journal websites and that the effect of pmc is growing over time30 libraries universities open access supporters consumer health advocacy groups and patient rights organizations have applauded pubmed central and hope to see similar public access repositories developed by other federal funding agencies so to freely share any research publications that were the result of taxpayer support31 the antelman study of open access publishing found that in philosophy political science electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics open access papers had a greater research impact32 a randomised trial found an increase in content downloads of open access papers with no citation advantage over subscription access one year after publication33 the nih policy and open access repository work has inspired a 2013 presidential directive which has sparked action in other federal agencies as well in march 2020 pubmed central accelerated its deposit procedures for the full text of publications on coronavirus the nlm did so upon request from the white house office of science and technology policy and international scientists to improve access for scientists healthcare providers data mining innovators ai healthcare researchers and the general public34 the pmcid pubmed central identifier also known as the pmc reference number is a bibliographic identifier for the pubmed central open access database much like the pmid is the bibliographic identifier for the pubmed database the two identifiers are distinct however it consists of pmc followed by a string of numbers the format is35 authors applying for nih awards must include the pmcid in their applicationcitation needed
