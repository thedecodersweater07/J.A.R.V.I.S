a low earth orbit leo is an orbit around earth with a period of 128 minutes or less making at least 1125 orbits per day and an eccentricity less than 0251 most of the artificial objects in outer space are in leo peaking in number at an altitude around 800 km 500 mi2 while the farthest in leo before medium earth orbit meo have an altitude of 2000 kilometers about onethird of the radius of earth and near the beginning of the inner van allen radiation belt the term leo region is used for the area of space below an altitude of 2000 km 1200 mi about onethird of earths radius3 objects in orbits that pass through this zone even if they have an apogee further out or are suborbital are carefully tracked since they present a collision risk to the many leo satellites no human spaceflights other than the lunar missions of the apollo program 19681972 have gone beyond leo artemis ii is also planned to go beyond leo in early 20264 all space stations to date have operated geocentric within leo a wide variety of sources567 define leo in terms of altitude the altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit even for circular orbits the altitude above ground can vary by as much as 30 km 19 mi especially for polar orbits due to the oblateness of earths spheroid figure and local topography while definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because according to keplers third law this corresponds to a semimajor axis of 8413 km 5228 mi for circular orbits this in turn corresponds to an altitude of 2042 km 1269 mi above the mean radius of earth which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some leo definitions the leo region is defined by some sources as a region in space that leo orbits occupy389 some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the leo region near their lowest altitude or perigee but are not in a leo orbit because their highest altitude or apogee exceeds 2000 km 1243 mi suborbital objects can also reach the leo region but are not in a leo orbit because they reenter the atmosphere the distinction between leo orbits and the leo region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in leo but could collide with satellites or debris in leo orbits the mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low earth orbit is about 78 kms 48 mis which translates to 28000 kmh 17000 mph however this depends on the exact altitude of the orbit calculated for a circular orbit of 200 km 120 mi the orbital velocity is 779 kms 484 mis but for a higher 1500 km 930 mi orbit the velocity is reduced to 712 kms 442 mis10 the launch vehicles deltav needed to achieve low earth orbit starts around 94 kms 58 mis the pull of gravity in leo is only slightly less than on the earths surface this is because the distance to leo from the earths surface is much less than the earths radius however an object in orbit is in a permanent free fall around earth because in orbit the gravitational force and the centrifugal force balance each other outa as a result spacecraft in orbit continue to stay in orbit and people inside or outside such craft continuously experience weightlessness objects in leo orbit earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner van allen radiation belt they encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere approximately 80600 km above the surface or exosphere approximately 600 km or 400 mi and higher depending on orbit height satellites in orbits that reach altitudes below 300 km 190 mi decay quickly due to atmospheric drag equatorial low earth orbits eleo are a subset of leo these orbits with low orbital inclination allow rapid revisit times over lowlatitude locations on earth prograde equatorial leos also have lower deltav launch requirements because they take advantage of the earths rotation other useful leo orbits including polar orbits and sunsynchronous orbits have a higher inclinations to the equator and provide coverage for higher latitudes on earth some of the first generation of starlink satellites used polar orbits which provide coverage everywhere on earth later starlink constellations orbit at a lower inclination and provide more coverage for populated areas higher orbits include medium earth orbit meo sometimes called intermediate circular orbit ico and further above geostationary orbit geo orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation in 2017 very low earth orbits vleo began to be seen in regulatory filings these orbits below about 450 km 280 mi require the use of novel technologies for orbit raising because they operate in orbits that would ordinarily decay too soon to be economically useful1112 a low earth orbit requires the lowest amount of energy for satellite placement it provides high bandwidth and low communication latency satellites and space stations in leo are more accessible for crew and servicing since it requires less energy to place a satellite into a leo and a satellite there needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission leo is used for many communication applications such as the iridium phone system some communication satellites use much higher geostationary orbits and move at the same angular velocity as the earth as to appear stationary above one location on the planet unlike geosynchronous satellites satellites in low orbit have a small field of view and can only observe and communicate with a fraction of the earth at a given time this means that a large network or constellation of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage satellites at lower altitudes of orbit are in the atmosphere and suffer from rapid orbital decay requiring either periodic reboosting to maintain stable orbits or the launching of replacements for those that reenter the atmosphere the effects of adding such quantities of vaporized metals to earths stratosphere are potentially of concern but currently unknown13 the leo environment is becoming congested with space debris because of the frequency of object launches18 this has caused growing concern in recent years since collisions at orbital velocities can be dangerous or deadly collisions can produce additional space debris creating a domino effect known as kessler syndrome nasas orbital debris program tracks over 25000 objects larger than 10 cm diameter in leo while the estimated number between 1 and 10 cm is 500000 and the number of particles bigger than 1 mm exceeds 100 million19 the particles travel at speeds up to 78 kms 28000 kmh 17500 mph so even a small impact can severely damage a spacecraft20 this article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the national aeronautics and space administration
