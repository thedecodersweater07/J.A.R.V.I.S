nicknamed the frenchman he represented both philadelphia franchises and the cleveland bronchos which was renamed the naps by fans after him and which he led as its playermanager from 1905 through 1909 lajoie was signed to the philadelphia phillies of the national league nl in 1896 by the beginning of the 20th century however the upstart american league al was looking to rival the supremacy of the nl and in 1901 lajoie and dozens of former national league players joined the american league national league clubs contested the legality of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but lajoie was eventually allowed to play for connie macks philadelphia athletics during the season lajoie set the alltime american league singleseason mark for the highest batting average 426123selfpublished source p76 4 p88 one year later lajoie went to the cleveland bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when he returned to play for mack and the athletics while with cleveland lajoies popularity led to locals electing to change the clubs team name from bronchos to napoleons naps for short which remained until after lajoie departed cleveland and the name was changed to indians the teams name until 2021 lajoie led the al in batting average five times in his career and four times recorded the highest number of hits during several of those years with the naps he and ty cobb dominated al hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other most notably in 1910 when the leagues batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by american league president ban johnson in 1914 lajoie became the third major league player to accumulate 3000 career hits joining cap anson and honus wagner he led the nl or al in putouts five times in his career and in assists three times he has been called the best second baseman in the history of baseball and the most outstanding player to wear a cleveland uniform5 p207 6 cy young said lajoie was one of the most rugged players i ever faced hed take your leg off with a line drive turn the third baseman around like a swinging door and powder the hand of the left fielder4 p86 in 1937 lajoie was elected to the national baseball hall of fame lajoie was born on september 5 1874 in woonsocket rhode island to jeanbaptiste and clina guertin lajoie jeanbaptiste lajoie was frenchcanadian and had immigrated to the united states upon arrival to the us he first settled in rutland vermont but then moved to woonsocket where nap the youngest of eight surviving children was born7 throughout his childhood lajoie received little formal education8 jean who worked as a teamster and laborer died not long into lajoies childhood which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family9 p39 lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill he also began playing semiprofessional baseball for the local woonsocket team under the alias sandy because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball he earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called slugging cabby4 p88 9 p40 when i told my father i had decided to take the job he was very angry he shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them but i was determined to give it a try at least one season lajoie later said10 he also received the nickname larry from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing lajoie10 lajoie admired baseball players such as king kelly and charles radbourn11 p179 when word of lajoies baseball ability spread he began to play for other semiprofessional teams at 2 to 5 per game 76 to 189 in current dollar terms he also worked as a teamster7 he left woonsocket and his 750 per week 283 in current dollar terms job as a taxi driver and joined the class b new england leagues fall river indians in 1896 lajoie played as a center fielder first baseman and catcher earning 25 weekly 945 in current dollar terms9 p40 12 p19 he recorded 163 hits in 80 games and led the team in batting average doubles triples home runs and hits13 lajoie was widely regarded as an outstanding prospect and indians owner charlie marston rejected an offer from the pittsburgh pirates to purchase lajoies contract for 500 18898 in current dollar terms he was also scouted by the philadelphia phillies and boston beaneaters12 p19 the philadelphia phillies of the mlbs national league nl purchased lajoie and teammate phil geier from fall river for 1500 56694 in current dollar terms on august 9 while some accounts claim that phillies manager billy nash originally went to fall river intending only to sign geier but obtained lajoie when the team agreed to include him in their asking price1415 p55 others dispute that claim author david jordan wrote a legend later grew up that geier was the main target of nashs pursuit and that marston threw in lajoie in order to get the phillies to pay the 1500 asking price this is hardly likely while geier was considered a good prospect lajoie was banging the ball at a 429 clip in his first professional season was a fine fielder and had already been sought by several big league clubs nap lajoie clearly represented a financial asset to marston who did not give him away the price the phillies paid was a substantial sum for two minor leaguers in 189612 p19 lajoie made his major league debut on august 12 1896 against the washington senators of the national league he played first base and recorded a single12 p19 ed delahanty was being considered to play the first base position after dan brouthers retired delahanty however wanted lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field delahanty said to lajoie look sonny you tell the boss youre a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along10 lajoie became the teams first baseman and by the end of the season he and delahanty were roommates later in 1898 new manager george stallings moved lajoie to second base commenting lajoie would have made good no matter where i positioned him7 lajoie hit 363 and led the nl in slugging percentage in 1897 and doubles and rbis in 189812 p20 1617 he had a 378 batting average in 1899 though he played only 77 games due to an injury1 in 1900 he missed five weeks due to a broken thumb suffered in a fistfight with teammate elmer flick718 in april 1900 brooklyn manager ned hanlon made a public offer of 10000 to purchase lajoie from the phillies who rebuffed the offer19 john rogers described as a pennypinching majority owner of the phillies assured lajoie that he would make the same salary as delahanty20 however lajoie discovered that while he was earning 2600 98270 in current dollar terms delahanty earned 3000 113388 in current dollar terms contracts for nl players were not allowed to surpass 24004 p88 21 p16 rogers increased lajoies pay by 200 but the damage had already been done because i felt i had been cheated i was determined to listen to any reasonable american league offer lajoie said22 p96 in 1901 the newly created american league had attracted several of the national leagues top players to join its ranks rogers declined lajoies request for an increase in salary and as a result lajoie jumped to the crosstown philadelphia athletics owned by former phillies partowner benjamin shibe and managed by connie mack7 frank hough offered lajoie the contract on behalf of mack hough offered me 24000 907104 in current dollar terms for four years you can bet i signed in a hurry lajoie said22 p97 lajoie was considered the first superstar to join the newly formed al he was also the first player whose yearly salary was 4000 151184 in current dollar terms4 p88 11 p180 23 p42 the phillies opened their season and drew 6000 fans a week later when we opened there were 16000 in the stands the american league was here to stay lajoie later said10 lajoies batting average that year was 426 due to a transcription error that was not discovered until 1954 which inaccurately gave his hit total as 220 instead of 229 it was originally recorded at 405 it was later changed to 422 before finally being revised again to 42623 p76 4 p88 the batting average mark became the alltime al record after the number was revised eclipsing ty cobb and george sisler who had been credited with having the als alltime mark24 that same year in a game against the chicago white soxs clark griffith lajoie became the second major leaguer after abner dalrymple in 1881 to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game11 p179 for the 1901 season lajoie led the majors in doubles 48 hits 232 batting average 426 runs 145 onbase 463 and slugging percentage 643 and total bases 350 his 125 rbis led the al and his 14 home runs were a careerbest while his 48 doubles are a philadelphia athletics record125selfpublished source p341 mack said of lajoie he plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort7 author robert kelly writes the 422 sic batting average of lajoie still stands as an al record to some degree however it is tainted the 1901 season was the first for the al and the level of competition was presumably evolving such questions however in no way cast doubt on the extraordinary batting ability of the second baseman26 in april 1902 the supreme court of pennsylvania overruled an earlier decision by the court of common pleas and upheld the reserve clause in contracts between players and nl clubs president of the chicago national league club jim hart said the state supreme courts decision had dealt a fatal blow to the rival league and nl clubs have won a great victory27 the phillies rogers obtained an injunction barring lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than his team28 however a lawyer discovered that the injunction was enforceable only in the state of pennsylvania the courts ruled that the reserve clause was not valid for players who signed with an al team29 mack responded by trading lajoie and bill bernhard to the thenmoribund cleveland bronchos whose owner charles somers had provided considerable financial assistance to the as in the early years303132 p36 lajoie was also pursued by charles comiskey owner of the chicago white sox33 lajoie nicknamed the frenchman and considered baseballs most famous player at the time arrived in cleveland on june 4 his play was immediately met with approval from fans9 p41 15 p55 25 p17 the bronchos drew 10000 fans to league park in lajoies first game5 p12 10 the bronchos record at the time lajoie and bill bernhard lajoies fellow athletics teammate joined was 1124 and improved to 1224 after the teams inaugural game with their new players a 43 win over the boston americans5 p13 34 the team went on to finish 6967 fifth in the al for the franchises first winning record since the al began as a league3536 after his first season with the bronchos lajoies 378 average led all al players37 new york giants manager john mcgraw was rumored to want to sign lajoie but lajoie said i intend to stick to cleveland38 for the remainder of 1902 and most of 1903 lajoie bernhard and elmer flick traveled separately from the rest of the team needing to avoid entering pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena as the only team they could legally play with inside state limits was the nls phillies when the team went to play in philadelphia lajoie and bernhard would go to nearby atlantic city to help pass the time32 p36 the issue was finally resolved when the leagues made peace through the national agreement in september 1903 which also brought the formation of the world series5 p13 9 p40 to begin the 1903 season the club changed its name from the bronchos to the naps in honor of lajoie after a readers poll result was released by the cleveland press5 p13 the team was officially the blues in their inaugural al season but changed to the bronchos for the 1902 season36 the naps finished the season 7763 and lajoie finished his first full season with the club as once again the als batting champion with a 344 average36 he also led the league in slugging percentage 518 finished second in doubles 41 third in rbis 93 and tied for fifth in home runs 739 in the offseason he contracted pleurisy10 during the 1904 season lajoie received a suspension after he spat tobacco juice in an umpires eye9 p41 he later informally replaced bill armour as the teams manager armour submitted his resignation on september 9 but as team captain lajoie had already been acting as the naps field manager after the season had concluded lajoie was officially named manager5 p14 he still managed to lead the majors with a 376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive league batting title1 he also led the majors in hits 208 doubles 49 rbis 102 and slugging percentage 5461 lajoie prohibited his players from playing cards and gambling during the regular season23 p107 as a manager lajoie was also described as much too lenient with his players22 p98 lajoie contracted sepsis from an untreated spike injury after a game in july 190532 p63 dye from lajoies stockings entered his bloodstream and led to blood poisoning40 p48 a rule was put into place requiring white socks to be worn underneath a players colored socks41 p339 the injury worsened and lajoie eventually came to games in a wheelchair and doctors considered amputation21 p32 the injury and illness kept lajoie out until august 28 when he returned as the teams first baseman near the end of the season he sustained an injury to his ankle from a foul tip during an at bat and did not play for the remainder of the season but continued to manage from the bench5 p14 he finished the season having only appeared in 65 games a careerlow other than his rookie season when he was not called up until well after the season had begun1 the naps finished with a 7678 record in a season in which they had been 5229 and held a threegame lead in the american league on july 2436 baseball historian bill james wrote of lajoies higherthannormal career putout total and importance to cleveland nap lajoie was not only the teams superstar after 1905 he was also the manager he was more than thathell the team was actually called the naps in his honor as if lajoie was the team if lajoie was in the habit of covering second base every play the shortstop certainly wasnt going to tell him not to42 p489 lajoie led the majors in 1906 in hits 214 and doubles 48 and the naps finished third in the al again with a winning record 8964143 lajoie finished second in the al to george stone in batting average slugging and onbase percentage44 in 1906 he married myrtle smith and the couple moved to a small farm outside cleveland9 p41 in june of the 1907 season lajoies 296 average an average even now that scores of players would be glad to accept45 put him at risk for hitting below 300 for the first time in his career he also missed 15 games due to a recurrence of sepsis5 p15 lajoie and naps first baseman george stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and stovall broke a chair over lajoies head george didnt mean anything by it lajoie said and the two maintained a working relationship15 p57 22 p98 he finished the season with an average of 3011 naps owner charles somers received a trade offer from the detroit tigers for flick and the tigers ty cobb tigers manager hughie jennings called somers and told him he was offering the trade because cobb was not getting along with several teammates somers decided to retain flick saying well keep flick maybe he isnt as good a batter as cobb but hes much nicer to have on the team5 p16 the naps finished the regular season in second place to the tigers with a 9064 record a halfgame behind the tigers who finished 9063 and were not forced to make up a rainedout game in accordance with league rules5 p16 lajoie was partly blamed for the naps secondplace finish author fred mcmane described an instance during the season between naps catcher nig clarke and lajoie clarke was newly married and asked lajoie for a day off so that he could go home lajoie refused clarke sulked and walked over to warm up pitcher addie joss on the first pitch he stuck out a finger and the ball broke it cleanly with blood streaming from his hand clarke waved it defiantly in front of lajoie now can i go home asked clarke he was out five weeks and cleveland lost the pennant to detroit by half a game22 p9899 lajoie finished the season tied for thirdmost in hits 168 while cobbs batting average slugging and onbase percentages and hit total led the american league46 baseball historians have suggested the managerial duties lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers23 p42 lajoies dissatisfaction with the naps play worsened you cant win in the major leagues unless you have players who know the game we dont have time to teach and train youngsters up here our job is to win pennants not run schools he said40 p65 franklin lewis sports writer and author wrote lajoie in spite of his marvelous fielding and tremendous batting was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager40 p52 lajoie recommended to somers on august 17 1909 he find the team a new manager although he wanted to remain on the club as a player somers responded to lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision somers acted quickly to find a replacement promoting naps coach deacon jim mcguire to manager5 p17 lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a playermanager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play10 the highestpaid player in the league he also offered a 10000 349963 in current dollar terms reduction in salary the team finished 7182 while lajoies 324 average was third in the al and 33 doubles second47 the naps finished 1910 7181 but lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a 384 averagea and 227 hits both categories bettered only in lajoies 1901 campaign4849 his 51 doubles a careerhigh and 304 total bases led the majors the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category1 lajoie missed significant parts of backtoback seasons the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games150 stovall the former naps first baseman replaced mcguire as the clubs manager and the naps finished 80735 p19 lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in may during a practice session in chicago51 he played in 117 games on the season an increase over the 90 he played in one season before but cleveland who had hired joe birmingham as the teams fifth manager since lajoie gave up the role in 1909 finished 757815 p19 lajoie and joe jackson tied for the team lead with 90 rbis5 p20 he finished fourth in the al with a 368 batting average52 in 1913 birmingham and lajoie had arguments in the open including one incident in june when lajoie cursed birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump5 p20 lajoie hit 335 on the year the last time he would hit over 300 in his career1 only two other major league players had attained 3000 career hits until lajoie hit a double on september 27 1914 and so joined cap anson and honus wagner in the 3000 hit club3 p77 14 lajoie recorded the hit off yankees pitcher marty mchale in a 53 naps win5 p22 53 his 258 batting average for the season however was the lowest since he had joined the majors in 18961 the naps finished in last place in the american league standings with a 51102 record their worst record since joining the league and the franchises lowest winning percentage 33354 lajoie requested that somers trade him and the club obliged selling lajoie to the athletics for the waiver price and in so doing lajoie returned to philadelphia5 p22 40 p74 the following season 1915 lajoie returned to the athletics when mack signed him to a contract14 in his first season back with the athletics he finished with a 280 batting average but the team ended the season in last place with a 43109 record155 the 1916 season would be lajoies last in the majors in his final major league game he hit a triple to help athletics pitcher joe bush win his nohitter22 p100 lajoie aged 41 years played in 113 games and finished with a 246 average1 philadelphias season record was worse than the previous seasons franchiselow record and the team finished in last place again with a 36117 record56 the athletics winning percentage 235 is the franchises worst winning percentage through the 2021 season moreover it is the lowest of any major league team in the modern post1900 era5758 p105 in 1917 lajoie joined the toronto maple leafs of the international league as manager at the age of 42 lajoie won the leagues batting title with batting average of 380 he appeared in 151 of 156 games and for the first time in his career played on a team that won a pennant22 p100 he later was signed by the brooklyn dodgers for 3000 62715 in current dollar terms in march 1918 but the contract was annulled by the commissioners office and made a free agent to which lajoie was well pleased5960 later that same year he joined the indianapolis indians of the american association as playermanager he helped lead the team to a thirdplace finish but the season was impacted due to the uss involvement in world war i lajoie made his services available to the draft board but they rejected his offer9 p43 on december 27 1918 lajoie announced his retirement from baseball22 p101 61 several years after his retirement a story in the milwaukee sentinel talked of lajoies ability to outguess any pitcher lajoie faced pitcher red donahue who avoided pitching fastballs to lajoie after seeing him go 4for4 against a fellow pitcher donahue instead made pitches on the outside corner to which lajoie reached over and hit them with ease62 donahue then aimed a pitch at lajoies head and he proceeded to hit a home run thats the kind i eat he said62 for the first part of the 20th century lajoies and ty cobbs statistics rivaled each other like few other players in the american league58 p10 in 1908 honus wagner and lajoie recorded their 2000th career hits baseball historian david anderson wrote nap lajoie reached the milestone later in the summer with even less hoopla in an age when individual records received little attention from the press and were generally scorned by many players players overly worried about their individual stats were often unpopular with teammates the modesty of wagner and lajoie over their achievements contrasted sharply with cobbs ambition and overriding interest in his individual numbers23 p132 the lajoiecobb rivalry reached a peak in 1910 when hugh chalmers of the chalmers auto company a direct predecessor to modernday chrysler promised a chalmers 30 roadster to the seasons batting champion64 the public became fascinated with the daily statistics of lajoie and cobb in what became known as the chalmers race sports bettors who by this time followed the sport attentively also followed the daily reports with interest cobb took the final two games a doubleheader off against the chicago white sox confident that his average was safe and would allow him to win the al batting titleunless lajoie had a nearperfect final day going into the final game of the season cobbs average led lajoies 383 to 37665 lajoie and the naps faced a doubleheader against the st louis browns in sportsmans park clevelands final two games of the season after a sunhindered fly ball went for a standup triple and another batted ball landed for a cleanly hit single lajoie had five subsequent hits bunt singles dropped in front of rookie third baseman red corriden whose normal position was shortstop who was playing closer to shallow left field on orders it has been suggested of manager jack oconnor66 in his final at bat of the second game lajoie reached base on another bunt but the throw to first by corriden was off target and the play was scored an error and thus lajoie did not record an official atbat nor a hit67 he finished the doubleheader 8for8 and his batting average increased to 384 001 greater than cobbs mark although the al office had not officially announced the results lajoie began to receive congratulations from fans and players including eight of cobbs detroit tigers teammates most players in the league preferred lajoies personality to that of cobbs32 p124 coach harry howell is reported to have said to the games official scorer e v parish to do well by lajoie64 howell was reported to have offered a bribe to parish which as described in al stumps biography of cobb was a 40 1303 in current dollar terms suit parish refused the offer and the resulting uproar ended in oconnor and howell being banned from the major leagues by al president ban johnson johnson had the matter investigated and after having cobbs september 24 doubleheader statistics rechecked discovered only the first game of cobbs statistics had been scored but not the second game in which he went 2for3 this put cobbs suggested actual batting average at 385 again ahead of lajoies in the end johnson ruled that lajoies sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit which would have allowed him to go 9for9 but that cobbs batting average was greater recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to lajoies 227 hits in 591 at bats64 johnson asked chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player to which he agreed lajoie initially refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it66 cobb said i am glad that i won an automobile and am especially pleased that lajoie also gets one i have no one to criticize i know the games were on the square and i am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely32 p125 lajoie said i am quite satisfied that i was treated fairly in every way by president johnson but i think the scorer at st louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits however i am glad that the controversy is over i have the greatest respect for cobb as a batter and am glad of his success32 p125 the sporting news published an article written by paul macfarlane in its april 18 1981 issue where historian pete palmer had discovered that while cobbs september 24 doubleheader was not correctly tabulated perhaps purposely according to the correct date the second games statistics were in fact included in the next days ledger thus incorrectly recording a second 2for3 performance from cobb which meant lajoies average was greater646869 author james vail wrote in 2001 to date it seems that no one knows for certain who won that 1910 batting title total baseball which is now the official majorleague record lists both men at 384 in its seasonal section but its player register has lajoie at the same number and cobb at 383so even the various editors of that source do not or cannot agree70 jon wertheim wrote in sports illustrated 100 years after the event the statistics for the detroit players had been crossed out and nullified every detroit player that is except one ty cobb it takes something less than a detective to arrive at the conclusion that at some point johnson or someone in the league office anyway realized the error and decided to conceal it64 lajoie ended his career with a lifetime 338 batting average his career total of 3252 hits was the secondmost in mlb history at the time of his retirement behind only honus wagners total 3420 lajoies 2522 hits in the american league was that leagues record until cobb surpassed his mark71 he was among the second group of players elected to the hall of fame in 1937 and was later inducted on june 12 1939 when the hall opened that same year72 lajoie obtained the greatest number of votes as he led induction mates tris speaker 165 votes and cy young 153 with 168 votes 836 percent of ballots from the baseball writers association of america7374 lajoie led all second basemen in the nl in putouts 1898 and the al four times in his career 1901 1903 1906 and 1908 from 19061908 he led the al in assists amongst second basemen1 he also led the league in double plays six times in his career41 p339 baseball historian william mcneil rates lajoie as the games greatest second baseman when combining both offensive and defensive impact75 bill james argues in the last 20 years several statistical analysts have credited lajoie with immense defensive value this analysis is incorrect he was a competent fielder even a good fielder he was not a defensive superstar42 p487 during spring training before the 1928 season lajoie commented on the 1927 new york yankees of course you could see a lot of loafing going on but if that club is the greatest of all times you just know that we had a lot of clubs in my time who were world champions and didnt know it76 he died in daytona beach florida on february 7 1959 at the age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia7778 he had fallen in the autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm2 his wife had died earlier in 195110 in 1999 he ranked number 29 on the sporting news list of the 100 greatest baseball players and was a nominee for the major league baseball allcentury team79 lajoie was included in the checklist for the 1933 baseball card set produced by the goudey gum company however the card 106 in the set became infamous for being impossible to find copies of80 while the company eventually sent copies of the card to those collectors who wrote in to complain it was revealed years later that the uncut sheets of the set did not include the card and the alleged 1933 lajoie card was printed with the 1934 set today the card is among the highest value from the set81 lajoie is mentioned in the poem lineup for yesterday by ogden nash l is for lajoiewhom clevelanders lovenapoleon himselfwith glue in his glove in ring lardners 1911 baseball song gee its a wonderful game a stanza refers to lajoie who lost out in the battle of old waterloo i dont know i dont know they say twas napoleon maybe its true maybe so i dont know the pink sheets dont print mr bonapartes face no stories about him today cause he never could hold down that old second base like his name sake big nap layoohway lajoies likeness made a brief cameo appearance in the 1992 the simpsons episode homer at the bat as one of the wouldbe ringers for mr burns company softball team mr burns had planned to have lajoie play second base until his assistant smithers points out that all of the players mr burns had selected had long since retired and died a major league baseball has not revised cobbs batting average which would then designate lajoie as the 1910 batting champion the sporting news wrote of statistical evidence showing cobbs 1910 season statistics had been tampered with and he was given two extra base hits but mlb commissioner bowie kuhn declined to announce lajoie the winner83 both the society for american baseball research and baseballreferencecom list lajoie as having the higher batting average and thus the batting champion498485 italics denotes active player
