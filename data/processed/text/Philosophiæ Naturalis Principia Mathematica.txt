philosophi naturalis principia mathematica english the mathematical principles of natural philosophy1 often referred to as simply the principia prnspi prnkpi is a book by isaac newton that expounds newtons laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation the principia is written in latin and comprises three volumes and was authorized imprimatur by samuel pepys thenpresident of the royal society on 5 july 1686 and first published in 168723 the principia is considered one of the most important works in the history of science4 the french mathematical physicist alexis clairaut assessed it in 1747 the famous book of mathematical principles of natural philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics the method followed by its illustrious author sir newton spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses5 the french scientist josephlouis lagrange described it as the greatest production of the human mind6 french polymath pierresimon laplace stated that the principia is preeminent above any other production of human genius7 newtons work has also been called the greatest scientific work in history and the supreme expression in human thought of the minds ability to hold the universe fixed as an object of contemplation8 a more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of newtons laws was not immediate by the end of the century after publication in 1687 no one could deny that out of the principia a science had emerged that at least in certain respects so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally9 the principia forms a mathematical foundation for the theory of classical mechanics among other achievements it explains johannes keplers laws of planetary motion which kepler had first obtained empirically in formulating his physical laws newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of calculus expressing them in the form of geometric propositions about vanishingly small shapes10 in a revised conclusion to the principia see general scholium newton emphasized the empirical nature of the work with the expression hypotheses non fingo i framefeign no hypotheses11 after annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition12 newton published two further editions during 171313 with errors of the 1687 corrected and an improved version14 of 172613 the preface of the work states15 rational mechanics will be the sciences of motion resulting from any forces whatsoever and of the forces required to produce any motion accurately proposed and demonstrated and therefore we offer this work as mathematical principles of his philosophy for all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in thisfrom the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena newton situates himself within the contemporary scientific movement which had omited substantial forms and the occult qualities and instead endeavoured to explain the world by empirical investigation and outlining of empirical regularities16 the principia deals primarily with massive bodies in motion initially under a variety of conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both nonresisting and resisting media thus offering criteria to decide by observations which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed it attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles it explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites the book the opening sections of the principia contain in revised and extended form nearly17 all of the content of newtons 1684 tract de motu corporum in gyrum the principia begin with definitions18 and axioms or laws of motion19 and continues in three books book 1 subtitled de motu corporum on the motion of bodies concerns motion in the absence of any resisting medium it opens with a collection of mathematical lemmas on the method of first and last ratios20 a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus10 the second section establishes relationships between centripetal forces and the law of areas now known as keplers second law propositions 1321 and relates circular velocity and radius of pathcurvature to radial force22 proposition 4 and relationships between centripetal forces varying as the inversesquare of the distance to the center and orbits of conicsection form propositions 510 propositions 113123 establish properties of motion in paths of eccentric conicsection form including ellipses and their relationship with inversesquare central forces directed to a focus and include newtons theorem about ovals lemma 28 propositions 434524 are demonstration that in an eccentric orbit under centripetal force where the apse may move a steady nonmoving orientation of the line of apses is an indicator of an inversesquare law of force book 1 contains some proofs with little connection to realworld dynamics but there are also sections with farreaching application to the solar system and universe propositions 576925 deal with the motion of bodies drawn to one another by centripetal forces this section is of primary interest for its application to the solar system and includes proposition 6626 along with its 22 corollaries27 here newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions a problem which later gained name and fame among other reasons for its great difficulty as the threebody problem propositions 708428 deal with the attractive forces of spherical bodies the section contains newtons proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre this fundamental result called the shell theorem enables the inverse square law of gravitation to be applied to the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation part of the contents originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums just as newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in book 1 here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance thus section 1 discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity and section 2 goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity book 2 also discusses in section 5 hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids newton also derives boyles law29 the effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in section 6 along with newtons account of experiments that he carried out to try to find out some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties material weight size in section 8 he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation proposition 4830 this would become very important in acoustics he assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air31 less of book 2 has stood the test of time than of books 1 and 3 and it has been said that book 2 was largely written to refute a theory of descartes which had some wide acceptance before newtons work and for some time after according to descartess theory of vortices planetary motions were produced by the whirling of fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space and carried the planets along with them32 newton concluded book 233 by commenting that the hypothesis of vortices was completely at odds with the astronomical phenomena and served not so much to explain as to confuse them book 3 subtitled de mundi systemate on the system of the world is an exposition of many consequences of universal gravitation especially its consequences for astronomy it builds upon the propositions of the previous books and applies them with further specificity than in book 1 to the motions observed in the solar system here introduced by proposition 2234 and continuing in propositions 253535 are developed several of the features and irregularities of the orbital motion of the moon especially the variation newton lists the astronomical observations on which he relies36 and establishes in a stepwise manner that the inverse square law of mutual gravitation applies to solar system bodies starting with the satellites of jupiter37 and going on by stages to show that the law is of universal application38 he also gives starting at lemma 439 and proposition 4040 the theory of the motions of comets for which much data came from john flamsteed and edmond halley and accounts for the tides41 attempting quantitative estimates of the contributions of the sun42 and moon43 to the tidal motions and offers the first theory of the precession of the equinoxes44 book 3 also considers the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions and motion in arbitrary force laws in book 3 newton also made clear his heliocentric view of the solar system modified in a somewhat modern way since already in the mid1680s he recognised the deviation of the sun from the centre of gravity of the solar system45 for newton the common centre of gravity of the earth the sun and all the planets is to be esteemd the centre of the world46 and that this centre either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line47 newton rejected the second alternative after adopting the position that the centre of the system of the world is immoveable which is acknowledgd by all while some contend that the earth others that the sun is fixd in that centre47 newton estimated the mass ratios sunjupiter and sunsaturn48 and pointed out that these put the centre of the sun usually a little way off the common center of gravity but only a little the distance at most would scarcely amount to one diameter of the sun49 the sequence of definitions used in setting up dynamics in the principia is recognisable in many textbooks today newton first set out the definition of mass the quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude a body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity this quantity i designate by the name of body or of mass this was then used to define the quantity of motion today called momentum and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous cartesian notion of intrinsic force this then set the stage for the introduction of forces through the change in momentum of a body curiously for todays readers the exposition looks dimensionally incorrect since newton does not introduce the dimension of time in rates of changes of quantities he defined space and time not as they are well known to all instead he defined true time and space as absolute50 and explained only i must observe that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to perceptible objects and it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and common instead of absolute places and motions we use relative ones and that without any inconvenience in common affairs but in philosophical discussions we ought to step back from our senses and consider things themselves distinct from what are only perceptible measures of them to some modern readers it can appear that some dynamical quantities recognised today were used in the principia but not named the mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted for example john locke asked christiaan huygens whether he could trust the mathematical proofs and was assured about their correctness however the concept of an attractive force acting at a distance received a cooler response in his notes newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter however he retracted this sentence in the published version where he stated that the motion of planets is consistent with an inverse square law but refused to speculate on the origin of the law huygens and gottfried wilhelm leibniz noted that the law was incompatible with the notion of the aether from a cartesian point of view therefore this was a faulty theory newtons defence has been adopted since by many famous physicistshe pointed out that the mathematical form of the theory had to be correct since it explained the data and he refused to speculate further on the basic nature of gravity the sheer number of phenomena that could be organised by the theory was so impressive that younger philosophers soon adopted the methods and language of the principia perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding newton included at the beginning of book 3 in the second 1713 and third 1726 editions a section titled rules of reasoning in philosophy in the four rules as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them the four rules of the 1726 edition run as follows omitting some explanatory comments that follow each this section of rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of phenomena in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations that newton used as the basis for inferences later on as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time both the rules and the phenomena evolved from one edition of the principia to the next rule 4 made its appearance in the third 1726 edition rules 13 were present as rules in the second 1713 edition and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687 but there they had a different heading they were not given as rules but rather in the first 1687 edition the predecessors of the three later rules and of most of the later phenomena were all lumped together under a single heading hypotheses in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later rule 3 from this textual evolution it appears that newton wanted by the later headings rules and phenomena to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements in the third 1726 edition of the principia newton explains each rule in an alternative way andor gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming the first rule is explained as a philosophers principle of economy the second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind for example respiration in humans and in animals fires in the home and in the sun or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets an extensive explanation is given of the third rule concerning the qualities of bodies and newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space the general scholium is a concluding essay added to the second edition 1713 and amended in the third edition 172651 it is not to be confused with the general scholium at the end of book 2 section 6 which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air water and other fluids here newton used the expression hypotheses non fingo i formulate no hypotheses11 in response to criticisms of the first edition of the principia fingo is sometimes nowadays translated feign rather than the traditional frame although feign does not properly translate fingo newtons gravitational attraction an invisible force able to act over vast distances had led to criticism that he had introduced occult agencies into science52 newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction as they did but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena such hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy in contrast to the proper way in which particular propositions are inferrd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction53 newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions of descartes pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets which carry them through all parts of the heavens indifferently newton also gave theological argument from the system of the world he inferred the existence of a god along lines similar to what is sometimes called the argument from intelligent or purposive design it has been suggested that newton gave an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of god and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the trinity5455 the general scholium does not address or attempt to refute the church doctrine it simply does not mention jesus the holy ghost or the hypothesis of the trinity in january 1684 edmond halley christopher wren and robert hooke had a conversation in which hooke claimed to not only have derived the inversesquare law but also all the laws of planetary motion wren was unconvinced hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it and halley who could derive the inversesquare law for the restricted circular case by substituting keplers relation into huygens formula for the centrifugal force but failed to derive the relation generally resolved to ask newton56 halleys visits to newton in 1684 thus resulted from halleys debates about planetary motion with wren and hooke and they seem to have provided newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica halley was at that time a fellow and council member of the royal society in london positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the societys paid clerk57 halleys visit to newton in cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in august58 when halley asked newtons opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between halley hooke and wren59 newton surprised halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago but that he could not find the papers matching accounts of this meeting come from halley and the french mathematician abraham de moivre in whom newton had confided halley then had to wait for newton to find the results and in november 1684 newton sent halley an amplified version of whatever previous work newton had done on the subject this took the form of a 9page manuscript de motu corporum in gyrum of the motion of bodies in an orbit the title is shown on some surviving copies although the lost original may have been without a title newtons tract de motu corporum in gyrum which he sent to halley in late 1684 derived what is now known as the three laws of kepler assuming an inverse square law of force and generalised the result to conic sections it also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium the contents of de motu so excited halley by their mathematical and physical originality and farreaching implications for astronomical theory that he immediately went to visit newton again in november 1684 to ask newton to let the royal society have more of such work60 the results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid168661 newtons singleminded attention to his work generally and to his project during this time is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period humphrey newton his account tells of isaac newtons absorption in his studies how he sometimes forgot his food or his sleep or the state of his clothes and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down62 other evidence also shows newtons absorption in the principia newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments and he normally kept dated notes of them but for a period from may 1684 to april 1686 newtons chemical notebooks have no entries at all63 so it seems that newton abandoned pursuits to which he was formally dedicated and did very little else for well over a year and a half but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work the first of the three constituent books was sent to halley for the printer in spring 1686 and the other two books somewhat later the complete work published by halley at his own financial risk64 appeared in july 1687 newton had also communicated de motu to flamsteed and during the period of composition he exchanged a few letters with flamsteed about observational data on the planets eventually acknowledging flamsteeds contributions in the published version of the principia of 1687 the process of writing that first edition of the principia went through several stages and drafts some parts of the preliminary materials still survive while others are lost except for fragments and crossreferences in other documents65 surviving materials show that newton up to some time in 1685 conceived his book as a twovolume work the first volume was to be titled de motu corporum liber primus with contents that later appeared in extended form as book 1 of the principiacitation needed a faircopy draft of newtons planned second volume de motu corporum liber secundus survives its completion dated to about the summer of 1685 it covers the application of the results of liber primus to the earth the moon the tides the solar system and the universe in this respect it has much the same purpose as the final book 3 of the principia but it is written much less formally and is more easily readcitation needed it is not known just why newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in de motu corporum liber secundus of 1685 but he largely started afresh in a new tighter and less accessible mathematical style eventually to produce book 3 of the principia as we know it newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had first composed this book in a popular method that it might be read by many but to prevent the disputes by readers who could not lay aside their prejudices he had reduced it into the form of propositions in the mathematical way which should be read by those only who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books66 the final book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by newton in the meantime especially about the theory of the motions of comets and some of the perturbations of the motions of the moon the result was numbered book 3 of the principia rather than book 2 because in the meantime drafts of liber primus had expanded and newton had divided it into two books the new and final book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums67 but the liber secundus of 1685 can still be read today even after it was superseded by book 3 of the principia it survived complete in more than one manuscript after newtons death in 1727 the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an english translation in 1728 by persons still unknown not authorised by newtons heirs it appeared under the english title a treatise of the system of the world68 this had some amendments relative to newtons manuscript of 1685 mostly to remove crossreferences that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of book 1 of the principia newtons heirs shortly afterwards published the latin version in their possession also in 1728 under the new title de mundi systemate amended to update crossreferences citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the principia making it look superficially as if it had been written by newton after the principia rather than before69 the system of the world was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions with similar changes as in the latin printing a second edition 1731 and a corrected reprint70 of the second edition 1740 the text of the first of the three books of the principia was presented to the royal society at the close of april 1686 hooke made some priority claims but failed to substantiate them causing some delay when hookes claim was made known to newton who hated disputes newton threatened to withdraw and suppress book 3 altogether but halley showing considerable diplomatic skills tactfully persuaded newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication samuel pepys as president gave his imprimatur on 30 june 1686 licensing the book for publication the society had just spent its book budget on de historia piscium71 and the cost of publication was borne by edmund halley who was also then acting as publisher of the philosophical transactions of the royal society72 the book appeared in summer 168773 after halley had personally financed the publication of principia he was informed that the society could no longer afford to provide him the promised annual salary of 50 instead halley was paid with leftover copies of de historia piscium74 nicolaus copernicus had moved the earth away from the center of the universe with the heliocentric theory for which he presented evidence in his book de revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres published in 1543 johannes kepler wrote the book astronomia nova a new astronomy in 1609 setting out the evidence that planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus and that planets do not move with constant speed along this orbit rather their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times to these two laws he added a third a decade later in his 1619 book harmonices mundi harmonies of the world this law sets out a proportionality between the third power of the characteristic distance of a planet from the sun and the square of the length of its year the foundation of modern dynamics was set out in galileos book dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo dialogue on the two main world systems where the notion of inertia was implicit and used in addition galileos experiments with inclined planes had yielded precise mathematical relations between elapsed time and acceleration velocity or distance for uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of bodies descartes book of 1644 principia philosophiae principles of philosophy stated that bodies can act on each other only through contact a principle that induced people among them himself to hypothesize a universal medium as the carrier of interactions such as light and gravitythe aether newton was criticized for apparently introducing forces that acted at distance without any medium52 not until the development of particle theory was descartes notion vindicated when it was possible to describe all interactions like the strong weak and electromagnetic fundamental interactions using mediating gauge bosons75 and gravity through hypothesized gravitons76 newton had studied these books or in some cases secondary sources based on them and taken notes entitled quaestiones quaedam philosophicae questions about philosophy during his days as an undergraduate during this period 16641666 he created the basis of calculus and performed the first experiments in the optics of colour at this time his proof that white light was a combination of primary colours found via prismatics replaced the prevailing theory of colours and received an overwhelmingly favourable response and occasioned bitter disputes with robert hooke and others which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book opticks by the 1670s in response work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters including two to leibniz he became a fellow of the royal society and the second lucasian professor of mathematics succeeding isaac barrow at trinity college cambridge in the 1660s newton studied the motion of colliding bodies and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show newtons interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown for a circular case of planetary motion that the force he called endeavour to recede now called centrifugal force had an inversesquare relation with distance from the center77 after his 16791680 correspondence with hooke described below newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force according to newton scholar j bruce brackenridge although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view as between centrifugal or centripetal forces the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way they also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements which newton was making in the 1660s the difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view though a significant change of perspective did not change the analysis78 newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s for this newton was indebted to descartes work published 164479 hooke published his ideas about gravitation in the 1660s and again in 1674 he argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in micrographia of 1665 in a 1666 royal society lecture on gravity and again in 1674 when he published his ideas about the system of the world in somewhat developed form as an addition to an attempt to prove the motion of the earth from observations80 hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the sun and planets in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body along with a principle of linear inertia hookes statements up to 1674 made no mention however that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions hookes gravitation was also not yet universal though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses81 hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration on these two aspects hooke stated in 1674 now what these several degrees of gravitational attraction are i have not yet experimentally verified indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow and as to his whole proposal this i only hint at present having my self many other things in hand which i would first compleat and therefore cannot so well attend it ie prosecuting this inquiry80 in november 1679 hooke began an exchange of letters with newton of which the full text is now published82 hooke told newton that hooke had been appointed to manage the royal societys correspondence83 and wished to hear from members about their researches or their views about the researches of others and as if to whet newtons interest he asked what newton thought about various matters giving a whole list mentioning compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body and my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse and then a new hypothesis from paris about planetary motions which hooke described at length and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys the difference of latitude between london and cambridge and other items newtons reply offered a fansy of my own about a terrestrial experiment not a proposal about celestial motions which might detect the earths motion by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall the main point was to indicate how newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the earths motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid earth had not been in the way on a spiral path to the centre hooke disagreed with newtons idea of how the body would continue to move84 a short further correspondence developed and towards the end of it hooke writing on 6 january 1680 to newton communicated his supposition that the attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall and consequently that the velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the attraction and consequently as kepler supposes reciprocall to the distance85 hookes inference about the velocity was actually incorrect86 in 1686 when the first book of newtons principia was presented to the royal society hooke claimed that newton had obtained from him the notion of the rule of the decrease of gravity being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the center at the same time according to edmond halleys contemporary report hooke agreed that the demonstration of the curves generated therby was wholly newtons82 a recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that by the late 1660s the assumption of an inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons87 newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption force in the radial direction had an inversesquare relation with distance from the center77 newton faced in may 1686 with hookes claim on the inverse square law denied that hooke was to be credited as author of the idea giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before hooke82 newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from hooke which it had not he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy while hooke without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition could only guess according to newton that it was approximately valid at great distances from the center82 the background described above shows there was basis for newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from hooke on the other hand newton did accept and acknowledge in all editions of the principia that hooke but not exclusively hooke had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system newton acknowledged wren hooke and halley in this connection in the scholium to proposition 4 in book 188 newton also acknowledged to halley that his correspondence with hooke in 167980 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters but that did not mean according to newton that hooke had told newton anything new or original yet am i not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the ellipsis which inclined me to try it 82 newtons reawakening interest in astronomy received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 16801681 on which he corresponded with john flamsteed89 in 1759 decades after the deaths of both newton and hooke alexis clairaut mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies made his assessment after reviewing what hooke had published on gravitation one must not think that this idea of hooke diminishes newtons glory clairaut wrote the example of hooke serves to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated9091 it has been estimated that as many as 750 copies92 of the first edition were printed by the royal society and it is quite remarkable that so many copies of this small first edition are still in existence but it may be because the original latin text was more revered than read93 a survey published in 1953 located 189 surviving copies94 with nearly 200 further copies located by the most recent survey published in 2020 suggesting that the initial print run was larger than previously thought95 however more recent book historical and bibliographical research has examined those prior claims and concludes that macombers earlier estimation of 500 copies is likely correct96 in 2016 a first edition sold for 37 million110 the second edition 1713 were printed in 750 copies and the third edition 1726 were printed in 1250 copies a facsimile edition based on the 3rd edition of 1726 but with variant readings from earlier editions and important annotations was published in 1972 by alexandre koyr and i bernard cohen13 two later editions were published by newton newton had been urged to make a new edition of the principia since the early 1690s partly because copies of the first edition had already become very rare and expensive within a few years after 1687111 newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with flamsteed in november 1694112 newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions two of these copies still survive113 but he had not completed the revisions by 1708 newton had almost severed connections with one wouldbe editor nicolas fatio de duillier and another david gregory seems not to have met with his approval and was also terminally ill dying in 1708 nevertheless reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer114 richard bentley master of trinity college persuaded newton to allow him to undertake a second edition and in june 1708 bentley wrote to newton with a specimen print of the first sheet at the same time expressing the unfulfilled hope that newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions115 it seems that bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him and with newtons consent he appointed roger cotes plumian professor of astronomy at trinity to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy but bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit the correspondence of 17091713 shows cotes reporting to two masters bentley and newton and managing and often correcting a large and important set of revisions to which newton sometimes could not give his full attention116 under the weight of cotes efforts but impeded by priority disputes between newton and leibniz117 and by troubles at the mint118 cotes was able to announce publication to newton on 30 june 1713119 bentley sent newton only six presentation copies cotes was unpaid newton omitted any acknowledgement to cotes among those who gave newton corrections for the second edition were firmin abauzit roger cotes and david gregory however newton omitted acknowledgements to some because of the priority disputes john flamsteed the astronomer royal suffered this especially the second edition was the basis of the first edition to be printed abroad which appeared in amsterdam in 1714 after his serious illness in 1722 and after the appearance of a reprint of the second edition in amsterdam in 1723 the 80yearold newton began to revise once again the principia in the fall of 1723 the third edition was published 25 march 1726 under the stewardship of henry pemberton md a man of the greatest skill in these matters pemberton later said that this recognition was worth more to him than the two hundred guinea award from newton120 in 17391742 two french priests pres thomas leseur and franois jacquier of the minim order but sometimes erroneously identified as jesuits produced with the assistance of jl calandrini an extensively annotated version of the principia in the 3rd edition of 1726 sometimes this is referred to as the jesuit edition it was much used and reprinted more than once in scotland during the 19th century121 milie du chtelet also made a translation of newtons principia into french unlike leseur and jacquiers edition hers was a complete translation of newtons three books and their prefaces she also included a commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary she included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to newtons most controversial theories previously geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories du chtelets translation is the only complete one to have been done in french and hers remains the standard french translation to this day122 four full english translations of newtons principia have appeared all based on newtons 3rd edition of 1726 the first from 1729 by andrew motte3 was described by newton scholar i bernard cohen in 1968 as still of enormous value in conveying to us the sense of newtons words in their own time and it is generally faithful to the original clear and well written123 the 1729 version was the basis for several republications often incorporating revisions among them a widely used modernised english version of 1934 which appeared under the editorial name of florian cajori though completed and published only some years after his death cohen pointed out ways in which the 18thcentury terminology and punctuation of the 1729 translation might be confusing to modern readers but he also made severe criticisms of the 1934 modernised english version and showed that the revisions had been made without regard to the original also demonstrating gross errors that provided the final impetus to our decision to produce a wholly new translation124 the second full english translation into modern english is the work that resulted from this decision by collaborating translators i bernard cohen anne whitman and julia budenz it was published in 1999 with a guide by way of introduction125 the third such translation is due to ian bruce and appears with many other translations of mathematical works of the 17th and 18th centuries on his website126 the fourth complete english translation is due to charles leedhamgreen professor emeritus of mathematics at queen mary university of london and was published in 2021 by cambridge university press127 prof leedhamgreen was motivated to produce that translation on which he worked for twenty years in part because of his dissatisfaction with the work of cohen whitman and budenz whose translation of the principia he found unnecessarily obscure leedhamgreens aim was to convey newtons own reasoning and arguments in a way intelligible to a modern mathematical scientist his translation is heavily annotated and his explanatory notes make use of the modern secondary literature on some of the more difficult technical aspects of newtons work dana densmore and william h donahue have published a translation of the works central argument published in 1996 along with expansion of included proofs and ample commentary128 the book was developed as a textbook for classes at st johns college and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the latin text129 in 1977 the spacecraft voyager 1 and 2 left earth for the interstellar space carrying a picture of a page from newtons principia mathematica as part of the golden record a collection of messages from humanity to extraterrestrials in 2014 british astronaut tim peake named his upcoming mission to the international space station principia after the book in honour of britains greatest scientist130 tim peakes principia launched on 15 december 2015 aboard soyuz tma19m131 first edition
