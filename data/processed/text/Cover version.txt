in popular music a cover version cover song remake revival or simply cover is a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song originally it referred to a version of a song released around the same time as the original in order to compete with it now it refers to any subsequent version performed after the original1 the term cover goes back decades when cover version originally described a rival version of a tune recorded to compete with the recently released original version2 examples of records covered include paul williams 1949 hit tune the hucklebuck and hank williams 19523 song jambalaya both crossed over to the popular hit parade and had numerous hit versions before the mid20th century the notion of an original version of a popular tune would have seemed slightly odd the production of musical entertainment was seen as a live event even if it was reproduced at home via a copy of the sheet music learned by heart or captured on a gramophone record in fact one of the principal objectives of publishing sheet music was to have a composition performed by as many artists as possible this made the song more important than the performing artist and rival cover or copycat versions would vie for success2 in previous generations some artists made very successful careers of presenting revivals or reworkings of oncepopular tunes even out of doing contemporary cover versions of current hits2 since the 1950s musicians now play what they call cover versions the reworking updating or interpretation of songs as a tribute to the original performer or group2 using familiar material such as evergreen hits standard tunes or classic recordings is an important method of learning music styles until the mid1960s most albums or long playing records contained a large number of evergreens or standards to present a fuller range of the artists abilities and style see for example please please me artists might also perform interpretations covers of a favorite artists hit tunes4 for the simple pleasure of playing a familiar song or collection of tunes5 today three broad types of entertainers depend on cover versions for their principal repertoire since the copyright act of 1909 united states musicians have had the right to record a version of someone elses previously recorded and released tune whether it is music alone or music with lyrics6 a mechanical license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder or recording published tunes can fall under a compulsory license whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original authorcopyright holder through an organization such as the harry fox agency or easy song licensing and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author7 a similar service was provided by limelight by rightsflow until january 2015 when they announced they will be closing their service the us congress introduced the mechanical license to head off an attempt by the aeolian company to monopolize the piano roll market8 in 2021 the music modernization act established the mlc as the designated nonprofit entity to administer the blanket compulsory licensing on digital platforms9 although a composer cannot deny anyone a mechanical license for a new recorded version the composer has the right to decide who will release the first recording of a song bob dylan took advantage of this right when he refused his own record company the right to release a live recording of mr tambourine man6 even with this prerelease cover versions of songs can occasionally occur live performances of copyrighted songs are typically arranged through performing rights organizations such as ascap or bmi early in the 20th century it became common for phonograph record labels to have singers or musicians cover a commercially successful hit tune by recording a version for their own label in hopes of cashing in on the tunes success for example aint she sweet was popularized in 1927 by eddie cantor on stage and by ben bernie and gene austin on record was repopularized through popular recordings by mr goon bones mr ford and pearl bailey in 1949 and later still revived as 33 13 and 45 rpm records by the beatles in 196410 because little promotion or advertising was done in the early days of record production other than at the local music hall or music store the average buyer purchasing a new record usually asked for the tune not the artist record distribution was highly localized so a locally popular artist could quickly record a version of a hit song from another area and reach an audience before the version by the artists who first introduced the tune and highly competitive record companies were quick to take advantage of this this began to change in the late 1930s when the growing recordbuying public began including a younger age group during the swing era when a bobby soxer went looking for a recorded tune say in the mood typically she wanted the version popularized by her favorite artists eg the glenn miller version on rca victors cheaper bluebird label not someone elses sometimes presented on a more expensive record companys label this trend was marked closely by the charting of record sales by the different artists not just hit tunes on the music industrys hit parades however for sound commercial reasons record companies still continued to record different versions of tunes that sold well most audiences until the mid1950s still heard their favorite artists playing live music on stage or via the radio and since radio shows were for the most part aimed at local audiences it was still rare for an artist in one area to reach a mass audience also radio stations tended to cater to broad audience markets so an artist in one vein might not get broadcast on other stations geared to a set audience so popular versions of jazz country and western or rhythm and blues tunes and vice versa were frequent an example is mack the knife die moritat von mackie messer originally from bertolt brechts 1928 die dreigroschenoper it was popularized by a 1956 hit parade instrumental tune moritat for the dick hyman trio also recorded by richard hayman jan august11 but a hit also for louis armstrong 19561959 bobby darin 195912 and ella fitzgerald 196013 as vocal versions of mack the knife europes radio luxembourg like many commercial stations also sold air time so record companies and others bought air time to promote their own artists or products thus increasing the number of recorded versions of any tune then available add to this the fact that many radio stations were limited in their permitted needle time the amount of recorded music they were allowed to play or were regulated on the amount of local talent they had to promote in live broadcasts as with most national stations like the bbc in the uk in the us broadcasters pay royalties to authors and publishers artists are not paid royalties so there is an incentive to record numerous versions of a song particularly in different genres for example king records frequently cut both rhythm and blues and country and western versions of novelty songs like good morning judge and dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me this tradition was expanded when rhythm and blues songs began appearing on pop music charts2 in the early days of rock and roll many tunes originally recorded by rb and country musicians were still being rerecorded in a more popular vein by other artists with a more toneddown style or professional polish14 this was inevitable because radio stations were reluctant to play formats outside their target audiences taste by far the most popular style of music in the mid1950s mid1960s was still the professional light orchestra therefore popular recording artists sought that format15 for many purists these popular versions lacked the raw earthiness of the original introducing artists most did not have the kudos that rebellious teenagers craved the street credibility of rock and roll music most were performed and some were written by black artists not heard in popular mass entertainment markets16 most parents considered the bowdlerized popular cover versions more palatable for the mass audience of parents and their children artists targeting the whitemajority family audience were more acceptable to programmers at most radio and tv stations singersongwriter don mclean called the cover version a racist tool172 many parents in the 1950s 60s whether intentionally racist or not felt deeply threatened by the rapid pace of social change they had for the most part shared entertainment with their parents in ways their children had become reluctant to do the jukebox and the personal record disc player were still relatively expensive pieces of machinery and the portable radio a great novelty allowing truculent teenagers to shut themselves off tunes by introducing or original niche market artists that became successful on the mass audience hit parade charts are called crossovers as they crossed over from the targeted country jazz or rhythm audience also many songs originally recorded by male artists were rerecorded by female artists and vice versa such a cover version is also sometimes called a cross cover version male cover or female cover some songs such as if only for one night were originally recorded by female artists but covered by mostly male artists reworking nonenglish language tunes and lyrics for the anglosaxon markets was once a popular part of the music business for example the 1954 worldwide hit the happy wanderer was originally der frhliche wanderer to this must be added hymne lamour mtterlein volare seeman quando quando quando lamour est bleu etc cover versions of many popular songs have been recorded sometimes with a radically different style sometimes virtually unrecognizable from the original for example sir mixalots 1992 rap baby got back was covered by indie rock singer jonathan coulton in 2005 in an acoustic soft rock style coultons cover was then covered without attribution in 2013 by the show glee and was so similar that coulton among others alleged plagiarism of his arrangement and melody18 some producers or recording artists may also enlist the services of a sample replay company such as titan tribute media or scorccio in order to replicate an original recording with precision detail and accuracy a song may be covered into another language for example in the 1930s a recording of isle of capri in spanish by osvaldo fresedo and singer roberto ray is known falcos 1982 germanlanguage hit der kommissar was covered in english by after the fire although the german title was retained the english version which was not a direct translation of falcos original but retained much of its spirit reached the top 5 on the us charts the lion sleeps tonight evolved over several decades and versions from a 1939 solomon linda a cappella song many of singer laura branigans 1980s hits were englishlanguage covers of songs already successful in europe for the american record market numerable englishlanguage covers exist of 99 luftballons by german singer nena notably one by punk band goldfinger one having been recorded by nena herself following the success of her original german version popcorn a song that was originally completely instrumental has had lyrics added in at least six different languages in various covers during the heyday of cantopop in hong kong in the late 1970s to early 1990s many hits were covers of english and japanese titles that have gained international fame but with localized lyrics sometimes multiple sets of lyrics sung to the same tune and critics often chide the music industry of shorting the tunecomposing process although modern cover versions are often produced for artistic reasons some aspects of the disingenuous spirit of early cover versions remain in the albumbuying heyday of the 1970s albums of soundalike covers were created commonly released to fill bargain bins in the music section of supermarkets and even specialized music stores where uninformed customers might easily confuse them with original recordings the packaging of such discs was often intentionally confusing combining the name of the original artist in large letters with a tiny disclaimer like as originally sung by or as made popular by more recently albums such as the kidz bop series of compact discs featuring versions of contemporary songs sung by children have sold successfully in 2009 the american musical comedydrama television series glee debuted featuring several musical performances per episode the series featured solely cover songs performed by the series titular glee club until near the end of its second season with the episode original song the series still primarily uses cover songs of both chart hits and show tunes occasionally as mashups or distinct variations the shows musical performances have been a commercial success with over twentyone million copies of glee cast single releases purchased digitally and over nine million albums purchased worldwide19 australian alternativeindie radio station triple j presents a weekly segment called like a version in which a band or musician performs one of their own songs as well as a song they love by another artist20 originating in 2004 the popularity of the performances21 have resulted in the release of annual compilation albums of selected covers and more recently votes in the annual triple j hottest 100 poll which has even sparked its own controversy22 conjoined cover songs are collectively referred to as a cover medley on occasion a cover can become more popular than the original for instance jimi hendrixs version of bob dylans all along the watchtower became the standard and dylan even adjusted his performance style closer to the hendrix version johnny cashs 2002 cover of hurt by nine inch nails is another example of the cover version eclipsing the original this is a widespread common occurrence in the music industry with advancements in artificial intelligence internet users can create covers using rvc models23 cover versions as the term is now used are often contemporary versions of familiar songs for example singin in the rain was originally introduced by cliff edwards in the film the hollywood revue of 1929 the famous gene kelly version was a revision that brought it up to date for a 1950s hollywood musical and was used in the 1952 film singin in the rain in 1978 it was covered by french singer sheila accompanied by the b devotion group as a disco song once more updating it to suit the musical taste of the era during the disco era there was a trend of taking well known songs and recording them in the disco style more recently singin in the rain has been covered and remixed by british act mint royale for a television commercial for volkswagen another example of this from a different angle is the tune blueberry hill many mistakenly believe the fats domino 1956 release to be the original recording and artist in fact it was originally introduced on film by gene autry and popularized on the record hit parade of 1940 by glenn miller the fats domino rock and roll version is the only one that might currently get widespread airplay on most media similarly unchained melody was originally performed by todd duncan featured in the 1955 film unchained based on the nonfiction story prisoners are people by kenyon j scudder al hibbler having the biggest number of worldwide record sales for the vocal version with jimmy youngs cover version rival outdoing this in the uk24 les baxters orchestra gaining the big instrumentalist sales reaching the us hit parade number one spot in may 195525 but the righteous brothers later version top five on the us hit parade of september 196526 stalling at number 14 in the uk in august is by far the wider known version and especially so following its appearance in the 1990 film ghost house of the rising sun has hundreds of versions and in many genres such as folk blues rock and punk as well as dance and dubstep27 director baz luhrmann has contemporized and stylized older songs for use in his films new or cover versions such as john paul youngs love is in the air occur in strictly ballroom candi statons young hearts run free appear in romeo juliet and adaptations of artists such as nat king cole nirvana kiss elton john thelma houston marilyn monroe madonna t rex david bowie queen and the police are used in moulin rouge the covers are carefully designed to fit into the structure of each film and suit the taste of the intended audience other artists release new versions of their own songs like german singer nena who recorded an entire album with great success with new versions of older hits cover songs can be used to display creativity of a performers work through the talent of another artists previous production not to be confused with a remix which is defined as altering or distorting the original sound electronically cover versions give a performer the ability to adapt music to their own style typically allowing them to change the genre of a song and recreating it to their own taste for example in 2008 fall out boy covered michael jacksons hit song beat it changing the genre from pop rock to a more punk rock feel another example is when my chemical romance covered the bob dylan track desolation row this is more common with todays covers taking older popular music and revamping it to compare with modern popular music aretha franklins cover of otis reddings respect was voted the greatest cover song of all time according to forbescom28
