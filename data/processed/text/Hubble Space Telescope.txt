the hubble space telescope hst or hubble is a space telescope that was launched into low earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation it was not the first space telescope but it is one of the largest and most versatile renowned as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy the hubble space telescope is named after astronomer edwin hubble and is one of nasas great observatories the space telescope science institute stsci selects hubbles targets and processes the resulting data while the goddard space flight center gsfc controls the spacecraft8 hubble features a 24 m 7 ft 10 in mirror and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet visible and nearinfrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum hubbles orbit outside the distortion of earths atmosphere allows it to capture extremely highresolution images with substantially lower background light than groundbased telescopes it has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images allowing a deep view into space many hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe the hubble space telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by nasa with contributions from the european space agency its intended launch was in 1983 but the project was beset by technical delays budget problems and the 1986 challenger disaster hubble was launched on sts31 in 1990 but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescopes capabilities the optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission sts61 in 1993 hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts five space shuttle missions repaired upgraded and replaced systems on the telescope including all five of the main instruments the fifth mission was initially canceled on safety grounds following the columbia disaster 2003 but after nasa administrator michael d griffin approved it the servicing mission was completed in 2009 hubble completed 30 years of operation in april 20201 and is predicted to last until 2030 to 20404 hubble is the visible light telescope in nasas great observatories program other parts of the spectrum are covered by the compton gamma ray observatory the chandra xray observatory and the spitzer space telescope which covers the infrared bands9 the midirtovisible band successor to the hubble telescope is the james webb space telescope jwst which was launched on december 25 2021 with the nancy grace roman space telescope due to follow in 2027101112 in 1923 hermann oberth considered a father of modern rocketry along with robert h goddard and konstantin tsiolkovsky published die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket into planetary space which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into earth orbit by a rocket13 the history of the hubble space telescope can be traced to 1946 to astronomer lyman spitzers paper astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory14 in it he discussed the two main advantages that a spacebased observatory would have over groundbased telescopes first the angular resolution the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished would be limited only by diffraction rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere which causes stars to twinkle known to astronomers as seeing at that time groundbased telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0510 arcseconds compared to a theoretical diffractionlimited resolution of about 005 arcsec for an optical telescope with a mirror 25 m 8 ft 2 in in diameter second a spacebased telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light which are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere of earth14 spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope15 in 1962 a report by the us national academy of sciences recommended development of a space telescope as part of the space program and in 1965 spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope16 also crucial was the work of nancy grace roman the mother of hubble17 well before it became an official nasa project she gave public lectures touting the scientific value of the telescope after it was approved she became the program scientist setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implement18 and writing testimony to congress throughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope19 her work as project scientist helped set the standards for nasas operation of large scientific projects20 spacebased astronomy had begun on a very small scale following world war ii as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology the first ultraviolet spectrum of the sun was obtained in 194621 and nasa launched the orbiting solar observatory oso to obtain uv xray and gammaray spectra in 196222 an orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the united kingdom as part of the ariel programme and in 1966 nasa launched the first orbiting astronomical observatory oao mission oao1s battery failed after three days terminating the mission it was followed by orbiting astronomical observatory 2 oao2 which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972 well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year23 the oso and oao missions demonstrated the important role spacebased observations could play in astronomy in 1968 nasa developed firm plans for a spacebased reflecting telescope with a mirror 3 m 98 ft in diameter known provisionally as the large orbiting telescope or large space telescope lst with a launch slated for 1979 these plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available24 the continuing success of the oao program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the lst should be a major goal in 1970 nasa established two committees one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission once these had been established the next hurdle for nasa was to obtain funding for the instrument which would be far more costly than any earthbased telescope the us congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope in 1974 public spending cuts led to congress deleting all funding for the telescope project25 in 1977 then nasa administrator james c fletcher proposed a token 5 million for hubble in nasas budget then nasa associate administrator for space science noel hinners instead cut all funding for hubble gambling that this would galvanize the scientific community into fighting for full funding as hinners recalls26 it was clear that year that we werent going to be able to get a fullup start there was some opposition on capitol hill to getting a new start on hubble it was driven in large part as i recall by the budget situation jim fletcher proposed that we put in five million as a placeholder i didnt like that idea it was in todays vernacular a sop to the astronomy community theres something in there so all is well i figured in my own little head that to get that community energized wed be better off zeroing it out then they would say whoa were in deep trouble and it would marshal the troops so i advocated that we not put anything in i dont remember any of the detailed discussions or whether there were any but jim went along with that so we zeroed it out it had from my perspective the desired impact of stimulating the astronomy community to renew their efforts on the lobbying front while i like to think in hindsight it was a brilliant political move im not sure i thought it through all that well it was something that was spur of the moment five million would let them think that all is well anyway but its not so lets give them a message my own thinking get them stimulated to get into action zeroing it out would certainly give that message i think it was as simple as that didnt talk to anybody else about doing it first just lets go do that voila it worked dont know whether id do that again the political ploy worked in response to hubble being zeroed out of nasas budget a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers many astronomers met congressmen and senators in person and largescale letterwriting campaigns were organized the national academy of sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope and eventually the senate agreed to half the budget that had originally been approved by congress27 the funding issues led to a reduction in the scale of the project with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 24 m both to cut costs28 and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware a proposed precursor 15 m 4 ft 11 in space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the european space agency esa esa agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope as well as the solar cells that would power it and staff to work on the telescope in the united states in return for european astronomers being guaranteed at least 15 of the observing time on the telescope29 congress eventually approved funding of 36 million for 1978 and the design of the lst began in earnest aiming for a launch date of 198327 in 1983 the telescope was named after edwin hubble30 who confirmed one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century made by georges lematre that the universe is expanding31 once the space telescope project had been given the goahead work on the program was divided among many institutions marshall space flight center msfc was given responsibility for the design development and construction of the telescope while goddard space flight center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and groundcontrol center for the mission32 msfc commissioned the optics company perkinelmer to design and build the optical telescope assembly ota and fine guidance sensors for the space telescope lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed33 optically the hst is a cassegrain reflector of ritcheychrtien design as are most large professional telescopes this design with two hyperbolic mirrors is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test the mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance and they were designed to exacting specifications optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light but the space telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet shorter wavelengths and was specified to be diffraction limited to take full advantage of the space environment therefore its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers or about 165 of the wavelength of red light34 on the long wavelength end the ota was not designed with optimum infrared performance in mind eg the mirrors are kept at stable and warm about 15c temperatures by heaters this limits hubbles performance as an infrared telescope35 perkinelmer pe intended to use custombuilt and extremely sophisticated computercontrolled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape33 however in case their cuttingedge technology ran into difficulties nasa demanded that pe subcontract to kodak to construct a backup mirror using traditional mirrorpolishing techniques36 the team of kodak and itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work their bid called for the two companies to doublecheck each others work which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused problems37 the kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the national air and space museum3839 an itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 24 m telescope at the magdalena ridge observatory40 construction of the perkinelmer mirror began in 1979 starting with a blank manufactured by corning from their ultralow expansion glass to keep the mirrors weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates each 25 mm 098 in thick sandwiching a honeycomb lattice perkinelmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force41 this ensured the mirrors final shape would be correct and to specification when deployed mirror polishing continued until may 1981 nasa reports at the time questioned perkinelmers managerial structure and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget to save money nasa halted work on the backup mirror and moved the launch date of the telescope to october 198442 the mirror was completed by the end of 1981 it was washed using 9100 l 2000 imp gal 2400 us gal of hot deionized water and then received a reflective coating of 65nmthick aluminum and a protective coating of 25nmthick magnesium fluoride3543 doubts continued to be expressed about perkinelmers competence on a project of this importance as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the ota continued to inflate in response to a schedule described as unsettled and changing daily nasa postponed the launch date of the telescope until april 1985 perkinelmers schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter and at times delays reached one day for each day of work nasa was forced to postpone the launch date until march and then september 1986 by this time the total project budget had risen to 1175 billion44 the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge it would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of earths shadow which would cause major changes in temperature while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope a shroud of multilayer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit within the shell a graphiteepoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned45 because graphite composites are hygroscopic there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in lockheeds clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space resulting in the telescopes instruments being covered by ice to reduce that risk a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space46 as well as electrical power systems the pointing control system controls hst orientation using five types of sensors magnetic sensors optical sensors and six gyroscopes and two types of actuators reaction wheels and magnetic torquers47 while construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the ota lockheed experienced some budget and schedule slippage and by the summer 1985 construction of the spacecraft was 30 over budget and three months behind schedule an msfc report said lockheed tended to rely on nasa directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction48 the two initial primary computers on the hst were the 125 mhz df224 system built by rockwell autonetics which contained three redundant cpus and two redundant nssc1 nasa standard spacecraft computer model 1 systems developed by westinghouse and gsfc using diodetransistor logic dtl a coprocessor for the df224 was added during servicing mission 1 in 1993 which consisted of two redundant strings of an intelbased 80386 processor with an 80387 math coprocessor49 the df224 and its 386 coprocessor were replaced by a 25 mhz intelbased 80486 processor system during servicing mission 3a in 199950 the new computer is 20 times faster with six times more memory than the df224 it replaced it increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages51 additionally some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessorbased control systems the mats multiple access transponder components mat1 and mat2 use hughes aircraft cdp1802cd microprocessors52 the wide field and planetary camera wfpc also used an rca 1802 microprocessor or possibly the older 1801 version53 the wfpc1 was replaced by the wfpc2 during servicing mission 1 in 1993 which was then replaced by the wide field camera 3 wfc3 during servicing mission 4 in 2009 the upgrade extended hubbles capability of seeing deeper into the universe and providing images in three broad regions of the spectrum5455 when launched the hst carried five scientific instruments the wide field and planetary camera wfpc goddard high resolution spectrograph ghrs high speed photometer hsp faint object camera foc and the faint object spectrograph fos wfpc used a radial instrument bay and the other four instruments were each installed in an axial instrument bay56 wfpc was a highresolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations it was built by nasas jet propulsion laboratory and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest the instrument contained eight chargecoupled device ccd chips divided between two cameras each using four ccds each ccd has a resolution of 064 megapixels57 the wide field camera wfc covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution while the planetary camera pc took images at a longer effective focal length than the wf chips giving it a greater magnification56 the goddard high resolution spectrograph ghrs was a spectrograph designed to operate in the ultraviolet it was built by the goddard space flight center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 9000058 also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the foc and fos which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on hubble rather than ccds these three instruments used photoncounting digicons as their detectors the foc was constructed by esa while the university of california san diego and martin marietta corporation built the fos56 the final instrument was the hsp designed and built at the university of wisconsinmadison it was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness it could take up to 100000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2 or better59 hsts guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument its three fine guidance sensors fgs are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate astrometry measurements accurate to within 00003 arcseconds have been achieved60 the space telescope science institute stsci is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers stsci is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy aura and is physically located in baltimore maryland on the homewood campus of johns hopkins university one of the 39 us universities and seven international affiliates that make up the aura consortium stsci was established in 19816162 after something of a power struggle between nasa and the scientific community at large nasa had wanted to keep this function inhouse but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment6364 the space telescope european coordinating facility stecf established at garching bei mnchen near munich in 1984 provided similar support for european astronomers until 2011 when these activities were moved to the european space astronomy centre65 one complex task that falls to stsci is scheduling observations for the telescope66 hubble is in a lowearth orbit to enable servicing missions which results in most astronomical targets being occulted by the earth for slightly less than half of each orbit observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the south atlantic anomaly due to elevated radiation levels and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the sun precluding observations of mercury moon and earth the solar avoidance angle is about 50 to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the ota earth and moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the fgss and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments if the fgss are turned off the moon and earth can be observed earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flatfields for the wfpc1 instrument there is a socalled continuous viewing zone cvz within roughly 24 of hubbles orbital poles in which targets are not occulted for long periods676869 due to the precession of the orbit the location of the cvz moves slowly over a period of eight weeks because the limb of the earth is always within about 30 of regions within the cvz the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during cvz observations hubble orbits in low earth orbit at an altitude of approximately 540 kilometers 340 mi and an inclination of 2855 the position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable the density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors and this means hubbles predicted position for six weeks time could be in error by up to 4000 km 2500 mi observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed70 engineering support for hst is provided by nasa and contractor personnel at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland 48 km 30 mi south of the stsci hubbles operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up hubbles flight operations team66 by january 1986 the planned launch date for hubble that october looked feasible but the challenger disaster brought the us space program to a halt grounded the shuttle fleet and forced the launch to be postponed for several years during this delay the telescope was kept in a clean room powered up and purged with nitrogen until a launch could be rescheduled this costly situation about 6 million per month pushed the overall costs of the project higher however this delay allowed time for engineers to perform extensive tests swap out a possibly failureprone battery and make other improvements71 furthermore the ground software needed to control hubble was not ready in 1986 and was barely ready by the 1990 launch72 following the resumption of shuttle flights space shuttle discovery successfully launched the hubble on april 24 1990 as part of the sts31 mission73 at launch nasa had spent approximately 47 billion in inflationadjusted 2010 dollars on the project74 hubbles cumulative costs are estimated to be about 113 billion in 2015 dollars which include all subsequent servicing costs but not ongoing operations making it the most expensive science mission in nasa history75 hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time plus the fine guidance sensors which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for scientific astrometry measurements early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the shuttle servicing missions costar was a corrective optics device rather than a science instrument but occupied one of the four axial instrument bays since the final servicing mission in 2009 the four active instruments have been acs cos stis and wfc3 nicmos is kept in hibernation but may be revived if wfc3 were to fail in the future of the former instruments three costar fos and wfpc2 are displayed in the smithsonian national air and space museum767778 the foc is in the dornier museum germany79 the hsp is in the space place at the university of wisconsinmadison80 the first wfpc was dismantled and some components were then reused in wfc38182 within weeks of the launch of the telescope the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of groundbased telescopes hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond instead of having a point spread function psf concentrated within a circle 01 arcseconds 485 nrad in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria8384 analysis of the flawed images revealed that the primary mirror had been polished to the wrong shape although it was believed to be one of the most precisely figured optical mirrors ever made smooth to about 10 nanometers34 the outer perimeter was too flat by about 2200 nanometers about 1450 mm or 111000 inch85 this difference was catastrophic introducing severe spherical aberration a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center86 the effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation the core of the aberrated psf was sharp enough to permit highresolution observations of bright objects and spectroscopy of point sources was affected only through a sensitivity loss however the loss of light to the large outoffocus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or highcontrast imaging this meant nearly all the cosmological programs were essentially impossible since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects86 this led politicians to question nasas competence scientists to rue the cost which could have gone to more productive endeavors and comedians to make jokes about nasa and the telescope in the 1991 comedy the naked gun 2 the smell of fear in a scene where historical disasters are displayed hubble is pictured with the titanic and the hindenburg8788 nonetheless during the first three years of the hubble mission before the optical corrections the telescope carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets89 the error was well characterized and stable enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution90 a commission headed by lew allen director of the jet propulsion laboratory was established to determine how the error could have arisen the allen commission found that a reflective null corrector a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped nonspherical mirror had been incorrectly assembled one lens was out of position by 13 mm 0051 in91 during the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror perkinelmer analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors however for the final manufacturing step figuring they switched to the custombuilt reflective null corrector designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances the incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape during fabrication a few tests using conventional null correctors correctly reported spherical aberration but these results were dismissed thus missing the opportunity to catch the error because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate92 the commission blamed the failings primarily on perkinelmer relations between nasa and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns nasa found that perkinelmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately did not assign its best optical scientists to the project as it had for the prototype and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror while the commission heavily criticized perkinelmer for these managerial failings nasa was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument93 many feared that hubble would be abandoned94 the design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission scheduled for 1993 while kodak had ground a backup mirror for hubble it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit and too expensive and timeconsuming to bring the telescope back to earth for a refit instead the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission effectively acting as spectacles to correct the spherical aberration9596 the first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror working backwards from images of point sources astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was 10139000002 instead of the intended 1002309798 the same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by perkinelmer to figure the mirror as well as by analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror99 because of the way the hsts instruments were designed two different sets of correctors were required the design of the wide field and planetary camera 2 already planned to replace the existing wfpc included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate chargecoupled device ccd chips making up its two cameras an inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary however the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be configured in this way and so required an external correction device100 the corrective optics space telescope axial replacement costar system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the foc fos and ghrs it consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration101 to fit the costar system onto the telescope one of the other instruments had to be removed and astronomers selected the high speed photometer to be sacrificed100 by 2002 all the original instruments requiring costar had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics102 costar was then removed and returned to earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the national air and space museum in washington dc103 the area previously used by costar is now occupied by the cosmic origins spectrograph104 hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit instruments and limited life items were designed as orbital replacement units105 five servicing missions sm 1 2 3a 3b and 4 were flown by nasa space shuttles the first in december 1993 and the last in may 2009106 servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttles mechanical arm the necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered spacewalks over a period of four to five days after a visual inspection of the telescope astronauts conducted repairs replaced failed or degraded components upgraded equipment and installed new instruments once work was completed the telescope was redeployed typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the orbital decay caused by atmospheric drag107 the first hubble servicing mission was scheduled for 1993 before the mirror problem was discovered it assumed greater importance as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics failure would have resulted in either abandoning hubble or accepting its permanent disability other components failed before the mission causing the repair cost to rise to 500 million not including the cost of the shuttle flight a successful repair would help demonstrate the viability of building space station alpha108 sts49 in 1992 demonstrated the difficulty of space work while its rescue of intelsat 603 received praise the astronauts had taken possibly reckless risks in doing so neither the rescue nor the unrelated assembly of prototype space station components occurred as the astronauts had trained causing nasa to reassess planning and training including for the hubble repair the agency assigned to the mission story musgrave who had worked on satellite repair procedures since 1976 and six other experienced astronauts including two from sts49 the first mission director since project apolloclarification needed would coordinate a crew with 16 previous shuttle flights the astronauts were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools109 heat had been the problem on prior spacewalks which occurred in sunlight hubble needed to be repaired out of sunlight musgrave discovered during vacuum training seven months before the mission that spacesuit gloves did not sufficiently protect against the cold of space after sts57 confirmed the issue in orbit nasa quickly changed equipment procedures and flight plan seven total mission simulations occurred before launch the most thorough preparation in shuttle history no complete hubble mockup existed so the astronauts studied many separate models including one at the smithsonian and mentally combined their varying and contradictory details110 service mission 1 flew aboard endeavour in december 1993 and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days most importantly the high speed photometer was replaced with the costar corrective optics package and wfpc was replaced with the wide field and planetary camera 2 wfpc2 with an internal optical correction system the solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system two electrical control units and other electrical components and two magnetometers the onboard computers were upgraded with added coprocessors and hubbles orbit was boosted85 on january 13 1994 nasa declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images111 the mission was one of the most complex performed to that date involving five long extravehicular activity periods its success was a boon for nasa as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope77112 servicing mission 2 flown by discovery in february 1997 replaced the ghrs and the fos with the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis and the near infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer nicmos replaced an engineering and science tape recorder with a new solid state recorder and repaired thermal insulation113 nicmos contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument but shortly after it was installed an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle this led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 45 years to about two years114 servicing mission 3a flown by discovery took place in december 1999 and was a splitoff from servicing mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed the fourth failed a few weeks before the mission rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations the mission replaced all six gyroscopes replaced a fine guidance sensor and the computer installed a voltagetemperature improvement kit vik to prevent battery overcharging and replaced thermal insulation blankets115 servicing mission 3b flown by columbia in march 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument with the foc which except for the fine guidance sensors when used for astrometry was the last of the original instruments being replaced by the advanced camera for surveys acs this meant costar was no longer required since all new instruments had builtin correction for the main mirror aberration102 the mission also revived nicmos by installing a closedcycle cooler114 and replaced the solar arrays for the second time providing 30 percent more power116 plans called for hubble to be serviced in february 2005 but the columbia disaster in 2003 in which the orbiter disintegrated on reentry into the atmosphere had wideranging effects to the hubble program and other nasa missions nasa administrator sean okeefe decided all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of the international space station should inflight problems develop as no shuttles were capable of reaching both hst and the space station during the same mission future crewed service missions were canceled117 this decision was criticized by numerous astronomers who felt hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk118 hsts planned successor the james webb space telescope jwst by 2004 was not expected to launch until at least 2011 jwst was eventually launched in december 2021119 a gap in spaceobserving capabilities between a decommissioning of hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers given the significant scientific impact of hst120 the consideration that jwst will not be located in low earth orbit and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure only made concerns more acute on the other hand nasa officials were concerned that continuing to service hubble would consume funds from other programs and delay the jwst121 in january 2004 okeefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to hst due to public outcry and requests from congress for nasa to look for a way to save it the national academy of sciences convened an official panel which recommended in july 2004 that the hst should be preserved despite the apparent risks their report urged nasa should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the hubble space telescope122 in august 2004 okeefe asked goddard space flight center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission these plans were later canceled the robotic mission being described as not feasible123 in late 2004 several congressional members led by senator barbara mikulski held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support including thousands of letters from school children across the us to get the bush administration and nasa to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a hubble rescue mission124 the nomination in april 2005 of a new nasa administrator michael d griffin changed the situation as griffin stated he would consider a crewed servicing mission125 soon after his appointment griffin authorized goddard to proceed with preparations for a crewed hubble maintenance flight saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions in october 2006 griffin gave the final goahead and the 11day mission by atlantis was scheduled for october 2008 hubbles main datahandling unit failed in september 2008126 halting all reporting of scientific data until its backup was brought online on october 25 2008127 since a failure of the backup unit would leave the hst helpless the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit126 servicing mission 4 sm4 flown by atlantis in may 2009 was the last scheduled shuttle mission for hst104128 sm4 installed the replacement datahandling unit repaired the acs and stis systems installed improved nickelhydrogen batteries and replaced other components including all six gyroscopes sm4 also installed two new observation instruments wide field camera 3 wfc3 and the cosmic origins spectrograph cos129 and the soft capture and rendezvous system which will enable the future rendezvous capture and safe disposal of hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission130 except for the acss high resolution channel which could not be repaired and was disabled131132133 the work accomplished during sm4 rendered the telescope fully functional104 since the start of the program a number of research projects have been carried out some of them almost solely with hubble others coordinated facilities such as chandra xray observatory and esos very large telescope although the hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life there are still major projects scheduled for it one example is the current 2022 ullyses project ultraviolet legacy library of young stars as essential standards which will last for three years to observe a set of high and lowmass young stars and will shed light on star formation and composition another is the opal project outer planet atmospheres legacy which is focussed on understanding the evolution and dynamics of the atmosphere of the outer planets such as jupiter and uranus by making baseline observations over an extended period134 in an august 2013 press release candels was referred to as the largest project in the history of hubble the survey aims to explore galactic evolution in the early universe and the first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the big bang135 the candels project site describes the surveys goals as the following136 the cosmic assembly nearir deep extragalactic legacy survey is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution from z 8 to 15 via deep imaging of more than 250000 galaxies with wfc3ir and acs it will also find the first type ia sne beyond z 15 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology five premier multiwavelength sky regions are selected each has multiwavelength data from spitzer and other facilities and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies the use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 109 solar masses out to z 8 the program officially named hubble deep fields initiative 2012 is aimed to advance the knowledge of early galaxy formation by studying highredshift galaxies in blank fields with the help of gravitational lensing to see the faintest galaxies in the distant universe137 the frontier fields web page describes the goals of the program being the cosmic evolution survey cosmos139 is an astronomical survey designed to probe the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of both cosmic time redshift and the local galaxy environment the survey covers a two square degree equatorial field with spectroscopy and xray to radio imaging by most of the major spacebased telescopes and a number of large ground based telescopes140 making it a key focus region of extragalactic astrophysics cosmos was launched in 2006 as the largest project pursued by the hubble space telescope at the time and still is the largest continuous area of sky covered for the purposes of mapping deep space in blank fields 25 times the area of the moon on the sky and 17 times larger than the largest of the candels regions the cosmos scientific collaboration that was forged from the initial cosmos survey is the largest and longestrunning extragalactic collaboration known for its collegiality and openness the study of galaxies in their environment can be done only with large areas of the sky larger than a half square degree141 more than two million galaxies are detected spanning 90 of the age of the universe the cosmos collaboration is led by caitlin casey jeyhan kartaltepe and vernesa smolcic and involves more than 200 scientists in a dozen countries139 the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble clash was a treasury program from 2010 to 2013 conducted by the hubble space telescope to observe 25 massive galaxy clusters by using gravitational lensing clash aimed to examine the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in massive galaxy clusters with the new instruments installed in 2009 imagery showing the effects of gravitational lensing is one means of detecting dark matter and dark energy and clash focused on trying to gain a better understanding of both mysterious topics142 the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury and panchromatic hubble andromeda southern treasury phat and phast were observations done by hubble from july 2010 to october 2013 to map the northern half of the andromeda galaxy and from december 2021 to january 2024 to map the southern half andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to the milky way galaxy and hubble created the highest resolution and most detailed photomosaic ever of andromeda two hundred million stars can be seen in this combined image of both treasury programs out of a total one trillion stars in andromeda each star looks like a grain of sand the northern half phat was mapped in nearultraviolet visible and nearinfrared wavelengths in 828 orbits and was released in january 2015 the southern half phast was mapped in nearultraviolet and visible wavelengths in 195 orbits and was released in january 2025 observing andromeda in this detail is the best alternative to observing the milky way galaxy because earth is within the milky way and cannot observe most of the milky way due to the galaxy itself blocking observations of 20 of the sky and most of the galaxy to achieve this mosaic 1023 hubble orbits were needed the mosaic image is made up of at least 25 billion pixels144145146147 anyone can apply for time on the telescope there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation but funding for analysis is available only to us institutions148 competition for time on the telescope is intense with about onefifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule149150 calls for proposals are issued roughly annually with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year proposals are divided into several categories general observer proposals are the most common covering routine observations snapshot observations are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time including overheads such as acquiring the target snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular general observer programs151 astronomers may make target of opportunity proposals in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle in addition up to 10 of the telescope time is designated directors discretionary dd time astronomers can apply to use dd time at any time of year and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae152 other uses of dd time have included the observations that led to views of the hubble deep field and hubble ultra deep field and in the first four cycles of telescope time observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers153154 in 2012 the esa held a contest for public image processing of hubble data to encourage the discovery of hidden treasures in the raw hubble data155156 the first director of stsci riccardo giacconi announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope the total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers153154 proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit did not duplicate proposals made by professionals and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997153 one such study was transition comets uv search for oh the first proposal a hubble space telescope study of posteclipse brightening and albedo changes on io was published in icarus157 a journal devoted to solar system studies a second study from another group of amateurs was also published in icarus158 after that time however budget reductions at stsci made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable and no additional amateur programs have been carried out153154 regular hubble proposals still include findings or discovered objects by amateurs and citizen scientists these observations are often in a collaboration with professional astronomers one of the earliest such observations is the great white spot of 1990159 on planet saturn discovered by amateur astronomer s wilber160 and observed by hst under a proposal by j westphal caltech161162 later professionalamateur observations by hubble include discoveries by the galaxy zoo project such as voorwerpjes and green pea galaxies163164 the gems of the galaxies program is based on a list of objects by galaxy zoo volunteers that was shortened with the help of an online vote165 additionally there are observations of minor planets discovered by amateur astronomers such as 2iborisov and changes in the atmosphere of the gas giants jupiter and saturn or the ice giants uranus and neptune166167 in the proam collaboration backyard worlds the hst was used to observe a planetary mass object called wise j08302837 the nondetection by the hst helped to classify this peculiar object168 in the early 1980s nasa and stsci convened four panels to discuss key projects these were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time which would be explicitly dedicated to each project this guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early in case the telescope failed sooner than expected the panels identified three such projects 1 a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies169 2 a medium deep survey using the wide field camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used170 and 3 a project to determine the hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors both external and internal in the calibration of the distance scale171 hubble has helped resolve some longstanding problems in astronomy while also raising new questions some results have required new theories to explain them among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before and thus constrain the value of the hubble constant the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding which is also related to its age before the launch of hst estimates of the hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50 but hubble measurements of cepheid variables in the virgo cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of 10 which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since hubbles launch using other techniques172 the estimated age of the universe is now 137 billion years before the hubble telescope it was ten to twenty billion173 astronomers from the highz supernova search team and the supernova cosmology project used groundbased telescopes and hst to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that far from decelerating under the influence of gravity the expansion of the universe is instead accelerating three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded nobel prizes for their discovery174 the cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood175 the term used for the currentlyunknown cause is dark energy signifying that it is dark unable to be directly seen and detected to our current scientific instruments176 the highresolution spectra and images provided by the hst have been especially wellsuited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the center of nearby galaxies while it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates work conducted with hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies177 the hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related178179 a unique window on the universe enabled by hubble are the hubble deep field hubble ultradeep field and hubble extreme deep field images which used hubbles unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths the images reveal galaxies billions of light years away thereby providing information about the early universe and have accordingly generated a wealth of scientific papers the wide field camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered such as macs0647jd180 the nonstandard object scp 06f6 was discovered by the hubble space telescope in february 2006181182 on march 3 2016 researchers using hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest confirmed galaxy to date gnz11 which hubble observed as it existed roughly 400 million years after the big bang183 the hubble observations occurred on february 11 2015 and april 3 2015 as part of the candelsgoodsnorth surveys184185 the collision of comet shoemakerlevy 9 with jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers coming just a few months after servicing mission 1 had restored hubbles optical performance hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of voyager 2 in 1979 and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a large comet with jupiter an event believed to occur once every few centuries186 in march 2015 researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around ganymede one of jupiters moons revealed that it has a subsurface ocean using hubble to study the motion of its aurorae the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between jupiters magnetic field and that of ganymede the ocean is estimated to be 100 km 60 mi deep trapped beneath a 150 km 90 mi ice crust187188 hst has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the solar system including the dwarf planets pluto189 eris190 and sedna191 during june and july 2012 us astronomers using hubble discovered styx a tiny fifth moon orbiting pluto192 from june to august 2015 hubble was used to search for a kuiper belt object kbo target for the new horizons kuiper belt extended mission kem when similar searches with ground telescopes failed to find a suitable target193 this resulted in the discovery of at least five new kbos including the eventual kem target 486958 arrokoth that new horizons performed a close flyby of on january 1 2019194195196 in april 2022 nasa announced that astronomers were able to use images from hst to determine the size of the nucleus of comet c2014 un271 bernardinellibernstein which is the largest icy comet nucleus ever seen by astronomers the nucleus of c2014 un271 has an estimated mass of fifty trillion tons which is fifty times the mass of other known comets in the solar system197 on december 11 2015 hubble captured an image of the firstever predicted reappearance of a supernova dubbed refsdal which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is warping the supernovas light the supernova was previously seen in november 2014 behind galaxy cluster macs j114952223 as part of hubbles frontier fields program the light from the cluster took roughly five billion years to reach earth while the light from the supernova behind it took five billion more years than that as measured by their respective redshifts because of the gravitational effect of the galaxy cluster four images of the supernova appeared instead of one an example of an einstein cross based on early lens models a fifth image was predicted to reappear by the end of 2015199 refsdal reappeared as predicted in 2015200 in march 2019 observations from hubble and data from the european space agencys gaia space observatory were combined to determine that the mass of the milky way galaxy is approximately 15 trillion times the mass of the sun a value intermediate between prior estimates201 other discoveries made with hubble data include protoplanetary disks proplyds in the orion nebula202 evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around sunlike stars203 and the optical counterparts of the stillmysterious gammaray bursts204 using gravitational lensing hubble observed a galaxy designated macs 21291 approximately ten billion lightyears from earth macs 21291 subverted expectations about galaxies in which new star formation had ceased a significant result for understanding the formation of elliptical galaxies205 in 2022 hubble detected the light of the farthest individual star ever seen to date the star whl0137ls nicknamed earendel existed within the first billion years after the big bang it will be observed by nasas james webb space telescope to confirm earendel is indeed a star206 many objective measures show the positive impact of hubble data on astronomy as of 2025 over 22000 papers based on hubble data have been published in peerreviewed journals207 and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings looking at papers several years after their publication about onethird of all astronomy papers have no citations while only two percent of papers based on hubble data have no citations on average a paper based on hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on nonhubble data of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations about 10 are based on hubble data208 although the hst has clearly helped astronomical research its financial cost has been large a study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on hst data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m 13 ft groundbased telescope such as the william herschel telescope the hst costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain209 deciding between building ground versus spacebased telescopes is complex even before hubble was launched specialized groundbased techniques such as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higherresolution optical and infrared images than hubble would achieve though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by hubble210211 since then advances in adaptive optics have extended the highresolution imaging capabilities of groundbased telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects the usefulness of adaptive optics versus hst observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked in the visible bands adaptive optics can correct only a relatively small field of view whereas hst can conduct highresolution optical imaging over a wider field212 moreover hubble can image more faint objects since groundbased telescopes are affected by the background of scattered light created by the earths atmosphere213 in addition to its scientific results hubble has also made significant contributions to aerospace engineering in particular the performance of systems in low earth orbit leo these insights result from hubbles long lifetime on orbit extensive instrumentation and return of assemblies to the earth where they can be studied in detail in particular hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing radiation damage to electronics and sensors and the long term behavior of multilayer insulation214 one lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion gyroscopes are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen215 another is that optical surfaces in leo can have surprisingly long lifetimes hubble was only expected to last 15 years before the mirror became unusable but after 14 years there was no measureable degradation118 finally hubble servicing missions particularly those that serviced components not designed for inspace maintenance have contributed towards the development of new tools and techniques for onorbit repair216 hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft when launched the storage facilities were oldfashioned reeltoreel tape drives but these were replaced by solid state data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3a about twice daily the hubble space telescope radios data to a satellite in the geosynchronous tracking and data relay satellite system tdrss which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60foot 18meter diameter highgain microwave antennas located at the white sands test facility in white sands new mexico150 from there they are sent to the space telescope operations control center at goddard space flight center and finally to the space telescope science institute for archiving150 each week hst downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data2 all images from hubble are monochromatic grayscale taken through a variety of filters each passing specific wavelengths of light and incorporated in each camera color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters this process can also create falsecolor versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue218219 all hubble data is eventually made available via the mikulski archive for space telescopes at stsci220 cadc221 and esaesac222 data is usually proprietary available only to the principal investigator pi and astronomers designated by the pi for twelve months after being taken the pi can apply to the director of the stsci to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances223 observations made on directors discretionary time are exempt from the proprietary period and are released to the public immediately calibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away all data in the archive is in the fits format which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use224 the hubble heritage project processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in jpeg and tiff formats225 astronomical data taken with ccds must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis stsci has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available this onthefly processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned the process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as pipeline reduction and is increasingly common at major observatories astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally this may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used226 hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages stsci maintains the custommade space telescope science data analysis system stsdas software which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files as well as many other astronomical image processing tools tailored to the requirements of hubble data the software runs as a module of iraf a popular astronomical data reduction program227 nasa considered it important for the space telescope to capture the publics imagination given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs228 after the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented hubbles reputation with the public the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images77229 several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about hubble activities in the united states outreach efforts are coordinated by the space telescope science institute stsci office for public outreach which was established in 2000 to ensure that us taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program to that end stsci operates the hubblesiteorg website the hubble heritage project operating out of the stsci provides the public with highquality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed the heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy and emphasizes the aesthetic nature of hubble images the heritage project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which for scientific reasons may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a fullcolor image225 since 1999 the leading hubble outreach group in europe has been the hubble european space agency information centre heic230 this office was established at the space telescope european coordinating facility in munich germany heics mission is to fulfill hst outreach and education tasks for the european space agency the work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting hubble results and images these are often european in origin and so increase awareness of both esas hubble share 15 and the contribution of european scientists to the observatory esa produces educational material including a videocast series called hubblecast designed to share worldclass scientific news with the public231 the hubble space telescope has won two space achievement awards from the space foundation for its outreach activities in 2001 and 2010232 a replica of the hubble space telescope is displayed on the courthouse lawn in marshfield missouri the hometown of namesake edwin p hubble233 the hubble space telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on april 24 2010 to commemorate the occasion nasa esa and the space telescope science institute stsci released an image from the carina nebula234 to commemorate hubbles 25th anniversary in space on april 24 2015 stsci released images of the westerlund 2 cluster located about 20000 lightyears 6100 pc away in the constellation carina through its hubble 25 website235 the european space agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website236 in april 2016 a special celebratory image of the bubble nebula was released for hubbles 26th birthday237 hst uses gyroscopes to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets hst has six of these ratesensing gyroscopes installed three gyroscopes are normally required for operation observations are still possible with two or one but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult238 in 2018 the plan was to drop into onegyroscope mode if fewer than three working gyroscopes were operational the gyroscopes are part of the pointing control system which uses five types of sensors magnetic sensors optical sensors and the gyroscopes and two types of actuators reaction wheels and magnetic torquers47 after the columbia disaster in 2003 it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible and gyroscope life became a concern again so engineers developed new software for twogyroscope and onegyroscope modes to maximize the potential lifetime the development was successful and in 2005 it was decided to switch to twogyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission the switch to this mode was made in august 2005 leaving hubble with two gyroscopes in use two on backup and two inoperable239 one more gyroscope failed in 2007240 by the time of the final repair mission in may 2009 during which all six gyroscopes were replaced with two new pairs and one refurbished pair only three were still working engineers determined that the gyroscope failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygenpressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid215 the new gyroscope models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen215 and were expected to be much more reliable241 in the 2009 servicing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced and after almost ten years only three gyroscopes failed and only after exceeding the average expected run time for the design242 of the six gyroscopes replaced in 2009 three were of the old design susceptible for flexlead failure and three were of the new design with a longer expected lifetime the first of the oldstyle gyroscopes failed in march 2014 and the second in april 2018 on october 5 2018 the last of the oldstyle gyroscopes failed and one of the newstyle gyroscopes was poweredup from standby state however that reserve gyroscope did not immediately perform within operational limits and so the observatory was placed into safe mode while scientists attempted to fix the problem243244 nasa tweeted on october 22 2018 that the rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range additional tests are to be performed to ensure hubble can return to science operations with this gyro245 the solution that restored the backup newstyle gyroscope to operational range was widely reported as turning it off and on again246 a running restart of the gyroscope was performed but this had no effect and the final resolution to the failure was more complex the failure was attributed to an inconsistency in the fluid surrounding the float within the gyroscope ie an air bubble on october 18 2018 the hubble operations team directed the spacecraft into a series of maneuvers moving it in opposite directions in order to mitigate the inconsistency only after the maneuvers and a subsequent set of maneuvers on october 19 did the gyroscope truly operate within its normal range247 past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones avoiding failure and making new types of science possible without servicing missions all the instruments will eventually fail in august 2004 the power system of the space telescope imaging spectrograph stis failed rendering the instrument inoperable the electronics had originally been fully redundant but the first set of electronics failed in may 2001248 this power supply was fixed during servicing mission 4 in may 2009249 similarly the advanced camera for surveys acs main camera primary electronics failed in june 2006 and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on january 27 2007250 only the instruments solar blind channel sbc was operable using the side1 electronics a new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during sm 4 but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel251 the wide field channel wfc was returned to service by sts125 in may 2009 but the high resolution channel hrc remains offline252 on january 8 2019 hubble entered a partial safe mode following suspected hardware problems in its most advanced instrument the wide field camera 3 instrument nasa later reported that the cause of the safe mode within the instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range on january 15 2019 nasa said the cause of the failure was a software problem engineering data within the telemetry circuits were not accurate in addition all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue after resetting the telemetry circuits and associated boards the instrument began functioning again on january 17 2019 the device was returned to normal operation and on the same day it completed its first science observations253254 on june 13 2021 hubbles payload computer halted due to a suspected issue with a memory module an attempt to restart the computer on june 14 failed further attempts to switch to one of three other backup memory modules on board the spacecraft failed on june 18 on june 23 and 24 nasa engineers switched hubble to a backup payload computer but these operations have failed as well with the same error on june 28 2021 nasa announced that it was extending the investigation to other components255256 scientific operations were suspended while nasa worked to diagnose and resolve the issue257258 after identifying a malfunctioning power control unit pcu supplying power to one of hubbles computers nasa was able to switch to a backup pcu and bring hubble back to operational mode on july 16259260261262 on october 23 2021 hst instruments reported missing synchronization messages263 and went into safe mode264 by december 8 2021 nasa had restored full science operations and was developing updates to make instruments more resilient to missing synchronization messages265 hubble orbits the earth in the extremely tenuous upper atmosphere and over time its orbit decays due to drag if not reboosted it will reenter the earths atmosphere within some decades with the exact date depending on how active the sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere if hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled reentry parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities266 in 2013 deputy project manager james jeletic projected that hubble could survive into the 2020s4 based on solar activity and atmospheric drag or lack thereof a natural atmospheric reentry for hubble will occur between 2028 and 20404267 in june 2016 nasa extended the service contract for hubble until june 2021268 in november 2021 nasa extended the service contract for hubble until june 2026269 nasas original plan for safely deorbiting hubble was to retrieve it using a space shuttle hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the smithsonian institution this is no longer possible since the space shuttle fleet has been retired and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew instead nasa considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled reentry270 ultimately in 2009 as part of servicing mission 4 the last servicing mission by the space shuttle nasa installed the soft capture mechanism scm to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission the scm together with the relative navigation system rns mounted on the shuttle to collect data to enable nasa to pursue numerous options for the safe deorbit of hubble constitute the soft capture and rendezvous system scrs130271 as of 2017update the trump administration was considering a proposal by the sierra nevada corporation to use a crewed version of its dream chaser spacecraft to service hubble some time in the 2020s as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in the james webb space telescope272 in 2020 john grunsfeld said that spacex crew dragon or orion could perform another repair mission within ten years while robotic technology is not yet sophisticated enough he said with another crewed visit we could keep hubble going for another few decades with new gyros and instruments273 billionaire private astronaut jared isaacman proposed to fund a servicing mission using spacex spacecraft though it might save nasa much money spacex and nasa differed on the missions risk274 in september 2022 nasa and spacex signed a space act agreement to investigate the possibility of launching a crew dragon mission to service and boost hubble to a higher orbit possibly extending its lifespan by another 20 years275 this mission could have been the second of the polaris program but by june 2024 nasa had rejected a private servicing mission because of potential damage to the observatory276277278 there is no direct replacement to hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope because nearterm space telescopes do not duplicate hubbles wavelength coverage nearultraviolet to nearinfrared wavelengths instead concentrating on the further infrared bands these bands are preferred for studying high redshift and lowtemperature objects objects generally older and farther away in the universe these wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground justifying the expense of a spacebased telescope large groundbased telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as hubble sometimes challenge hst in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics ao have much larger lightgathering power and can be upgraded more easily but cannot yet match hubbles excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space212213 plans for a hubble successor materialized as the next generation space telescope project which culminated in plans for the james webb space telescope jwst the formal successor of hubble279 very different from a scaledup hubble it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the earth at the l2 lagrangian point where thermal and optical interference from the earth and moon are lessened it is not engineered to be fully serviceable such as replaceable instruments but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft280 a main scientific goal of jwst is to observe the most distant objects in the universe beyond the reach of existing instruments it is expected to detect stars in the early universe approximately 280 million years older than stars hst now detects281 the telescope is an international collaboration between nasa the european space agency and the canadian space agency since 1996282 and was launched on december 25 2021 on an ariane 5 rocket283 although jwst is primarily an infrared instrument its coverage extends down to 600 nm wavelength light or roughly orange in the visible spectrum a typical human eye can see to about 750 nm wavelength light so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands including orange and red light284 a complementary telescope looking at even longer wavelengths than hubble or jwst was the european space agencys herschel space observatory launched on may 14 2009 like jwst herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch and had a mirror substantially larger than hubbles but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter it needed helium coolant of which it ran out on april 29 2013285 further concepts for advanced 21stcentury space telescopes include the large ultraviolet optical infrared surveyor luvoir287 a conceptualized 8 to 168 meters 310 to 660 inches optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to hst with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths with substantially better resolution than hubble or the spitzer space telescope the final planning report prepared for the 2020 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey suggested a launch date of 2039288 the decadal survey eventually recommended that ideas for luvoir be combined with the habitable exoplanet observer proposal to devise a new 6meter flagship telescope that could launch in the 2040s289 existing groundbased telescopes and various proposed extremely large telescopes can exceed the hst in terms of sheer lightgathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors but other factors affect telescopes in some cases they may be able to match or exceed hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics ao however ao on large groundbased reflectors will not make hubble and other space telescopes obsolete most ao systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field lucky cam for example produces crisp images just 10 to 20 arcseconds wide whereas hubbles cameras produce crisp images across a 150arcsecond 2 arcminutes field furthermore space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum most of which is blocked by earths atmosphere finally the background sky is darker in space than on the ground because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night producing a faint but discernible airglow that washes out lowcontrast astronomical objects290
