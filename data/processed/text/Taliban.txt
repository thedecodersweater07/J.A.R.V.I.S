largely consisted of students from the pashtun areas of east and south afghanistan who had been educated in traditional islamic schools madris under the leadership of mullah omar r 19962001 the movement spread through most of afghanistan shifting power away from the mujahideen warlords in 1996 the group established the first islamic emirate of afghanistan the talibans government was opposed by the northern alliance militia which seized parts of northeast afghanistan and maintained international recognition as a continuation of the islamic state of afghanistan during their rule from 1996 to 2001 the taliban enforced a strict interpretation of sharia or islamic law87 and were widely condemned for massacres against afghan civilians harsh discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities denial of un food supplies to starving civilians destruction of cultural monuments banning women from school and most employment and prohibition of most music88 the taliban committed a cultural genocide against afghans by destroying their historical and cultural texts artifacts and sculptures89 the taliban held control of most of the country until the united states invasion of

guardians banning female speech and banning all education for girls90919293 as of 2025 only russia has granted the taliban government diplomatic recognition94 the word taliban is pashto libn meaning students the plural of lib this is a loanword from arabic lib using the pashto plural ending n 95 in arabic libn means not students but rather two students as it is a dual form the arabic plural being ullboccasionally causing some confusion to arabic speakers since becoming a loanword in english taliban besides a plural noun referring to the group has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual for example john walker lindh has been referred to as an american taliban rather than an american talib in domestic media this is different in afghanistan where a member or a supporter of the group is referred to as a talib or its plural talibha in other definitions taliban means seekers96 in english the spelling taliban has gained predominance over the spelling taleban9798 in american english the definite article is used the group is referred to as the taliban rather than taliban in englishlanguage media in pakistan the definite article is always omitted99 both pakistani and indian englishlanguage media tend to name the group afghan taliban100101 thus distinguishing it from the pakistani taliban additionally in pakistan the word talibans is often used when referring to more than one taliban member in afghanistan the taliban is frequently called the gorohe taleban a dari term which means taliban group102 as per daripersian grammar there is no the prefix meanwhile in pashto a determiner is normally used and as a result the group is normally referred to as per pashto grammar da taliban or da talibano after the soviet union intervened and occupied afghanistan in 1979 islamic mujahideen fighters waged a war against soviet forces during the sovietafghan war nearly all of the talibans original leaders had fought for either the hezbi islami khalis or the harakati inqilabe islami factions of the mujahideen103 pakistans president muhammad ziaulhaq feared that the soviets were also planning to invade balochistan pakistan so he sent akhtar abdur rahman to saudi arabia to garner support for the afghan resistance against soviet occupation forces a while later the us cia and the saudi arabian general intelligence directorate gid funnelled funding and equipment through the pakistani interservice intelligence agency isi to the afghan mujahideen104 about 90000 afghans including mullah omar were trained by pakistans isi during the 1980s104 in april 1992 after the fall of the sovietbacked rgime of mohammad najibullah many afghan political parties agreed on a peace and powersharing agreement the peshawar accord which created the islamic state of afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period gulbuddin hekmatyars hezbe islami gulbuddin hezbe wahdat and ittihadi islami did not participate the state was paralysed from the start due to rival groups contending for total power over kabul and afghanistan105better source needed hekmatyars hezbe islami gulbuddin party refused to recognise the interim government and in april infiltrated kabul to take power for itself thus starting this civil war in may hekmatyar started attacks against government forces and kabul106 hekmatyar received operational financial and military support from pakistans isi107 with that help hekmatyars forces were able to destroy half of kabul108 iran assisted the hezbe wahdat forces of abdulali mazari saudi arabia supported the ittihadi islami faction106108109 the conflict between these militias also escalated into war due to this sudden initiation of civil war working government departments police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created islamic state of afghanistan did not have time to form atrocities were committed by individuals inside different factions110 ceasefires negotiated by representatives of the islamic states newly appointed defense minister ahmad shah massoud president sibghatullah mojaddedi and later president burhanuddin rabbani the interim government or officials from the international committee of the red cross icrc commonly collapsed within days106 the countryside in northern afghanistan parts of which were under the control of defense minister massoud remained calm and some reconstruction took place the city of herat under the rule of islamic state ally ismail khan also witnessed relative calmcitation needed meanwhile southern afghanistan was neither under the control of foreignbacked militias nor the government in kabul but was ruled by local leaders such as gul agha sherzai and their militias the taliban movement originated in pashtun nationalism and its ideological underpinnings are with that of broader afghan society the talibans roots lie in the religious schools of kandahar and were influenced significantly by foreign support particularly from pakistan and saudi arabia during the sovietafghan war they emerged in afghanistan in the mid1990s capturing kandahar and expanding their control across the country they became involved in a war with the northern alliance the international response to the taliban varied with some countries providing support while others opposed and did not recognize their regime during their rule from 1996 to 2001 the taliban implemented strict religious regulations notably affecting womens rights and cultural heritage this period included significant ethnic persecution and the destruction of the buddhas of bamiyan after the usled invasion in 2001 the taliban were ousted from power but regrouped and launched an insurgency that lasted two decades the taliban returned to power in 2021 following the us withdrawal their efforts to establish the islamic emirate of afghanistan continue with education policies and international relations including internal and external challenges faced by the taliban regime in mid 2021 the taliban led a major offensive in afghanistan during the withdrawal of us troops from the country which gave them control of over half of afghanistans 421 districts as of 23 july 2021111112 by midaugust 2021 the taliban controlled every major city in afghanistan following the near seizure of the capital kabul the taliban occupied the presidential palace after the incumbent president ashraf ghani fled afghanistan to the united arab emirates113114 ghanis asylum was confirmed by the uae ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation on 18 august 2021115116 remaining afghan forces under the leadership of amrullah saleh ahmad massoud and bismillah khan mohammadi retreated to panjshir to continue resistance117118119 the taliban had seized power from an established government backed by some of the worlds bestequipped militaries and as an ideological insurgent movement dedicated to bringing about a truly islamic state its victory has been compared to that of the chinese communist revolution in 1949 or iranian revolution of 1979 with their sweeping remake of society however as of 20212022 senior taliban leaders have emphasized the softness of their revolution and how they desired good relations with the united states in discussions with american journalist jon lee anderson88 anderson notes that the talibans war against any graven images so vigorous in their early rule has been abandoned perhaps made impossible by smartphones and instagram one local observer sayed hamid gailani has argued the taliban have not killed a lot of people after returning to power women are seen out on the street zabihullah mujahid acting deputy minister of information and culture noted there are still women working in a number of government ministries and claimed that girls will be allowed to attend secondary education when bank funds are unfrozen and the government can fund separate spaces and transportation for them88 when asked about the slaughter of hazara shia by the first taliban rgime suhail shaheen the taliban nominee for ambassador to the un told anderson the hazara shia for us are also muslim we believe we are one like flowers in a garden88 in late 2021 journalists from the new york times embedded with a sixman taliban unit tasked with protecting the shiite sakhi shrine in kabul from the islamic state noting how seriously the men appeared to take their assignment the units commander said that we do not care which ethnic group we serve our goal is to serve and provide security for afghans120 in response to international criticism over lack of diversity an ethnic hazara was appointed deputy health minister and an ethnic tajik appointed deputy trade minister88 on the other hand the ministry of womens affairs has been closed and its building is the new home of ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice according to anderson some women still employed by the government are being forced to sign in at their jobs and then go home to create the illusion of equity and the appointment of ethnic minorities has been dismissed by an adviser to the taliban as tokenism88 reports have circulated of hazara farmers being forced from their land by ethnic pashtuns of raids of activists homes and of extrajudicial executions of former government soldiers and intelligence agents88 according to a human rights watchs report released in november 2021 the taliban killed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former members of the afghan security forces in the three months since the takeover in just the four provinces of ghazni helmand kandahar and kunduz according to the report the taliban identified targets for arrest and execution through intelligence operations and access to employment records that were left behind former members of the security forces were also killed by the taliban within days of registering with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety121 despite taliban claims that the isis has been defeated is carried out suicide bombings in october 2021 at shia mosques in kunduz and kandahar killing over 115 people as of late 2021 there were still sticky bomb explosions every few days in the capital kabul88 explanations for the relative moderation of the new taliban government and statements from its officials such as we have started a new page we do not want to be entangled with the past88 include that it did not expect to take over the country so quickly and still had problems to work out among their factions88 that 7 billion in afghan government funds in us banks has been frozen and that the 80 of the previous governments budget that came from the united states its partners or international lenders has been shut off creating serious economic crisis according to the un world food program country director mary ellen mcgroarty as of late 2021 early 2022 228 million afghans are already severely food insecure and seven million of them are one step away from famine and that the world community has unanimously asked the taliban to form an inclusive government ensure the rights of women and minorities and guarantee that afghanistan will no more serve as the launching pad for global terrorist operations before it recognizes the taliban government122 in conversation with journalist anderson senior taliban leaders implied that the harsh application of sharia during their first era of rule in the 1990s was necessary because of the depravity and chaos that remained from the soviet occupation but that now mercy and compassion were the order of the day88 this was contradicted by former senior members of the ministry of womens affairs one of which who told anderson they will do anything to convince the international community to give them financing but eventually ill be forced to wear the burqa again they are just waiting88 after taliban retook power in 2021 border clashes erupted between the taliban with its neighbors includes iran and pakistan leading to casualties on both sides123124 in the early months of taliban rule international journalists have had some access to afghanistan in february 2022 several international journalists including andrew north were detained the committee to protect journalists described their detention as a sad reflection of the overall decline of press freedom and increasing attacks on journalists under taliban rule125 the journalists were released after several days126 subsequently watchdog organizations have continued to document a number of arrests of local journalists as well as barring access to international journalists127 the countrys small community of sikhs who form afghanistans second largest religion128 as well as hindus have reportedly been prevented from celebrating their holidays as of 2023 by the taliban government129 despite this the taliban in a later statement praised the communities and assured that their private land and property will be secured130 in april 2024 the former sole sikh member of parliament narendra singh khalsa returned to afghanistan for the first time since the collapse of the republic130 in september 2021 the government ordered primary schools to reopen for both sexes and announced plans to reopen secondary schools for male students without committing to do the same for female students131 while the taliban stated that female college students will be able to resume higher education provided that they are segregated from male students and professors when possible132 the guardian noted that if the high schools do not reopen for girls the commitments to allow university education would become meaningless once the current cohort of students graduated131 higher education minister abdul baqi haqqani said that female university students will be required to observe proper hijab but did not specify if this required covering the face132 kabul university reopened in february 2022 with female students attending in the morning and males in the afternoon other than the closure of the music department few changes to the curriculum were reported133 female students were officially required to wear an abaya and a hijab to attend although some wore a shawl instead attendance was reportedly low on the first day134 in march 2022 the taliban abruptly halted plans to allow girls to resume secondary school education even when separated from males135 at the time the washington post reported that apart from university students sixth is now the highest grade girls may attend the afghan ministry of education cited the lack of an acceptable design for female student uniforms136 on 20 december 2022 in violation of their prior promises the taliban banned female students from attending higher education institutions with immediate effect137138139 the following day 21 december 2022 the taliban instituted a ban on all education for all girls and women around the country alongside a ban on female staff in schools including teaching professions teaching was one of the last few remaining professions open to women140 the talibans ideology has been described as an innovative form of sharia combining pashtun tribal codes141 or pashtunwali with radical deobandi interpretations of islam favoured by jamiat ulemaeislam and its splinter groups142 their ideology was a departure from the islamism of the antisoviet mujahideen rulersclarification needed and the radical islamistsclarification needed inspired by the sayyid qutb ikhwan143 the taliban have said they aim to restore peace and security to afghanistan including western troops leaving and to enforce sharia or islamic law once in power144145146 according to journalist ahmed rashid at least in the first years of their rule the taliban adopted deobandi and islamist antinationalist beliefs and they opposed tribal and feudal structures removing traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles147 the taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like herat kabul and kandahar but in rural areas the taliban had little direct control and as a result they promoted village jirgas so in rural areas they did not enforce their ideology as stringently as they enforced it in cities148 the talibans religiouspolitical philosophy especially during its first rgime from 1996 to 2001 was heavily advised and influenced by grand mufti rashid ahmed ludhianvi and his works its operating political and religious principles since its founding however were modeled on those of abul ala maududi and the jamaateislami movement149 the taliban being largely pashtun tribespeople frequently follow a preislamic cultural tribal code that is focused on preserving honor pashtunwali strongly influences decisions regarding other social matters it is best described as subconscious social values and attitudes promoting various qualities such as bravery preserving honor being hospitable to all guests seeking revenge and justice if one has been wronged and providing sanctuary to anyone who seeks refuge even an enemy however nonpashtuns and others usually criticize some of the values such as the pashtun practice of equally dividing inheritances among sons even though the quran clearly states that women are supposed to receive onehalf of a mans share150151 according to ali a jalali and lester grau the taliban received extensive support from pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance even pashtun intellectuals in the west who differed with the taliban on many issues expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds152 written works published by the groups commission of cultural affairs including islami adalat de mujahid toorah de jihad shari misalay and guidance to the mujahideen outlined the core of the taliban islamic movements philosophy regarding jihad sharia organization and conduct153 the taliban rgime interpreted the sharia law in accordance with the hanafi school of islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of mullah omar87 the taliban mullah omar in particular emphasised dreams as a means of revelation154155 the taliban forbade the consumption of pork and alcohol the use of many types of consumer technology such as music with instrumental accompaniments156 television156 filming156 and the internet as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography156 participation in sports157 including football and chess157 recreational activities such as kiteflying and the keeping of pigeons and other pets were also forbidden and the birds were killed according to the talibans rules157 movie theatres were closed and repurposed as mosques157 the celebration of the western and iranian new years was also forbidden158 taking photographs and displaying pictures and portraits were also banned because the taliban considered them forms of idolatry157 this extended even to blacking out illustrations on packages of baby soap in shops and painting over roadcrossing signs for livestock88 women were banned from working159 girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities159 were required to observe purdah physical separation of the sexes and awrah concealing the body with clothing and to be accompanied by male relatives outside their households those who violated these restrictions were punished159 men were forbidden to shave their beards and they were also required to let them grow and keep them long according to the talibans rules and they were also required to wear turbans outside their households160161 prayer was made compulsory those men who did not respect the religious obligation after the azaan were arrested160 gambling was banned158 and the taliban punished thieves by amputating their hands or feet157 in 2000 the talibans leader mullah omar officially banned opium cultivation and drug trafficking in afghanistan162163164 the taliban succeeded in nearly eradicating the majority of the opium production 99 by 2001163164165 during the talibans governance of afghanistan drug users and dealers were both severely persecuted162 in 1999 mullah omar issued a decree in which he called for the protection of the buddha statues at bamyan two 6thcentury monumental statues of standing buddhas which were carved into the side of a cliff in the bamyan valley in the hazarajat region of central afghanistan but in march 2001 the taliban destroyed the statues following a decree by mullah omar which stated all the statues around afghanistan must be destroyed166 yahya massoud brother of the antitaliban and resistance leader ahmad shah massoud recalls the following incident after the destruction of the buddha statues at bamyan it was the spring of 2001 i was in afghanistans panjshir valley together with my brother ahmad shah massoud the leader of the afghan resistance against the taliban and bismillah khan who currently serves as afghanistans interior minister one of our commanders commandant momin wanted us to see 30 taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle my brother agreed to meet them i remember that his first question concerned the centuriesold buddha statues that were dynamited by the taliban in march of that year shortly before our encounter two taliban combatants from kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed my brother looked at them and said this time in pashto there are still many sun worshippers in this country will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the earth167 the afghan custom of bacha bazi a form of pederastic sexual slavery child sexual abuse and pedophilia which is traditionally practiced in various provinces of afghanistan between older men and young adolescent dancing boys was also forbidden under the sixyear rule of the taliban rgime168 under the rule of the islamic emirate of afghanistan it carried the death penalty169170 the practice remained illegal during the islamic republic of afghanistans rule but the laws were seldom enforced against powerful offenders and police had reportedly been complicit in related crimes171172173174 a controversy arose during the islamic republic of afghanistans rule after allegations surfaced that us government forces in afghanistan after the invasion of the country deliberately ignored bacha bazi175 the us military responded by claiming the abuse was largely the responsibility of the local afghan government176 the taliban has criticized the us role in the abuse of afghan children unlike other islamic fundamentalist organizations the taliban are not salafists although wealthy arab nations had brought salafist madrasas to afghanistan during the soviet war in the 1980s the talibans strict deobandi leadership suppressed the salafi movement in afghanistan after it first came to power in the 1990s following the 2001 us invasion the taliban and salafists joined forces to wage a common war against nato forces still salafists were relegated to small groups which were under the talibans command177 the taliban are averse to debating doctrine with other muslims and did not allow even muslim reporters to question their edicts or to discuss interpretations of the quran178 following the taliban victory a nationwide campaign was launched against influential salafi factions suspected of past ties to the isisk the taliban closed most salafi mosques and seminaries in 16 provinces including nangarhar and detained clerics it accused of supporting the islamic state179180 during the period of the first taliban rule 1996 to 2001 the taliban attempted to sway shias particularly hazaras to their side making deals with a number of shia political figures as well as securing the support of some shia religious scholars181 one of these was ustad muhammad akbari a shia hazara politician who separated from abdulali mazaris islamic unity party to form the national islamic unity party thereafter politically aligning himself and his group which gained the support of the majority of islamic unity party members in the hazara hinterland182 with the taliban183 another significant shia political figure in the administration of the first islamic emirate was sayed gardizi a seyyed hazara from gardez who was appointed as the wuluswal district governor of yakawlang district being the only shia to hold the position of district governor during the period of the first islamic emirate of afghanistan184 at the same time however certain incidents caused distrust between the taliban and afghan shias the 1998 mazarisharif massacre was the most significant having taken place in response to ethnic uzbek warlord abdul rashid dostums betrayal and subsequent massacre of taliban fighters as well as false rumors that hazaras had beheaded senior taliban leader mawlawi ihsanullah ihsan at the grave of abdulali mazari which led to the massacre of a significant number of hazaras185 the commander responsible for the massacre abdulmanan niazi later became notable for his opposition to the talibans leadership having formed the rebellious high council of the islamic emirate of afghanistan in 2015 before being killed reportedly by the taliban themselves186181 the desire of the taliban leadership to expand the groups relations with afghan shias continued after the american invasion of afghanistan and the groups return to insurgency some time following the american invasion of iraq in 2003 the taliban published a message to the mujahid people of iraq and afghanistan by mullah omar in which he condemned sectarianism whilst jointly addressing the people of iraq and afghanistan saying187 its incumbent upon all muslims to thwart all the cursed plots of the cunning enemy and to not give him the opportunity to light the fires of disagreement amongst the muslims a major component of american policy is to categorize the muslims in iraq with the labels of shah and sunn and in afghanistan with the labels of pashtun tjk hazrah and uzbek in order to decrease the severity and strength of the popular uprisings and the accompanying armed resistance as such i request the brothers in iraq to put behind them the differences that exist in the name of shah and sunn and to fight in unity against the occupying enemy for victory is not possible without unity multiple hazara shia taliban commanders took part in the taliban insurgency primarily from bamyan and daikundi provinces among the qarabaghi tribe of shia hazaras a number of fighters voluntarily joined the taliban due to their close relations with the nearby talibansupporting sunni pashtun population additionally a progovernment shia hazara militia from gizab district of daikundi province called fedayi defected and pledged allegiance to the taliban a few years before 2016 with a reported size of 50 fighters188 in reaction to the 2011 afghanistan ashura bombings which targeted shia afghans in kabul and mazarisharif the taliban published sectarian killings a dangerous enemy conspiracy by taliban official abdul qahar balkhi in which he stated189 in afghanistan sunnis and shias have coexisted for centuries they live communal lives and participate in their mutual festivities and for centuries they have fought shoulder to shoulder against foreign invaders the majority of shia populations in bamyan daikundi and hazarajat have actively aided and continue to support the mujahideen against the foreigners and their puppets the foreign occupiers seek to ignite the flames of communal hatred and violence between sunnis and shias in afghanistan the followers of islam will only ever reclaim their rightful place in this world if they forgo their petty differences and unite as a single egalitarian body in recent years the taliban have once again attempted to court shiites appointing a shia cleric as a regional governor and recruiting hazaras to fight against isisk in order to distance themselves from their past reputation and improve their relations with the shialed government of iran190 after the 2021 taliban offensive which led to the restoration of the islamic emirate senior taliban officials including deputy prime minister abdul salam hanafi and foreign minister amir khan muttaqi have stressed the importance of unity between shiites and sunnis in afghanistan and promised to protect the shiite community191 the ministry of virtue and vice have also agreed to hire shia ulama in order to implement the ministrys religious edicts192 in general the taliban has maintained peace with most muslims in the shiite community193194 although the 2022 balkhab uprising resulted in the deaths of some hazaras195 the talibans ideology is not static before its capture of kabul members of the taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of good muslims took power and once law and order were restored the decisionmaking process of the taliban in kandahar was modelled on the pashtun tribal council jirga together with what was believed to be the early islamic model discussion was followed by the building of a consensus by the believers196 as the talibans power grew mullah omar made decisions without consulting the jirga or visiting other parts of the country he visited the capital kabul only twice while in power taliban spokesman mullah wakil explained decisions are based on the advice of the amirul momineen for us consultation is not necessary we believe that this is in line with the sharia we abide by the amirs view even if he alone takes this view there will not be a head of state instead there will be an amir almuminin mullah omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree general elections are incompatible with sharia and therefore we reject them197 another sign that the talibans ideology was evolving was mullah omars 1999 decree in which he called for the protection of the buddha statues at bamyan and the destruction of them in 2001198 the author ahmed rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship which resulted from the soviet invasion and the period which followed it influenced the talibans ideology199 it is said that the taliban did not include scholars who were learned in islamic law and history the refugee students brought up in a totally male society had no education in mathematics science history or geography no traditional skills of farming herding or handicraftmaking or even knowledge of their tribal and clan lineages199 in such an environment war meant employment peace meant unemployment dominating women affirmed manhood for their leadership rigid fundamentalism was a matter of principle and political survival taliban leaders repeatedly told rashid that if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school they would lose the support of their rank and file200 the taliban have been criticized for their strictness towards those who disobeyed their imposed rules and mullah omar has been criticized for titling himself amir almuminin mullah omar was criticized for calling himself amir almuminin because he lacked scholarly learning tribal pedigree or connections to the prophets family the sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the countrys ulema whereas only some 1200 pashtun talibansupporting mullahs had declared that omar was the amir according to ahmed rashid no afghan had adopted the title since 1834 when king dost mohammed khan assumed the title before he declared jihad against the sikh kingdom in peshawar but dost mohammed was fighting foreigners while omar had declared jihad against other afghans204 another criticism was that the taliban called their 20 tax on truckloads of opium zakat which is traditionally limited to 25 of the zakat payers disposable income or wealth204 the taliban have been compared to the 7thcentury kharijites who developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream sunni and shia muslims the kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir whereby they declared that other muslims were unbelievers and deemed them worthy of death205206207 in particular the taliban have been accused of takfir towards shia after the august 1998 slaughter of 8000 mostly shia hazara noncombatants in mazarisharif mullah abdul manan niazi the taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of mazar who the taliban later killed after forming the rebellious high council of the islamic emirate186 declared from mazars central mosque last year you rebelled against us and killed us from all your homes you shot at us now we are here to deal with you the hazaras are not muslims and now have to kill hazaras you either accept to be muslims or leave afghanistan wherever you go we will catch you if you go up we will pull you down by your feet if you hide below we will pull you up by your hair208 carter malkasian in one of the first comprehensive historical works on the afghan war argues that the taliban are oversimplified in most portrayals while malkasian thinks that oppressive remains the best word to describe them he points out that the taliban managed to do what multiple governments and political players failed to bring order and unity to the ungovernable land the taliban curbed the atrocities and excesses of the warlord period of the civil war from 19921996 malkasian further argues that the talibans imposing of islamic ideals upon the afghan tribal system was innovative and a key reason for their success and durability given that traditional sources of authority had been shown to be weak during the long period of civil war only religion had proved decisive in afghanistan in a period of 40 years of constant conflict the traditionalist islam of the taliban proved to be far more stable even if the order they brought was an impoverished peace209 5051 the taliban have been internationally condemned for their harsh enforcement of their interpretation of islamic sharia law which has resulted in their brutal treatment of many afghans during their rule from 1996 to 2001 the taliban enforced a strict interpretation of sharia or islamic law87 the taliban and their allies committed massacres against afghan civilians denied un food supplies to 160000 starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes while the taliban controlled afghanistan they banned activities and media including paintings photography and movies that depicted people or other living things they also prohibited music with instrumental accompaniments with the exception of the daf a type of frame drum210 the taliban prevented girls and young women from attending school banned women from working jobs outside of healthcare male doctors were prohibited from treating women and required that women be accompanied by a male relative and wear a burqa at all times when in public if women broke certain rules they were publicly whipped or executed211 the taliban harshly discriminated against religious and ethnic minorities during their rule and they have also committed a cultural genocide against the people of afghanistan by destroying numerous monuments including the famous 1500yearold buddhas of bamiyan according to the united nations the taliban and their allies were responsible for 76 of afghan civilian casualties in 2010 and 80 in 2011 and 2012212 the group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin213214 extortion and kidnapping for ransom215216 they also seized control of mining operations in the mid2010s that were illegal under the previous government217 according to a 55page report by the united nations the taliban while trying to consolidate control over northern and western afghanistan committed systematic massacres against civilians un officials stated that there had been 15 massacres between 1996 and 2001 they also said that these have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the taliban ministry of defense or to mullah omar himself these are the same type of war crimes as were committed in bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts one un official was quoted as saying the documents also reveal the role of arab and pakistani support troops in these killings bin ladens socalled 055 brigade was responsible for masskillings of afghan civilians the report by the united nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people the talibans former ambassador to pakistan mullah abdul salam zaeef in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the taliban had been necessary218219220221 in 1998 the united nations accused the taliban of denying emergency food by the uns world food programme to 160000 hungry and starving people for political and military reasons222 the un said the taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war223224225226227 on 8 august 1998 the taliban launched an attack on mazarisharif of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement once in control the taliban began to kill people indiscriminately at first shooting people in the street they soon began to target hazaras women were raped and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate this ethnic cleansing left an estimated 5000 to 6000 people dead at this time ten iranian diplomats and a journalist were killed iran assumed the taliban had murdered them and mobilised its army deploying men along the border with afghanistan by the middle of september there were 250000 iranian personnel stationed on the border pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to tehran towards the end of the month the killings of the diplomats had been carried out by sipahesahaba pakistan a pakistani sunni group with close ties to the isi they burned orchards crops and destroyed irrigation systems and forced more than 100000 people from their homes with hundreds of men women and children still unaccounted for228229230231232 in a major effort to retake the shomali plains to the north of kabul from the united front the taliban indiscriminately killed civilians while uprooting and expelling the population among others kamal hossein a special reporter for the un reported on these and other war crimes in istalif a town famous for handmade potteries and which was home to more than 45000 people the taliban gave 24 hours notice to the population to leave then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute233234 in 1999 the town of bamian was taken hundreds of men women and children were executed houses were razed and some were used for forced labour there was a further massacre at the town of yakaolang in january 2001 an estimated 300 people were murdered along with two delegations of hazara elders who had tried to intercede235236 by 1999 the taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the shomali plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes farm land and gardens233 several taliban and alqaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking abducting ethnic minority women and selling them into sex slavery in afghanistan and pakistan237 time magazine writes the taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex the behavior of the taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in afghanistan made a mockery of that claim237 the targets for human trafficking were especially women from the tajik uzbek hazara and other nonpashtun ethnic groups in afghanistan some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery killing themselves during one taliban and alqaeda offensive in 1999 in the shomali plains alone more than 600 women were kidnapped237 arab and pakistani alqaeda militants with local taliban forces forced them into trucks and buses237 time magazine writes the trail of the missing shomali women leads to jalalabad not far from the pakistan border there according to eyewitnesses the women were penned up inside sar shahi camp in the desert the more desirable among them were selected and taken away some were trucked to peshawar with the apparent complicity of pakistani border guards others were taken to khost where bin laden had several training camps officials from relief agencies say the trail of many of the vanished women leads to pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves237 to phrs knowledge no other rgime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment239 physicians for human rights 1998 brutal repression of women was widespread under the taliban and it received significant international condemnation240241242243244245246247248249 abuses were myriad and violently enforced by the religious police250 for example the taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated forcing girls to leave schools and colleges251252253218219254255233 women who were leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa256 a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see251252 those women who were accused of disobedience were publicly beaten in one instance a young woman named sohaila was charged with adultery after she was caught walking with a man who was not a relative she was publicly flogged in ghazi stadium receiving 100 lashes257 female employment was restricted to the medical sector where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls251258259 this extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools as almost all teachers prior to the talibans rise had been women further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys restrictions became especially severe after the taliban took control of the capital in february 1998 for instance religious police forced all women off the streets of kabul and issued new regulations which ordered people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside260 in december 2024 the talibans health ministry banned women from being trained in nursing and midwifery according to media reports confirmed by the guardian261 this was a reversal of an earlier february 2024 decision to permit basic medical training for women262 according to npr the health ministry had lobbied for an exemption from the general ban on womens education in the healthcare sector because in some provinces the taliban does not allow women to seek treatment from male medical professionals262 the talibans ban on basic medical training for women was widely condemned by human rights organizations as a danger to the health and wellbeing of afghan women and children with afghanistan already having among the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world according to 2020 data before the talibans 2021 seizure of power261262 for example heather barr of human right watch stated if you ban women from being treated by male healthcare professionals and then you ban women from training to become healthcare professionals the consequences are clear women will not have access to healthcare and will die as a result261 the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights ohchr stated that the ban is profoundly discriminatory shortsighted and puts the lives of women and girls at risk in multiple ways263 in july 2025 the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for taliban leaders over their alleged persecution of women in afghanistan264 according to the united nations the taliban and its allies were responsible for 76 of civilian casualties in afghanistan in 2009 75 in 2010 and 80 in 2011225265 according to human rights watch the talibans bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties sharply escalated in 2006 when at least 669 afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at noncombatants266267 the united nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the taliban and progovernment forces in the war rose nearly 50 between 2007 and 2009 the high number of civilians killed by the taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of improvised explosive devices ieds for instance 16 ieds have been planted in girls schools by the taliban268 in 2009 colonel richard kemp formerly commander of british forces in afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the british government drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of hamas in gaza to those of the taliban kemp wrote like hamas in gaza the taliban in southern afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection women and children are trained and equipped to fight collect intelligence and ferry arms and ammunition between battles female suicide bombers are increasingly common the use of women to shield gunmen as they engage nato forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment schools and houses are routinely boobytrapped snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children269270 richard kemp commander of british forces in afghanistan hindus and sikhs have lived in afghanistan since historic times and they were prominent minorities in afghanistan wellestablished in terms of academics and businesses271 after the afghan civil war they started to migrate to india and other nations272 after the taliban established the islamic emirate of afghanistan they imposed strict sharia laws which discriminated against hindus and sikhs and caused the size of afghanistans hindu and sikh populations to fall at a very rapid rate because they emigrated from afghanistan and established diasporas in the western world273 the taliban issued decrees that forbade nonmuslims from building places of worship but allowed them to worship at existing holy sites forbade nonmuslims from criticizing muslims ordered nonmuslims to identify their houses by placing a yellow cloth on their rooftops forbade nonmuslims from living in the same residence as muslims and required that nonmuslim women wear a yellow dress with a special mark so that muslims could keep their distance from them hindus and sikhs were mainly targeted274 the taliban announced in may 2001 that it would force afghanistans hindu population to wear special badges which has been compared to the treatment of jews in nazi germany275 in general the taliban treated the sikhs better than afghan shiites hindus and christians276 along with hindus the small christian community was also persecuted by the taliban277 violence against western aid workers and christians was common during the afghan conflict278 on several occasions between 2008 and 2012 the taliban claimed that they assassinated western and afghani medical or aid workers in afghanistan because they feared that the polio vaccine would make muslim children sterile because they suspected that the medical workers were really spies or because they suspected that the medical workers were proselytizing christianity in august 2008 three western women british canadian us who were working for the aid group international rescue committee were murdered in kabul the taliban claimed that they killed them because they were foreign spies279 in october 2008 the british woman gayle williams working for christian uk charity serve afghanistan focusing on training and education for disabled persons was murdered near kabul taliban claimed they killed her because her organisation was preaching christianity in afghanistan279 in all 2008 until october 29 aid workers 5 of whom nonafghanis were killed in afghanistan279 in august 2010 the taliban claimed that they murdered 10 medical aid workers while they were passing through badakhshan province on their way from kabul to nuristan province but the afghan islamic partymilitia hezbe islami gulbuddin has also claimed responsibility for those killings the victims were six americans one briton one german and two afghanis working for a selfproclaimed nonprofit christian organization which is named international assistance mission the taliban stated that they murdered them because they were proselytizing christianity and possessing which were translated into the dari language when they were encountered iam contended that they were not missionaries280 in december 2012 unidentified gunmen killed four female un polioworkers in karachi in pakistan the western news media suggested that there was a connection between the outspokenness of the taliban and objections to and suspicions of such polio vaccinations281 eventually in 2012 a pakistani taliban commander in north waziristan in pakistan banned polio vaccinations282 and in march 2013 the afghan government was forced to suspend its vaccination efforts in nuristan province because the taliban was extremely influential in the province283 however in may 2013 the talibans leaders changed their stance on polio vaccinations saying that the vaccine is the only way to prevent polio and they also stated that they will work with immunization volunteers as long as polio workers are unbiased and harmonized with the regional conditions islamic values and local cultural traditions284285 during the first period of taliban rule only two known jews were left in afghanistan zablon simintov and isaac levy c 19202005 levy relied on charity to survive while simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001 they lived on opposite sides of the dilapidated kabul synagogue they kept denouncing each other to the authorities and both spent time in jail for continuously arguing the taliban also confiscated the synagogues torah scroll however the two men were later released from prison when taliban officials became annoyed by their arguing286 after august 2021 the last jew simintov and his relative left afghanistan ended centuries of jewish presence in the country287288 before the taliban came to power education was highly regarded in afghanistan and kabul university attracted students from asia and the middle east however the taliban imposed restrictions on modern education banned the education of females only allowed islamic religious schools to stay open and only encouraged the teaching of the quran around half of all of the schools in afghanistan were destroyed289 the taliban have carried out brutal attacks on teachers and students and they have also threatened parents and teachers290 as per a 1998 unicef report 9 out of 10 girls and 2 out of 3 boys did not enroll in schools by 2000 fewer than 45 of all afghan children were being educated at the primary school level and even fewer of them were being educated at higher secondary and university levels289 attacks on educational institutions students and teachers and the forced enforcement of islamic teachings have even continued after the taliban were deposed from power in december 2017 united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reported that over 1000 schools had been destroyed damaged or occupied and 100 teachers and students had been killed by the taliban291 the taliban have committed a cultural genocide against the afghan people by destroying their historical and cultural texts artifacts and sculptures89 in the early 1990s the national museum of afghanistan was attacked and looted numerous times resulting in the loss of 70 of the 100000 artifacts of afghan culture and history which were then on display292 on 11 august 1998 the taliban destroyed the puli khumri public library the library contained a collection of over 55000 books and old manuscripts one of the most valuable and beautiful collections of afghanistans cultural works according to the afghan people293294 on 2 march 2001 the buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite on orders from the talibans leader mullah omar295 in october of the same year the taliban took sledgehammers and axes to thousands of years worth of artifacts88 in the national museum of afghanistan destroying at least 2750 ancient works of art296 afghanistan has a rich musical culture where music plays an important part in social functions like births and marriages and it has also played a major role in uniting an ethnically diverse country297 however since it came to power and even after it was deposed the taliban has banned most music including cultural folk music and it has also attacked and killed a number of musicians297298299300 during their first rule of afghanistan which lasted from 1996 to 2001 the taliban banned many recreational activities and games such as association football kite flying and chess mediums of entertainment such as televisions cinemas music with instrumental accompaniments vcrs and satellite dishes were also banned301 also included on the list of banned items were musical instruments and accessories and all visual representation of living creatures297302303304 however the daf a type of frame drum wasnt banned210 it was reported that when afghan children were caught kiting a highly popular activity they were beaten305 when khaled hosseini learned through a 1999 news report that the taliban had banned kite flying a restriction he found particularly cruel the news struck a personal chord for him as he had grown up with the sport while living in afghanistan hosseini was motivated to write a 25page short story about two boys who fly kites in kabul that he later developed into his first novel the kite runner according to the testimony of guantanamo captives before their combatant status review tribunals the taliban in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers also conscripted men to staff its civil service both done at gunpoint306307308 according to a report from oxford university the taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997 1998 and 1999309 the report states that during the civil war that preceded the taliban rgime thousands of orphaned boys joined various militia for employment food shelter protection and economic opportunity the report said that during its initial period the taliban long depended upon cohorts of youth witnesses stated that each landowning family had to provide one young man and 500 in expenses in august of that year 5000 students aged between 15 and 35 left madrassas in pakistan to join the taliban according to jon lee anderson the taliban government is said to be profoundly divided between the kandahar faction and the haqqani network with a mysterious dispearance of deputy prime minister abdul ghani baradar for several days in midseptember 2021 explained by rumours of injury after a brawl with other taliban88 the kandahar faction is named for the city that mullah omar came from and where he founded the taliban and is described as insular and rural interested primarily with ruling its home turf it includes haibatullah akhundzada mullah yaqoob abdul ghani baradar see below the familybased haqqani network by contrast are closely linked to pakistans secret services interested in global jihad with its founder jalaluddin haqqani connected the taliban with osama bin laden88 it is named for its founder jalaluddin haqqani and is currently led by sirajuddin haqqani and includes khalil haqqani mawlawi mohammad salim saad88 with sirajuddin haqqani as acting interior minister as of february 2022 the network has control of a preponderance of security positions in afghanistan88 taliban leadership have denied tension between factions suhail shaheen states there is one taliban and zabihullah mujahid acting deputy minister of information and culture even maintains there is no haqqani network88 the top members of the taliban as an insurgency as of august 2021 are310 all the top leadership of the taliban are ethnic pashtuns more specifically those belonging of the ghilzai confederation311 until his death in 2013 mullah omar was the supreme commander of the taliban mullah akhtar mansour was elected as his replacement in 2015312 and following mansours killing in a may 2016 us drone strike mawlawi hibatullah akhundzada became the groups leader313 the taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from afghans weary of the warlords corruption brutality and incessant fighting314 this popularity was not universal particularly among nonpashtuns in 2001 the taliban de jure controlled 85 of afghanistan de facto the areas under its direct control were mainly afghanistans major cities and highways tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns villages and rural areas315 rashid described the taliban government as a secret society run by kandaharis mysterious secretive and dictatorial316 they did not hold elections as their spokesman explained the sharia does not allow politics or political parties that is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers just food clothes shoes and weapons we want to live a life like the prophet lived 1400 years ago and jihad is our right we want to recreate the time of the prophet and we are only carrying out what the afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years317 they modelled their decisionmaking process on the pashtun tribal council jirga together with what they believed to be the early islamic model discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the believers196 before capturing kabul there was talk of stepping aside once a government of good muslims took power and law and order were restored as the talibans power grew decisions were made by mullah omar without consulting the jirga and without consulting other parts of the country he visited the capital kabul only twice while in power instead of an election their leaders legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance bayah in imitation of the prophet and the first four caliphs on 4 april 1996 mullah omar had the cloak of the prophet mohammed taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years wrapping himself in the relic he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of kandahar while hundreds of pashtun mullahs below shouted amir almuminin commander of the faithful in a pledge of support taliban spokesman mullah wakil explained decisions are based on the advice of the amirul momineen for us consultation is not necessary we believe that this is in line with the sharia we abide by the amirs view even if he alone takes this view there will not be a head of state instead there will be an amir almuminin mullah omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree general elections are incompatible with sharia and therefore we reject them197 the taliban were very reluctant to share power and since their ranks were overwhelmingly pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60 of afghans from other ethnic groups in local government such as kabul city council316 or herat318 taliban loyalists not locals dominated even when the pashtospeaking taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke dari or other nonpashtun tongues318 critics complained that this lack of local representation in urban administration made the taliban appear as an occupying force319 consistent with the governance of the early muslims was the absence of state institutions and the absence of a methodology for command and control both of which are standard today even in nonwesternized states the taliban did not issue press releases or policy statements nor did they hold regular press conferences the basis for this structure was grand mufti rashid ahmed ludhianvis obedience to the amir as he served as a mentor to the talibans leadership320 the outside world and most afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like because photography was banned321 the regular army resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal militia force with only 25000 men of whom 11000 were nonafghans cabinet ministers and deputies were mullahs with a madrasah education several of them such as the minister of health and the governor of the state bank were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts and fought whenever they were needed military reverses that trapped them behind enemy lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration322 at the national level all senior tajik uzbek and hazara bureaucrats were replaced with pashtuns whether qualified or not consequently the ministries by and large ceased to function319 the ministry of finance did not have a budget nor did it have a qualified economist or banker mullah omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping the kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the taliban occupation 1996 but the afghani soon fell in value they imposed a 50 tax on any company operating in the country and those who failed to pay were attacked they also imposed a 6 import tax on anything brought into the country and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade by 2001 the per capita income of the 25 million population was under 200 and the country was close to total economic collapse as of 2007 the economy had begun to recover with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13 increase in economic growth246323324325326327 under the transit treaty between afghanistan and pakistan a massive network for smuggling developed it had an estimated turnover of 25 billion dollars with the taliban receiving between 100 and 130 million per year these operations along with the trade from the golden crescent financed the war in afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in pakistan ahmed rashid also explained that the afghan transit trade agreed on by pakistan was the largest official source of revenue for the taliban328329330 between 1996 and 1999 mullah omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade apparently as it only harmed kafirs the taliban controlled 96 of afghanistans poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of taliban income and their war economy according to rashid drug money funded the weapons ammunition and fuel for the war in the new york times the finance minister of the united front wahidullah sabawoon declared the taliban had no annual budget but that they appeared to spend us300 million a year nearly all of it on war he added that the taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money poppy the pakistanis and bin laden330 in an economic sense it seems he had little choice as the war of attrition continued with the northern alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation by 2000 afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75 of the worlds supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82171 hectares at this juncture omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1685 hectares many observers say the ban which came in a bid for international recognition at the united nations was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest the trafficking of accumulated stocks by the taliban continued in 2000 and 2001 in 2002 the un mentioned the existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests in september 2001 before the 11 september attacks against the united states the taliban allegedly authorised afghan peasants to sow opium again330331332333 there was also an environmental toll to the country heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in kunar province and paktya being cleared throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the pakistani markets with no attempt made at reforestation which has led to significant environmental damage by 2001 when the afghan interim administration took power the countrys infrastructure was in ruins telecommunications had failed the road network was destroyed and ministry of finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse on 6 july 1999 then president bill clinton signed into effect executive order 13129 this order implemented a complete ban on any trade between america and the taliban rgime and on 10 august they froze 5000000 in ariana assets on 19 december 2000 un resolution 1333 was passed it called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the taliban this included the offices of ariana afghan airlines in 1999 the un had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions334335336337338339340341 according to the lawsuit filed in december 2019 in the dc district court on behalf of gold star families some us defense contractors involved in afghanistan made illegal protection payments to the taliban funding a talibanled terrorist insurgency that killed or wounded thousands of americans in afghanistan342343 in 2009 thensecretary of state hillary clinton said that the protection money was one of the major sources of funding for the taliban344 it is estimated that in 2020 the taliban had an income of 16 billion mostly from drugs mining extortion and taxes donations and exports216 on 2 november 2021 the taliban required that all economic transactions in afghanistan use afghanis and banned the use of all foreign currency345346347 in 2022 construction on the qosh tepa canal began in northern afghanistan348 on 20 april 2024 the taliban decided to abolish afghanistans pension system as hibatullah akhundzada claimed it was unislamic which prompted protests by retirees and older veterans of the afghan armed forces in kabul the protest was dispersed by the taliban349 during the war the taliban were supported by several militant outfits which include the haqqani network alqaeda and the islamic movement of uzbekistan several countries like china iran pakistan qatar russia and saudi arabia allegedly support the talibancitation needed however all of their governments deny providing any support to the taliban likewise the taliban also deny receiving any foreign support from any country350 at its peak formal diplomatic recognition of the talibans government was acknowledged by three nations pakistan saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in the past the united arab emirates and turkmenistan were also alleged to have provided support to the taliban it is designated by some countries as a terrorist organization during its time in power 19962001 at its height ruling 90 of afghanistan the taliban rgime or islamic emirate of afghanistan gained diplomatic recognition from only three states the united arab emirates pakistan and saudi arabia all of which provided substantial aid the most other nations and organizations including the united nations recognised the government of the islamic state of afghanistan 19922002 parts of whom were part of the united front also called northern alliance as the legitimate government of afghanistan regarding its relations with the rest of the world the talibans emirate of afghanistan held a policy of isolationism the taliban believe in noninterference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their countrys internal affairs351 traditionally the taliban were supported by pakistan and saudi arabia while iran russia turkey india uzbekistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan formed an antitaliban alliance and supported the northern alliance352 after the fall of the taliban rgime at the end of 2001 the composition of the taliban supporters changed according to a study by scholar antonio giustozzi in the years 2005 to 2015 most of the financial support came from the states pakistan saudi arabia iran china and qatar as well as from private donors from saudi arabia from alqaeda and for a short period of time from the islamic state353 about 54 percent of the funding came from foreign governments 10 percent from private donors from abroad and 16 percent from alqaeda and the islamic state in 2014 the amount of external support was close to 900 million354 following the talibans ascension to power the islamic emirate of afghanistans model of governance has been widely criticized by the international community despite the governments repeated calls for international recognition and engagement acting prime minister mohammad hassan akhund stated that his interim administration has met all conditions required for official recognition355 in a bid to gain recognition the taliban sent a letter in september 2021 to the un to accept suhail shaheen as permanent representative of the islamic emirate of afghanistan a request that had already been rejected by the un credentials committee in 2021356 with regards to international relations after the taliban seizure of afghanistan in 2021 taliban spokesperson suhail shaheen told the russian news agency sputnik of course we wont have any relations with israel we want to have relations with other countries israel is not among these countries we would like to have relations with all the regional countries and neighbouring countries as well as asian countries357 on 10 october 2021 russia hosted the taliban for talks in moscow in an effort to boost its influence across central asia officials from 10 different countries russia china pakistan india iran and five formerly soviet central asian states attended the talks which were held during the talibans first official trip to europe since their return to power in midaugust 2021358 the taliban won backing from the 10 regional powers for the idea of a united nations donor conference to help the country stave off economic collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe calling for the un to convene such a conference as soon as possible to help rebuild the country russian officials also called for action against islamic state is fighters who russia said have started to increase their presence in afghanistan since the talibans takeover the taliban delegation which was led by deputy prime minister abdul salam hanafi said that isolating afghanistan is in no ones interests arguing that the extremist group did not pose any security threat to any other country the taliban asked the international community to recognize its government359
