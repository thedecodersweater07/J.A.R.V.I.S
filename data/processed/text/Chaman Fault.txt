the chaman fault is a major active geological fault in pakistan and afghanistan that runs for over 850 km1 tectonically it is actually a system of related geologic faults that separates the eurasian plate from the indoaustralian plate it is a terrestrial primarily transform leftlateral strikeslip fault the slippage rate along the chaman fault system as the indoaustralian plate moves northward relative to the eurasian plate has been estimated at 10 mmyr or more1 in addition to its primary transform aspect the chaman fault system has a compressional component as the indian plate is colliding with the eurasian plate this type of plate boundary is sometimes called a transpressional boundary2 from the south the chaman fault starts at the triple junction where the arabian plate the eurasian plate and the indoaustralian plate meet which is just off the makran coast of pakistan the fault tracks northeast across balochistan and then northnortheast into afghanistan runs just to the west of kabul and then northeastward across the rightlateralslip herat fault up to where it merges with the pamir fault system north of the 38 parallel3 the ghazaband and ornachnal faults are often included as part of the chaman fault system south of the triple junction where the fault zone lies undersea and extends southwest to approximately 10n 57e it is known as the owen fracture zone while there is general agreement that the fault is slipping at a rate of at least 10 mmyr there is a report of volcanic rocks in pakistan dated to 2 my bp which have been offset such as to indicate a slip rate of 2535 mmyr4 offsets have been described throughout the fault in pakistan that are young enough that only the alluvium of the bottom of active dry washes is not displaced5 the parallel mountain ranges of eastern balochistan east to west the kirthar mountains the khude mountains the zarro mountains the pab mountains and the mor mountains are a result of the compressional plate boundary and are aligned parallel to the chaman fault movement the fault itself is west of these ranges
