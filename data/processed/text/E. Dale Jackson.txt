everett dale jackson november 29 1925 july 28 1978 was an american geologist a graduate of the university of california los angeles where he earned his doctorate in 1960 he was involved with the geological training of astronauts the planning and preparation of lunar exploration missions and the dissemination of their discoveries as cochief scientist of the deep sea drilling project dsdp leg 55 that drilled the hawaiianemperor seamount chain in 1977 he found the hawaiian hotspot theory of its formation to be valid everett dale jackson was born in fresno california on november 29 1925 he joined the united states marine corps in 1943 and served in the pacific theater of world war ii for three years1 in 1947 jackson entered the university of california los angeles initially uncertain as to what he would major in he found geology discovered that he enjoyed it and graduated magna cum laude in 1950 after graduation he married josephine arburua they had a son and twin daughters all of whom later pursued careers in science2 jackson joined the united states geological survey usgs and was assigned to the mapping of the stillwater igneous complex in montana he was tasked with determining whether stratigraphy in the layered rocks of the complex could be used to guide exploration for chromite1 this work formed the basis of his phd thesis in 1960 on primary textures and mineral associations in the ultramafic zone of the stillwater complex montana which was published by the usgs as professional paper 35823 in this work he developed concepts such as the stratigraphic cycles that are used in igneous petrology his observations led to new discoveries in the geology of greece1 in 1962 jackson was assigned to administrative duties in washington dc work he did not enjoy so much2 in july of following year5 at the request of eugene shoemaker he was assigned to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa manned spacecraft center in houston texas1 where his task was to provide capable leadership in planning a comprehensive program to establish at houston a fully equipped facility for the distribution control and analysis of lunar and other space samples obtained by flights of manned and unmanned spacecraft6 an agreement was reached between jackson and wally schirra who was in charge of astronaut training for coursework to commence when the nasa astronaut group 3 arrived in february 1964 this provided jackson with several months in which to develop a comprehensive training syllabus for the project apollo astronauts7 he was warned that they were ambivalent if not hostile to training in geology as they were preoccupied with other matters but jackson managed to win them over communicating with them about geology in a way that they found both interesting and engaging he was less successful in his relations with the nasa training staff and left after only one year12 the study of the geology of the moon proved too interesting to resist though and he later became a member of the teams that examined the samples brought back by apollo 11 12 and 14 he then became a member of the scientific advisory team for apollo 15 16 and 17 as such he had an important role in planning and conducting the astronauts geological training in selecting the landing sites for the missions in planning their scientific activities and disseminating their discoveries to the scientific community and the general public during the missions he provided advice to the astronauts from the mission control center in houston that allowed them to return with better samples afterwards he directed teams of scientists in producing coherent reports on the missions for his contributions he was awarded the nasa exceptional scientific achievement medal in 197312 after leaving nasa in 1964 jackson went to hawaii where he studied the oceanic crust and mantle under the island chain in an effort to explain the effects of basaltic magma that he saw around him jackson resorted to experiment with jello1 he led the effort to verify the theory proposed by john tuzo wilson and w jason morgan that the volcanoes of the hawaiianemperor seamount chain were formed by the movement of the pacific plate over the hawaii hotspot to test their theory he became the cochief scientist of the deep sea drilling project dsdp leg 33 which drilled the line islands chain in 1973 a proposal to drill the hawaiianemperor chain was rejected in 1971 but jackson did not give up and managed to get the decision reversed in 1975 he became cochief scientist of dsdp leg 55 in august 1977 and the results of the expedition proved the theory to be valid18 jackson was a visiting professor at the university of california santa barbara in 1967 and princeton university in 1976 he edited the journal of petrology from 1969 to 1973 and remained a member of its advisory board until his death he was a fellow of the american geophysical union the mineralogical society of america and the geological society of america1 jackson died from cancer on july 28 19782 his papers are held by the smithsonian institutions national museum of natural history department of mineral sciences9
