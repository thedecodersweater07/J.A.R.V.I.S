systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design integrate and manage complex systems over their life cycles at its core systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge the individual outcome of such efforts an engineered system can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function issues such as requirements engineering reliability logistics coordination of different teams testing and evaluation maintainability and many other disciplines aka ilities necessary for successful system design development implementation and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects systems engineering deals with work processes optimization methods and risk management tools in such projects it overlaps technical and humancentered disciplines such as industrial engineering production systems engineering process systems engineering mechanical engineering manufacturing engineering production engineering control engineering software engineering electrical engineering cybernetics aerospace engineering organizational studies civil engineering and project management systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole the systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process a manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve highquality outputs with minimum cost and time the systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved and identifying the most probable or highestimpact failures that can occur systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems the term systems engineering can be traced back to bell telephone laboratories in the 1940s1 the need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts properties motivated various industries especially those developing systems for the us military to apply the discipline23 when it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly4 the continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques these methods aid in a better comprehension of the design and developmental control of engineering systems as they grow more complex popular tools that are often used in the systems engineering context were developed during these times including universal systems language usl unified modeling language uml quality function deployment qfd and integration definition idef in 1990 a professional society for systems engineering the national council on systems engineering ncose was founded by representatives from a number of us corporations and organizations ncose was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education as a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the us the name of the organization was changed to the international council on systems engineering incose in 19955 schools in several countries offer graduate programs in systems engineering and continuing education options are also available for practicing engineers6 systems engineering signifies only an approach and more recently a discipline in engineering the aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize various approaches simply and in doing so identify new methods and research opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering as an approach systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavor the traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception design development production and operation of physical systems systems engineering as originally conceived falls within this scope systems engineering in this sense of the term refers to the building of engineering concepts the use of the term systems engineer has evolved over time to embrace a wider more holistic concept of systems and of engineering processes this evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy13 and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and a broader scope traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense that is as applied only to physical systems such as spacecraft and aircraft more recently systems engineering has evolved to take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system peter checkland for example captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that engineering can be read in its general sense you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement14 10 consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering the systems engineering body of knowledge sebok15 has defined three types of systems engineering systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle documenting requirements then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem the system lifecycle this includes fully understanding all of the stakeholders involved oliver et al claim that the systems engineering process can be decomposed into within olivers model the goal of the management process is to organize the technical effort in the lifecycle while the technical process includes assessing available information defining effectiveness measures to create a behavior model create a structure model perform tradeoff analysis and create sequential build test plan16 depending on their application although there are several models that are used in the industry all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback examples of such models include the waterfall model and the vee model also called the v model17 system development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines18 by providing a systems holistic view of the development effort systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and in some cases to termination and disposal in an acquisition the holistic integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost schedule and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item19 this perspective is often replicated in educational programs in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments which helps create an interdisciplinary environment2021 the need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction and therefore the unreliability of the design when speaking in this context complexity incorporates not only engineering systems but also the logical human organization of data at the same time a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data variables or the number of fields that are involved in the design the international space station is an example of such a system the development of smarter control algorithms microprocessor design and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems engineering systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems some examples of these tools can be seen here22 taking an interdisciplinary approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since the behavior of and interaction among system components is not always immediately well defined or understood defining and characterizing such systems and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of systems engineering in doing so the gap that exists between informal requirements from users operators marketing organizations and technical specifications is successfully bridged 23 the principles of systems engineering holism emergent behavior boundary et al can be applied to any system complex or otherwise provided systems thinking is employed at all levels24 besides defense and aerospace many information and technologybased companies software development firms and industries in the field of electronics communications require systems engineers as part of their team25 an analysis by the incose systems engineering center of excellence secoe indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about 1520 of the total project effort26 at the same time studies have shown that systems engineering essentially leads to a reduction in costs among other benefits26 however no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety of industries has been conducted until recently such studies are underway to determine the effectiveness and quantify the benefits of systems engineering2728 systems engineering encourages the use of modeling and simulation to validate assumptions or theories on systems and the interactions within them2930 use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures in safety engineering are integrated into the design process at the same time decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions no method guarantees todays decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived however there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering examples include soft systems methodology jay wright forresters system dynamics method and the unified modeling language umlall currently being explored evaluated and developed to support the engineering decision process education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular engineering courses31 reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines eg aerospace engineering civil engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering manufacturing engineering industrial engineering chemical engineeringplus practical realworld experience to be effective as systems engineers undergraduate university programs explicitly in systems engineering are growing in number but remain uncommon the degrees including such material are most often presented as a bs in industrial engineering typically programs either by themselves or in combination with interdisciplinary study are offered beginning at the graduate level in both academic and professional tracks resulting in the grant of either a msmeng or phdengd degree incose in collaboration with the systems engineering research center at stevens institute of technology maintains a regularly updated directory of worldwide academic programs at suitably accredited institutions6 as of 2017 it lists over 140 universities in north america offering more than 400 undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering widespread institutional acknowledgment of the field as a distinct subdiscipline is quite recent the 2009 edition of the same publication reported the number of such schools and programs at only 80 and 165 respectively education in systems engineering can be taken as systemscentric or domaincentric both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core engineer32 systems engineering tools are strategies procedures and techniques that aid in performing systems engineering on a project or product the purpose of these tools varies from database management graphical browsing simulation and reasoning to document production neutral importexport and more33 there are many definitions of what a system is in the field of systems engineering below are a few authoritative definitions systems engineering processes encompass all creative manual and technical activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design specification for product manufacture and deployment design and development of a system can be divided into four stages each with different definitions41 depending on their application tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process23 models play important and diverse roles in systems engineering a model can be defined in several ways including42 together these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering models used in the verification of a system design as well as schematic models like a functional flow block diagram and mathematical ie quantitative models used in the trade study process this section focuses on the last42 the main reason for using mathematical models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness performance or technical attributes and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities typically a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables the heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs these relationships can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field ideally the relationships express causality not just correlation42 furthermore key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems however diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities under the title of modeling simulationbased systems engineering43page needed initially when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a complex problem graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a systems functional and data requirements44 common graphical representations include a graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system through functions data or interfaces any or each of the above methods is used in an industry based on its requirements for instance the n2 chart may be used where interfaces between systems are important part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system once the requirements are understood it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them and to determine along with other engineers the best technology for a job at this point starting with a trade study systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option a decision matrix or pugh method is one way qfd is another to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important the trade study in turn informs the design which again affects graphic representations of the system without changing the requirements in an se process this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found a decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis reliability analysis system dynamics feedback control and optimization methods systems modeling language sysml a modeling language used for systems engineering applications supports the specification analysis design verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems45 lifecycle modeling language lml is an openstandard modeling language designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle conceptual utilization support and retirement stages46 many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering the following areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering as a distinct entity cognitive systems engineering cse is a specific approach to the description and analysis of humanmachine systems or sociotechnical systems47 the three main themes of cse are how humans cope with complexity how work is accomplished by the use of artifacts and how humanmachine systems and sociotechnical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems cse has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline sometimes also referred to as cognitive engineering the concept of a joint cognitive system jcs has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex sociotechnical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution the more than 20 years of experience with cse has been described extensively4849 like systems engineering configuration management as practiced in the defense and aerospace industry is a broad systemslevel practice the field parallels the taskings of systems engineering where systems engineering deals with requirements development allocation to development items and verification configuration management deals with requirements capture traceability to the development item and audit of development item to ensure that it has achieved the desired functionality and outcomes that systems engineering andor test and verification engineering have obtained and proven through objective testing control engineering and its design and implementation of control systems used extensively in nearly every industry is a large subfield of systems engineering the cruise control on an automobile and the guidance system for a ballistic missile are two examples control systems theory is an active field of applied mathematics involving the investigation of solution spaces and the development of new methods for the analysis of the control process industrial engineering is a branch of engineering that concerns the development improvement implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people money knowledge information equipment energy material and process industrial engineering draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis as well as mathematical physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify predict and evaluate results obtained from such systems production systems engineering pse is an emerging branch of engineering intended to uncover fundamental principles of production systems and utilize them for analysis continuous improvement and design50 interface design and its specification are concerned with assuring that the pieces of a system connect and interoperate with other parts of the system and with external systems as necessary interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces are able to accept new features including mechanical electrical and logical interfaces including reserved wires plugspace command codes and bits in communication protocols this is known as extensibility humancomputer interaction hci or humanmachine interface hmi is another aspect of interface design and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering systems engineering principles are applied in the design of communication protocols for local area networks and wide area networks mechatronic engineering like systems engineering is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that uses dynamic systems modeling to express tangible constructs in that regard it is almost indistinguishable from systems engineering but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller details rather than larger generalizations and relationships as such both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice operations research supports systems engineering operations research briefly is concerned with the optimization of a process under multiple constraints5152 performance engineering is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for performance throughout its life performance is usually defined as the speed with which a certain operation is executed or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of time performance may be degraded when operations queued to execute are throttled by limited system capacity for example the performance of a packetswitched network is characterized by the endtoend packet transit delay or the number of packets switched in an hour the design of highperformance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling whereas the delivery of highperformance implementation involves thorough performance testing performance engineering relies heavily on statistics queueing theory and probability theory for its tools and processes program management or project management has many similarities with systems engineering but has broaderbased origins than the engineering ones of systems engineering project management is also closely related to both program management and systems engineering both include scheduling as engineering support tool in assessing interdisciplinary concerns under management process in particular the direct relationship of resources performance features and risk to the duration of a task or the dependency links among tasks and impacts across the system lifecycle are systems engineering concerns proposal engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design construct and operate a costeffective proposal development system basically proposal engineering uses the systems engineering process to create a costeffective proposal and increase the odds of a successful proposal reliability engineering is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life ie it does not fail more frequently than expected next to the prediction of failure it is just as much about the prevention of failure reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system it is closely associated with maintainability availability dependability or rams preferred by some and integrated logistics support reliability engineering is always a critical component of safety engineering as in failure mode and effects analysis fmea and hazard fault tree analysis and of security engineering risk management the practice of assessing and dealing with risk is one of the interdisciplinary parts of systems engineering in development acquisition or operational activities the inclusion of risk in tradeoffs with cost schedule and performance features involves the iterative complex configuration management of traceability and evaluation to the scheduling and requirements management across domains and for the system lifecycle that requires the interdisciplinary technical approach of systems engineering systems engineering has risk management define tailor implement and monitor a structured process for risk management which is integrated into the overall effort53 the techniques of safety engineering may be applied by nonspecialist engineers in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of safetycritical failures the system safety engineering function helps to identify safety hazards in emerging designs and may assist with techniques to mitigate the effects of potentially hazardous conditions that cannot be designed out of systems security engineering can be viewed as an interdisciplinary field that integrates the community of practice for control systems design reliability safety and systems engineering it may involve such subspecialties as authentication of system users system targets and others people objects and processes from its beginnings software engineering has helped shape modern systems engineering practice the techniques used in the handling of the complexities of large softwareintensive systems have had a major effect on the shaping and reshaping of the tools methods and processes
