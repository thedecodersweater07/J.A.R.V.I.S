a liquidpropellant rocket or liquid rocket uses a rocket engine burning liquid propellants alternate approaches use gaseous or solid propellants liquids are desirable propellants because they have reasonably high density and their combustion products have high specific impulse isp this allows the volume of the propellant tanks to be relatively low liquid rockets can be monopropellant rockets using a single type of propellant or bipropellant rockets using two types of propellant tripropellant rockets using three types of propellant are rare liquid oxidizer propellants are also used in hybrid rockets with some of the advantages of a solid rocket bipropellant liquid rockets use a liquid fuel such as liquid hydrogen or rp1 and a liquid oxidizer such as liquid oxygen the engine may be a cryogenic rocket engine where the fuel and oxidizer such as hydrogen and oxygen are gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures most designs of liquid rocket engines are throttleable for variable thrust operation some allow control of the propellant mixture ratio ratio at which oxidizer and fuel are mixed some can be shut down and with a suitable ignition system or selfigniting propellant restarted hybrid rockets apply a liquid or gaseous oxidizer to a solid fuel1 354356 the use of liquid propellants has a number of advantages use of liquid propellants can also be associated with a number of issues liquid rocket engines have tankage and pipes to store and transfer propellant an injector system and one or more combustion chambers with associated nozzles typical liquid propellants have densities roughly similar to water approximately 07 to 14 gcm3 0025 to 0051 lbcu in an exception is liquid hydrogen which has a much lower density while requiring only relatively modest pressure to prevent vaporization the density and low pressure of liquid propellants permit lightweight tankage approximately 1 of the contents for dense propellants and around 10 for liquid hydrogen the increased tank mass is due to liquid hydrogens low density and the mass of the required insulation for injection into the combustion chamber the propellant pressure at the injectors needs to be greater than the chamber pressure this is often achieved with a pump suitable pumps usually use centrifugal turbopumps due to their high power and light weight although reciprocating pumps have been employed in the past turbopumps are usually lightweight and can give excellent performance with an onearth weight well under 1 of the thrust indeed overall thrust to weight ratios including a turbopump have been as high as 1551 with the spacex merlin 1d rocket engine and up to 1801 with the vacuum version5 instead of a pump some designs use a tank of a highpressure inert gas such as helium to pressurize the propellants these rockets often provide lower deltav because the mass of the pressurant tankage reduces performance in some designs for high altitude or vacuum use the tankage mass can be acceptable the major components of a rocket engine are therefore the combustion chamber thrust chamber pyrotechnic igniter propellant feed system valves regulators propellant tanks and the rocket engine nozzle for feeding propellants to the combustion chamber liquidpropellant engines are either pressurefed or pumpfed with pumpfed engines working in a variety of engine cycles liquid propellants are often pumped into the combustion chamber with a lightweight centrifugal turbopump recently some aerospace companies have used electric pumps with batteries in simpler small engines an inert gas stored in a tank at a high pressure is sometimes used instead of pumps to force propellants into the combustion chamber these engines may have a higher mass ratio but are usually more reliable and are therefore used widely in satellites for orbit maintenance1 thousands of combinations of fuels and oxidizers have been tried over the years some of the more common and practical ones are one of the most efficient mixtures oxygen and hydrogen suffers from the extremely low temperatures required for storing liquid hydrogen around 20 k or 2532 c or 4237 f and very low fuel density 70 kgm3 or 44 lbcu ft compared to rp1 at 820 kgm3 or 51 lbcu ft necessitating large tanks that must also be lightweight and insulating lightweight foam insulation on the space shuttle external tank led to the space shuttle columbias destruction as a piece broke loose damaged its wing and caused it to break up on atmospheric reentry liquid methanelng has several advantages over lh2 its performance max specific impulse is lower than that of lh2 but higher than that of rp1 kerosene and solid propellants and its higher density similarly to other hydrocarbon fuels provides higher thrust to volume ratios than lh2 although its density is not as high as that of rp17 this makes it specially attractive for reusable launch systems because higher density allows for smaller motors propellant tanks and associated systems6 lng also burns with less or no soot less or no coking than rp1 which eases reusability when compared with it and lng and rp1 burn cooler than lh2 so lng and rp1 do not deform the interior structures of the engine as much this means that engines that burn lng can be reused more than those that burn rp1 or lh2 unlike engines that burn lh2 both rp1 and lng engines can be designed with a shared shaft with a single turbine and two turbopumps one each for lox and lngrp17 in space lng does not need heaters to keep it liquid unlike rp18 lng is less expensive being readily available in large quantities it can be stored for more prolonged periods of time and is less explosive than lh26 many noncryogenic bipropellants are hypergolic self igniting for storable icbms and most spacecraft including crewed vehicles planetary probes and satellites storing cryogenic propellants over extended periods is unfeasible because of this mixtures of hydrazine or its derivatives in combination with nitrogen oxides are generally used for such applications but are toxic and carcinogenic consequently to improve handling some crew vehicles such as dream chaser and space ship two plan to use hybrid rockets with nontoxic fuel and oxidizer combinations the injector implementation in liquid rockets determines the percentage of the theoretical performance of the nozzle that can be achieved a poor injector performance causes unburnt propellant to leave the engine giving poor efficiency additionally injectors are also usually key in reducing thermal loads on the nozzle by increasing the proportion of fuel around the edge of the chamber this gives much lower temperatures on the walls of the nozzle injectors can be as simple as a number of small diameter holes arranged in carefully constructed patterns through which the fuel and oxidizer travel the speed of the flow is determined by the square root of the pressure drop across the injectors the shape of the hole and other details such as the density of the propellant the first injectors used on the v2 created parallel jets of fuel and oxidizer which then combusted in the chamber this gave quite poor efficiency injectors today classically consist of a number of small holes which aim jets of fuel and oxidizer so that they collide at a point in space a short distance away from the injector plate this helps to break the flow up into small droplets that burn more easily the main types of injectors are the pintle injector permits good mixture control of fuel and oxidizer over a wide range of flow rates the pintle injector was used in the apollo lunar module engines descent propulsion system and the kestrel engine it is currently used in the merlin engine on falcon 9 and falcon heavy rockets the rs25 engine designed for the space shuttle uses a system of fluted posts which use heated hydrogen from the preburner to vaporize the liquid oxygen flowing through the center of the posts10 and this improves the rate and stability of the combustion process previous engines such as the f1 used for the apollo program had significant issues with oscillations that led to destruction of the engines but this was not a problem in the rs25 due to this design detail valentin glushko invented the centripetal injector in the early 1930s and it has been almost universally used in russian engines rotational motion is applied to the liquid and sometimes the two propellants are mixed then it is expelled through a small hole where it forms a coneshaped sheet that rapidly atomizes goddards first liquid engine used a single impinging injector german scientists in wwii experimented with impinging injectors on flat plates used successfully in the wasserfall missile to avoid instabilities such as chugging which is a relatively low speed oscillation the engine must be designed with enough pressure drop across the injectors to render the flow largely independent of the chamber pressure this pressure drop is normally achieved by using at least 20 of the chamber pressure across the injectors nevertheless particularly in larger engines a high speed combustion oscillation is easily triggered and these are not well understood these high speed oscillations tend to disrupt the gas side boundary layer of the engine and this can cause the cooling system to rapidly fail destroying the engine these kinds of oscillations are much more common on large engines and plagued the development of the saturn v but were finally overcome some combustion chambers such as those of the rs25 engine use helmholtz resonators as damping mechanisms to stop particular resonant frequencies from growing to prevent these issues the rs25 injector design instead went to a lot of effort to vaporize the propellant prior to injection into the combustion chamber although many other features were used to ensure that instabilities could not occur later research showed that these other features were unnecessary and the gas phase combustion worked reliably testing for stability often involves the use of small explosives these are detonated within the chamber during operation and causes an impulsive excitation by examining the pressure trace of the chamber to determine how quickly the effects of the disturbance die away it is possible to estimate the stability and redesign features of the chamber if required for liquidpropellant rockets four different ways of powering the injection of the propellant into the chamber are in common use11 fuel and oxidizer must be pumped into the combustion chamber against the pressure of the hot gasses being burned and engine power is limited by the rate at which propellant can be pumped into the combustion chamber for atmospheric or launcher use high pressure and thus high power engine cycles are desirable to minimize gravity drag for orbital use lower power cycles are usually fine selecting an engine cycle is one of the earlier steps to rocket engine design a number of tradeoffs arise from this selection some of which include injectors are commonly laid out so that a fuelrich layer is created at the combustion chamber wall this reduces the temperature there and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher isp and better system performance12 a liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle ignition can be performed in many ways but perhaps more so with liquid propellants than other rockets a consistent and significant ignitions source is required a delay of ignition in some cases as small as a few tens of milliseconds can cause overpressure of the chamber due to excess propellant a hard start can even cause an engine to explode generally ignition systems try to apply flames across the injector surface with a mass flow of approximately 1 of the full mass flow of the chamber safety interlocks are sometimes used to ensure the presence of an ignition source before the main valves open however reliability of the interlocks can in some cases be lower than the ignition system thus it depends on whether the system must fail safe or whether overall mission success is more important interlocks are rarely used for upper uncrewed stages where failure of the interlock would cause loss of mission but are present on the rs25 engine to shut the engines down prior to liftoff of the space shuttle in addition detection of successful ignition of the igniter is surprisingly difficult some systems use thin wires that are cut by the flames pressure sensors have also seen some use methods of ignition include pyrotechnic electrical spark or hot wire and chemical hypergolic propellants have the advantage of self igniting reliably and with less chance of hard starts in the 1940s the russians began to start engines with hypergols to then switch over to the primary propellants after ignition this was also used on the american f1 rocket engine on the apollo program ignition with a pyrophoric agent triethylaluminium ignites on contact with air and will ignite andor decompose on contact with water and with any other oxidizerit is one of the few substances sufficiently pyrophoric to ignite on contact with cryogenic liquid oxygen the enthalpy of combustion ch is 510570 290 kjmol 122029 069 kcalmol its easy ignition makes it particularly desirable as a rocket engine ignitor may be used in conjunction with triethylborane to create triethylaluminumtriethylborane better known as teateb the idea of a liquidfueled rocket as understood in the modern context first appeared in 1903 in the book exploration of the universe with rocketpropelled vehicles13 by the russian rocket scientist konstantin tsiolkovsky the magnitude of his contribution to astronautics is astounding including the tsiolkovsky rocket equation multistaged rockets and using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen in liquid propellant rockets14 tsiolkovsky influenced later rocket scientists throughout europe like wernher von braun soviet search teams at peenemnde found a german translation of a book by tsiolkovsky of which almost every pagewas embellished by von brauns comments and notes15 leading soviet rocketengine designer valentin glushko and rocket designer sergey korolev studied tsiolkovskys works as youths16 and both sought to turn tsiolkovskys theories into reality17 from 1929 to 1930 in leningrad glushko pursued rocket research at the gas dynamics laboratory gdl where a new research section was set up for the study of liquidpropellant and electric rocket engines this resulted in the creation of orm from experimental rocket motor in russian engines orm1 ru to orm52 ru18 a total of 100 bench tests of liquidpropellant rockets were conducted using various types of fuel both low and highboiling and thrust up to 300 kg was achieved1918 during this period in moscow fredrich tsander a scientist and inventor was designing and building liquid rocket engines which ran on compressed air and gasoline tsander investigated highenergy fuels including powdered metals mixed with gasoline in september 1931 tsander formed the moscow based group for the study of reactive motion20 better known by its russian acronym gird21 in may 1932 sergey korolev replaced tsander as the head of gird on 17 august 1933 mikhail tikhonravov launched the first soviet liquidpropelled rocket the gird9 fueled by liquid oxygen and jellied gasoline it reached an altitude of 400 metres 1300 ft22 in january 1933 tsander began development of the girdx rocket this design burned liquid oxygen and gasoline and was one of the first engines to be regeneratively cooled by the liquid oxygen which flowed around the inner wall of the combustion chamber before entering it problems with burnthrough during testing prompted a switch from gasoline to less energetic alcohol the final missile 22 metres 72 ft long by 140 millimetres 55 in in diameter had a mass of 30 kilograms 66 lb and it was anticipated that it could carry a 2 kilograms 44 lb payload to an altitude of 55 kilometres 34 mi23 the gird x rocket was launched on 25 november 1933 and flew to a height of 80 meters24 in 1933 gdl and gird merged and became the reactive scientific research institute rnii at rnii gushko continued the development of liquid propellant rocket engines 53 to 102 with orm65 ru powering the rp318 rocketpowered aircraft18 in 1938 leonid dushkin replaced glushko and continued development of the orm engines including the engine for the rocket powered interceptor the bereznyakisayev bi125 at rnii tikhonravov worked on developing oxygenalcohol liquidpropellant rocket engines26 ultimately liquid propellant rocket engines were given a low priority during the late 1930s at rnii however the research was productive and very important for later achievements of the soviet rocket program27 peruvian pedro paulet who had experimented with rockets throughout his life in peru wrote a letter to el comercio in lima in 1927 claiming he had experimented with a liquid rocket engine while he was a student in paris three decades earlier2829 historians of early rocketry experiments among them max valier willy ley and john d clark have given differing amounts of credence to paulets report valier applauded paulets liquidpropelled rocket design in the verein fr raumschiffahrt publication die rakete saying the engine had amazing power and that his plans were necessary for future rocket development30 hermann oberth would name paulet as a pioneer in rocketry in 196531 wernher von braun would also describe paulet as the pioneer of the liquid fuel propulsion motor and stated that paulet helped man reach the moon2832333435 paulet was later approached by nazi germany being invited to join the astronomische gesellschaft to help develop rocket technology though he refused to assist after discovering that the project was destined for weaponization and never shared the formula for his propellant3637 according to filmmaker and researcher lvaro meja frederick i ordway iii would later attempt to discredit paulets discoveries in the context of the cold war and in an effort to shift the public image of von braun away from his history with nazi germany38 the first flight of a liquidpropellant rocket took place on march 16 1926 at auburn massachusetts when american professor dr robert h goddard launched a vehicle using liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants39 the rocket which was dubbed nell rose just 41 feet during a 25second flight that ended in a cabbage field but it was an important demonstration that rockets using liquid propulsion were possible goddard proposed liquid propellants about fifteen years earlier and began to seriously experiment with them in 1921 the germanromanian hermann oberth published a book in 1923 suggesting the use of liquid propellants40 in germany engineers and scientists became enthralled with liquid propulsion building and testing them in the late 1920s within opel rak the worlds first rocket program in rsselsheim according to max valiers account41 opel rak rocket designer friedrich wilhelm sander launched two liquidfuel rockets at opel rennbahn in rsselsheim on april 10 and april 12 1929 these opel rak rockets have been the first european and after goddard the worlds second liquidfuel rockets in history in his book raketenfahrt valier describes the size of the rockets as of 21 cm in diameter and with a length of 74 cm weighing 7 kg empty and 16 kg with fuel the maximum thrust was 45 to 50 kp with a total burning time of 132 seconds these properties indicate a gas pressure pumping the main purpose of these tests was to develop the liquid rocketpropulsion system for a gebrdermllergriessheim aircraft42 under construction for a planned flight across the english channel also spaceflight historian frank h winter curator at national air and space museum in washington dc confirms the opel group was working in addition to their solidfuel rockets used for landspeed records and the worlds first crewed rocketplane flights with the opel rak1 on liquidfuel rockets43 by may 1929 the engine produced a thrust of 200 kg 440 lb for longer than fifteen minutes and in july 1929 the opel rak collaborators were able to attain powered phases of more than thirty minutes for thrusts of 300 kg 660lb at opels works in rsselsheim again according to max valiers account the great depression brought an end to the opel rak activities after working for the german military in the early 1930s sander was arrested by gestapo in 1935 when private rocketengineering became forbidden in germany he was convicted of treason to 5 years in prison and forced to sell his company he died in 193844 max valiers via arthur rudolph and heylandt who died while experimenting in 1930 and friedrich sanders work on liquidfuel rockets was confiscated by the german military the heereswaffenamt and integrated into the activities under general walter dornberger in the early and mid1930s in a field near berlin45 max valier was a cofounder of an amateur research group the vfr working on liquid rockets in the early 1930s and many of whose members eventually became important rocket technology pioneers including wernher von braun von braun served as head of the army research station that designed the v2 rocket weapon for the nazis by the late 1930s use of rocket propulsion for crewed flight began to be seriously experimented with as germanys heinkel he 176 made the first crewed rocketpowered flight using a liquid rocket engine designed by german aeronautics engineer hellmuth walter on june 20 193946 the only production rocketpowered combat aircraft ever to see military service the me 163 komet in 194445 also used a walterdesigned liquid rocket engine the walter hwk 109509 which produced up to 1700 kgf 167 kn thrust at full power after world war ii the american government and military finally seriously considered liquidpropellant rockets as weapons and began to fund work on them the soviet union did likewise and thus began the space race in 2010s 3d printed engines started being used for spaceflight examples of such engines include superdraco used in launch escape system of the spacex dragon 2 and also engines used for first or second stages in launch vehicles from astra47 orbex4849
