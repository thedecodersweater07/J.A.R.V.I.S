robert albert charles esnaultpelterie french pronunciation b alb al eno plti 8 november 1881 6 december 1957 was a french aircraft designer and spaceflight theorist he is referred to as being one of the founders of modern rocketry and astronautics along with the russian konstantin tsiolkovsky the germans hermann oberth wernher von braun and the american robert h goddard234 he was born on 8 november 1881 in paris to a textile industrialist he was educated at the facult des sciences studying engineering at the sorbonne he served in world war i and was made an officier de la lgion dhonneur in november 1928 on board the ile de france while sailing to new york city he was married to carmen bernaldo de quirs the daughter of don antonio and yvonne cabarrus and granddaughter of general marquis of santiago grandee of spain head of the military household of queen isabella ii he died on 6 december 1957 in nice france esnaultpelterie developed and manufactured aeroplanes and aero engines under the name rep his first experiments in aviation were based on the wright brothers 1902 glider his first glider design was tested on a beach near calais but was not successful his glider was based upon an incomplete understanding of the wright glider and although using a version of the wingwarping which the wright brothers had used to control their aircraft this did not work properly and was abandoned since he considered it dangerous5 after condemning the wright brothers approach he developed the concept of the aileron fitting a pair of midgap control surfaces in front of the wings this potentially initial example of the use of ailerons of any sort is believed to predate all others6 after their patent description in 1868 by british inventor m p w boulton was approved in that year in 1906 he began his first experiments in towed flight on 19 september 1906 he flew 500 m 1600 ft he made his first powered flight on 10 october 1907 a distance of 100 m 330 ft with the rep 1 this was driven by a sevencylinder 30 hp aircooled engine of his own design trials of the monoplane rep 2 began on 8 june 1908 this aircraft set a record with a 1200 m 3900 ft flight reaching an altitude of 30 m 98 ft after a modified version of this plane was flown for the last time in 1909 at rheims pelterie stopped flying and instead focused on the development and manufacture of aircraft the vickers rep type monoplane was based upon his designs and marked the beginning of aircraft production at the later vickers limited in 1912 he introduced the rep type n and in 1914 the rep parasol monoplane his family had invested heavily to fund his aircraft designs and this had left them nearly financially ruined however he was the inventor of the joystick flight control and owned a patent on the design this would end up being integrated during 1908 into fellow french aviator louis blriots eighth design setting the pattern for future user interfaces in aircraft flight control system design7 following the war esnaultpelterie was involved in litigation over his joystick patent8 many aircraft built during the war had used this design and the aircraft companies owed him royalties the damages he won and subsequent royalties made him a wealthy man this also allowed him to repay his fathers significant investment esnaultpelterie designed and built his own aero engines he also sold them under the name rep they were all of an unusual multiplebanked fan or halfradial type the first design featured seven cylinders doublebanked with four in one bank and three in the other and was rated at 30 horsepower 22 kw a later model doubled them up to create a 14 cylinder quadruplebanked engine giving 60 horsepower 45 kw910 he became interested in space travel and not knowing of tsiolkovskys 1903 work in 1913 produced a paper that presented the rocket equation and calculated the energies required to reach the moon and nearby planets11 in this talk he proposed the use of atomic energy using 400 kg of radium to power an interplanetary vehicle his culminating work was lastronautique published in 1930 a later version published in 1934 included details on interplanetary travel and applications of nuclear power on 8 june 1927 esnaultpelterie gave a symposium for the socit astronomique de france french astronomical society titled lexploration par fuses de la trs haute atmosphre et la possibilit des voyages interplantaires concerning the exploration of outer space using rocket propulsion jeanjacques barr attended this lecture and developed a correspondence with esnaultpelterie on the topic of rockets in 1929 esnaultpelterie proposed the idea of the ballistic missile for military bombardment by 1930 esnaultpelterie and barr had persuaded the french war department to fund a study of the concept in 1931 the two began experimenting with various types of rocket propulsion systems including liquid propellants the same year he ran a demonstration of a rocket engine powered with gasoline and liquid oxygen during an experiment with a rocket design using tetranitromethane he lost four fingers from his right hand during an explosion ultimately their work failed to create an interest in rocketry within france the prix rephirsch was an international award of the socit astronomique de france given in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics12 established by esnaultpelterie and andrlouis hirsch13 a parisian banker and science enthusiast it was the first prize for astronautics in the world14 the award was given to recognize the best original scientific work theoretical or experimental that is able to advance one of the questions related to the realisation of space travel or to increase human understanding of one of the branches related to the science of astronautics15 the idea for establishing the prize originated during a dinner hirsch and esnaultpelterie organised in paris on 26 december 1927 the guests discussed the emerging science of space travel which they called astronautics at the suggestion of science fiction writer jh rosny the elder16 hirsch and esnaultpelterie provided funds 5000 francs annually for 1928 1929 and 1930 to the socit astronomique de france for an annual award in astronautics in their names17 a comit dastronautique was established to manage the prize in addition to esnaultpelterie hirsch and rosny the elder it included general gustaveauguste ferri president jean perrin and eugne fichot vicepresidents and other expert members181920 the prize was awarded for 10 years in 1936 the name of the award changed from the prix rephirsch to the prix international dastronautique international astronautics prize21 the laureates were though the award was shortlived it helped stimulate interest in the new science of astronautics and encouraged early pioneers in the field31 among his interests were horseback riding playing golf camping and driving cars during his lifetime he filed about 120 patents in a variety of fields ranging from metallurgy to automobile suspension he was the inventor of the center stick aircraft control and of a new type of fuel pump he also developed the idea of rocket maneuver by means of vectored thrust
