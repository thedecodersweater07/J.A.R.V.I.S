sergei pavlovich korolevab 12 january 1907 os 30 december 1906 14 january 1966 was the lead soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft designer during the space race between the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s and 1960s he invented the r7 rocket sputnik 1 and was involved in the launching of laika sputnik 3 the first humanmade object to make contact with another celestial body belka and strelka the first human being yuri gagarin into space voskhod 1 and the first person alexei leonov to conduct a spacewalk3 although korolev trained as an aircraft designer his greatest strengths proved to be in design integration organization and strategic planning arrested on a false official charge as a member of an antisoviet counterrevolutionary organization which would later be reduced to saboteur of military technology he was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six years including a few months in a kolyma labour camp following his release he became a recognized rocket designer and the key figure in the development of the soviet intercontinental ballistic missile program he later directed the soviet space program and was made a member of soviet academy of sciences overseeing the early successes of the sputnik and vostok projects including the first human earth orbit mission by yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 korolevs unexpected death in 1966 interrupted implementation of his plans for a soviet crewed moon landing before the united states 1969 mission before his death he was officially identified only as glavny konstruktor or the chief designer to protect him from possible cold war assassination attempts by the united states4 even some of the cosmonauts who worked with him were unaware of his last name he only went by chief designer3 only following his death in 1966 was his identity revealed and he received the appropriate public recognition as the driving force behind soviet accomplishments in space exploration during and following the international geophysical year5 korolev was born in the city of zhytomyr the capital of volhynian governorate of the russian empire now in ukraine his father pavel yakovlevich korolev was born in mogilev to a russian soldier and a belarusian mother6789 his mother maria nikolaevna koroleva moskalenkobulanina was a daughter of a wealthy merchant from the city of nizhyn with ukrainian greek and polish heritage810 his father moved to zhytomyr to be a teacher of the russian language11 three years after sergeis birth the couple separated due to financial difficulties although pavel later wrote to maria requesting a meeting with his son sergei was told by his mother that his father had allegedly died sergei never saw his father after the family breakup and pavel died in 1929 before his son learned the truth12 korolev grew up in nizhyn5 under the care of his maternal grandparents nikolay yakovlevich moskalenko who was a trader of the second guild and maria matveevna moskalenko ne fursa a daughter of a local cossack korolevs mother also had a sister anna and two brothers yuri and vasily maria koroleva was frequently away attending womens higher education courses in kiev so sergei was often by himself and grew up a lonely child with few friends in 1914 world war i commenced with social unrest in the kiev area no one had time for the seven year old korolev during this period and he was noted as being stubborn persistent and argumentative13 korolev began reading at an early age from his grandfathers newspapers and his preschool teacher noted he had an excellent memory with abilities in mathematics reading and writing14 his mother divorced pavel in 1915 and in 1916 married grigory mikhailovich balanin an electrical engineer who had been educated in germany but who had to attend the kiev polytechnic university because german engineering diplomas were not recognized in russia grigory was an excellent stepfather positively influencing korolevs manners and study habits13 after getting a job with the regional railway grigory moved the family to odessa5 in 1917 where they endured hardships with many other families through the tumultuous years following the russian revolution and continuing internecine struggles until the bolsheviks assumed unchallenged power in 1920 local schools were closed and young korolev had to continue his studies at home where he suffered from a bout of typhus during the severe food shortages of 19195 korolev received vocational training in carpentry and academics at the odessa building trades school stroyprofshkola no 1 enjoyment of a 1913 air show inspired interest in aeronautical engineering he made an independent study of flight theory and worked at the local glider club a detachment of military seaplanes had been stationed in odessa and korolev took a keen interest in their operations15 in 1923 he joined the society of aviation and aerial navigation of ukraine and the crimea oavuk he had his first flying lesson after joining the odessa hydroplane squadron and had many opportunities to fly as a passenger in 1924 he designed an oavuk construction project glider called the k5 when he was 17 years old16 he briefly trained in gymnastics until his academic work suffered korolev hoped to attend the zhukovsky academy in moscow but he did not meet the academys standards he attended the kiev polytechnic institutes aviation branch in 1924 while living with his uncle yuri and earned money for his courses by doing odd jobs his curriculum included engineering physics and mathematics classes he met and became attracted to a classmate xenia vincentini who would later become his first wife in 1925 he was accepted into a limited class on glider construction and suffered two broken ribs flying the training glider they built he continued courses at kiev until he was accepted into the bauman moscow state technical university mvtu bmstu in july 1926 having the famous aircraft designer andrei tupolev as his mentor who was a professor there517 korolev studied specialized aviation topics until 1929 while living with his family in the typically crowded conditions of moscow korolev enjoyed opportunities to fly gliders and powered aircraft during this part of his education he designed a glider in 1928 and flew it in a competition the next year the communist party accelerated the education of engineers in 1929 to meet the countrys urgent need for their skills korolev obtained a diploma by producing a practical aircraft design by the end of the year18 after graduation korolev worked with some of the best soviet designers at the 4th experimental section aircraft design bureau opo4 headed by paul aim richard fr who emigrated to the ussr from france in the 1920s19 he did not stand out in this group but while so employed he also worked independently to design a glider capable of performing aerobatics in 1930 he became interested in the possibilities of liquidfueled rocket engines to propel airplanes while working at the central aerohydrodynamic institute tsagi as a lead engineer on the tupolev tb3 heavy bomber20 korolev earned his pilots license in 1930 and explored the operational limits of the aircraft he piloted wondering what was beyond his planes altitude limit and how he could get there many believe this was the start of his interest in space21 korolev married xenia vincentini on 6 august 1931 he had first proposed marriage to her in 1924 but she then declined so she might continue her higher education in 1931 korolev and space travel enthusiast friedrich zander participated in the creation of the group for the study of reactive motion gird one of the earliest statesponsored centers for rocket development in the ussr while there he met mikhail tikhonravov a glider pilot and aerospace engineer who would later work under korolevs sputnik group22 in may 1932 korolev was appointed chief of the group and military interest encouraged funding of group projects on august 18 1933 gird launched the first hybrid propellant rocket the gird0923 and on november 25 1933 the soviets first liquidfueled rocket girdx24 growing military interest in this new technology caused gird to be merged with the gas dynamics laboratory gdl at leningrad in 1933 to create the reactive scientific research institute rnii which brought together the best of the soviet rocket talent including korolev georgy langemak and former gdl engine designer valentin glushko2526 korolev was appointed deputy head under ivan kleymyonov however in 1934 following a disagreement over the direction of rnii korolev was demoted to section chief of winged missiles and was replaced by georgy langemak25note 1 korolev supervised development of cruise missiles and a crewed rocketpowered glider rocket flight in stratosphere was published by korolev in 193427 on 10 april 1935 korolevs wife gave birth to their daughter natalya and they moved out of sergeis parents home and into their own apartment in 1936 both korolev and his wife had careers and sergei always spent long hours at his design office joseph stalins great purge severely damaged rnii with director kleymyonov and chief engineer langemak arrested in november 1937 tortured made to sign false confessions and executed in january 1938 glushko was arrested in march 1938 and with many other leading engineers was imprisoned in the gulag korolev was arrested by the nkvd on 27 june 1938 after being accused of a variety of charges including false charges extracted from kleymyonov langemak and glushko he was tortured in the lubyanka prison to extract a confession glushko and korolev had reportedly been denounced by andrei kostikov who became the head of rnii after its leadership was arrested2826 korolev was sent to prison where he wrote many appeals to the authorities including stalin himself following the fall of nkvd head nikolai yezhov the new chief lavrenti beria chose to retry korolev on reduced charges in 1939 but by that time korolev was on his way from prison to a gulag forced labour camp in kolyma in the far east of siberia where he spent several months in a gold mine before word reached him of his retrial work camp conditions of inadequate food shelter and clothing killed thousands of prisoners each month21 korolev sustained injuries including possibly a heart attack29 and lost most of his teeth from scurvy before being returned to moscow in late 1939 when he reached moscow korolevs sentence was reduced to eight years30 however due to the intervention by his old mentor andrei tupolev he was relocated to a prison for scientists and engineers in september 194031 these were labor camps where scientists and engineers worked on projects assigned by the communist party leadership the central design bureau 29 ckb29 29 of the nkvd served as tupolevs engineering facility and korolev was brought here to work during world war ii this sharashka designed both the tupolev tu2 bomber and the petlyakov pe2 dive bomber the group was moved several times during the war the first time to avoid capture by advancing german forces korolev was moved in 1942 to the sharashka of kazan okb16 under glushko korolev and glushko designed the rd1 khz32 auxiliary rocket motor tested in an unsuccessful fastclimb lavochkin la7r korolev was isolated from his family until 27 june 1944 when healong with tupolev glushko and otherswas finally discharged by special government decree although the charges against him were not dropped until 195733 korolev rarely talked about his experience in the gulag and lived under constant fear of being executed for the military secrets he possessed he was deeply affected by his time in the camp becoming reserved and cautious as a result he later learned that glushko was one of his accusers and this was likely the cause of the lifelong animosity between the two men the design bureau was handed over from nkvd control to the governments aviation industry commission korolev continued working with the bureau for another year serving as deputy designer under glushko and studying various rocket designs34 korolev was commissioned into the red army with the rank of colonel in 1945 his first military decoration was the badge of honor awarded in 1945 for his work on the development of rocket motors for military aircraft on 8 september 1945 korolev was brought to germany along with many other experts to recover the technology of the german v2 rocket21 the soviets worked with german specialists to understand and replicate the rocket technology placing a priority on recreating the entire german v2 rocket in february 1946 the institute nordhausen was formed with korolev as chief engineer glushko as head of engine assembly and propulsion systems and german helmut grttrup who previously worked with wernher von braun as general director35 the work continued in east germany until late 1946 when 2000 german scientists and engineers were sent to the ussr through operation osoaviakhim most of the german experts grttrup being an exception had not worked directly with wernher von braun many of the leading german rocket scientists including dr von braun himself surrendered to americans and were transported to the united states as part of operation paperclip36 stalin made rocket and missile development a national priority upon signing a decree on 13 may 194621 and a new institute called scientific research institute no 88 nii88 was created for that purpose in the suburbs of moscow development of ballistic missiles was placed under the military control of dmitriy ustinov through the decree signed by stalin and ustinov appointed korolev as chief designer of longrange missiles at department no 3 of nii8837 during this period korolev demonstrated his organisation and management capabilities by organising a council of chief designers which assisted in circumnavigating the bureaucratic hierarchy of the soviet missile industry this group eventually assumed engineering control over the early soviet space program38 korolev returned from germany in february 1947 and took up his duties as chief designer and head of department no 3 of nii88 initially tasked with reproduction of the v2 the soviets were only able to obtain parts to assemble approximately a dozen v2 rockets so the decision was made to replicate a soviet version which was designated the r1 initially korolev opposed this decision as he thought it was a waste of time and they should move immediately to manufacture a more advanced version which had been designated the r2 however korolev was overruled and was ordered to assemble what v2s they had for flight testing then create the r1 using soviet infrastructure and materials nii88 also incorporated 170 german specialists including helmut grttrup and fritz karl preikschat with approximately half based at branch 1 of nii88 on gorodomlya island in lake seliger some 200 kilometres 120 mi from moscow the germans provided a variety of support to the soviet efforts particularly on assembling the v2 and creating the r139 the first soviet tests of v2 rockets took place in october 1947 at kapustin yar with korolev as management lead for the project numerous german engineers also participated in the tests a total of 11 v2 rockets were launched with 5 reaching their designated targets4041 in september 1948 testing of the r1 began at kapustin yar where korolev was a formal member of the state commission for testing the r1 no germans participated in these tests which launched 9 rockets between september and november 194842 korolev continued to lobby for the design and construction of the r2 including meeting with stalin in april 1947 but faced competition from a proposal from the germans called the g1 whilst the german proposal was initially supported by soviet management korolev opposed utilising german specialists for personal reasons and basically ignored their suggestions and advice due to political and security concerns german specialists were not allowed knowledge or access to any soviet missile design43 and in december 1948 work on the g1 proposal was terminated44 the ministry of defence decided to dissolve the german team in 1950 and repatriated the german engineers and their families between december 1951 and november 195345 in april 1948 the go ahead for scientific and experimental work was approved which led to the creation of the r2 the r2 doubled the range of the v2 and was the first design to utilize a separable warhead this was followed by the r3 which had a range of 3000 kilometres 1900 mi and thus could target england46 glushko couldnt obtain the required thrust from the r3 engines so the project was canceled in 1952 korolev joined the soviet communist party that year to request money from the government for future projects including the r5 with a more modest 1200 kilometres 750 mi range it completed a first successful flight by 1953 the worlds first true intercontinental ballistic missile icbm was the r7 semyorka this was a twostage rocket with a maximum payload of 54 tons sufficient to carry the soviets bulky nuclear bomb an impressive distance of 7000 kilometres 4300 mi during the summer of 1957 the first three launches of the r7 all failed severely demoralizing korolev and his colleagues the failures also jeopardized his position and dream of using an r7 to launch an artificial satellite in the future22 the fourth test completed on 21 august 1957 was finally able to deliver a dummy payload to the kamchatka peninsula the soviet news agency tass made a brief announcement about the icbms success but it was largely ignored or dismissed by members of the american public and media22 because of korolevs success with the r7 and because the soviet union had successfully created the icbm before the united states of america he was nationally recognized by the soviet union although his name was kept secret however despite the soviet r7 initial success it experienced later failures as it was not intended to be a practical weapon21 on 19 april 1957 korolev was declared fully rehabilitated as the government acknowledged that his sentence was unjust475 korolev was keenly aware of the orbital possibilities of the rockets being designed as icbms ideas that were shared by tikhonravov then working at nii422 on 26 may 1954 six days after being tasked to lead the r7 ballistic missile program korolev submitted a proposal to use the r7 to launch a satellite into space naming a technical report from tikhonravov and mentioning similar work being carried out by americans21 after receiving lukewarm support from the soviet leadership korolev initiated a modest satellite research project in coordination with tikhonravov22 to intensify his lobbying efforts korolev along with other likeminded engineers began writing speculative articles for soviet newspapers on space flight they were picked up by the press in the united states and the cia influencing american authorities to start their own satellite programs on 29 july 1955 the eisenhower administration announced the intention of the united states to launch small earthcircling satellites for the international geophysical year22 while the us government debated the idea of spending millions of dollars on this concept korolev suggested the international prestige of launching a satellite before the united states on 5 august he sent another proposal with american newspaper articles about the us program attached three days later the soviet leadership approved his plan4849 on 30 august korolev met with members of the soviet defense and scientific communities as a result he was allowed to use the r7 rocket to launch satellites and his project also gained support from the soviet academy of sciences on 30 january 1956 the ussr council of ministers officially approved the satellite project in its decree number 14988ss22 the original plan for the satellite called for a sophisticated scientific laboratory22 nicknamed object d it would be the fifth type of payload built for the r7 missile5051 despite earlier work done by tikhonravov much of its design such as pressurized equipment longrange communications systems automated switches and a metal construct to work in space had little precedent by mid1956 korolev had finalized the modifications to the r7 icbm for a satellite launch but the project as a whole was falling behind schedule he feared that the united states would launch a satellite before he could this was heightened by reports of the american project vanguard and a secret 1956 missile launch from patrick air force base florida meanwhile testing of the r7 rocket engine showed that its specific impulse would be lower than projected and thus insufficient for object ds specifications korolev sent a revised plan calling for a simpler payload of approximately 100 kilograms it was approved on 25 january 1957 as object ps22 despite having achieved one successful flight of the r7 rocket korolev still faced opposition from some officials to his plan of launching a satellite in august 1957 he proposed letting the central committee make the call because no one wanted to risk losing the prestige to the united states korolevs satellite launch was finally approved in september a second successful flight of the r7 was made and 6 october was established as the target date for launching ps1 the first of the object pstype satellites22 the lead designer of object ps was mikhail s khomyakov and its deputy designer was oleg g ivanovskiy22 it was constructed in less than a month by the tikhonravov group48 while korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace the satellite was a simple polished metal sphere no bigger than a beach ball containing batteries that powered a transmitter using four external communication antennas korolev moved the launch date two days early fearing a preemptive launch of their own satellite by the united states22 ps1 was successfully launched into space on 4 october 1957 as sputnik 1 becoming the first artificial satellite of the earth5 for security reasons the names of chief individuals in the soviet space program became a secret they were allowed to prepare a report detailing the design and construction of sputnik 1 however which was published anonymously by pravda on 9 october korolev also began writing other articles under the pseudonym professor k sergeyev22 the soviet government initially had a lowkey response to the success of the launch international reaction was electrifying and tumultuous however which the soviets later capitalized on22 political ramifications of the accomplishment continued for decades nikita khrushchevinitially bored with the idea of another korolev rocket launchwas pleased with this success after the wide recognition and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later in time for the 40th anniversary of the october revolution on 3 november21 korolev and close associate mstislav keldysh wished to up the ante of building a second larger satellite by proposing the idea of putting a dog on board which sufficiently caught the interest of the soviet academy of sciences21 this new sputnik 2 spacecraft had six times the mass of the sputnik 1 and carried the dog laika as a payload the entire vehicle was designed from scratch within four weeks with no time for testing or quality checks it was successfully launched on 3 november and laika was placed in orbit there was no mechanism to bring the dog back to earth the dog died from heat exhaustion after five hours in space52 the instrumentladen sputnik 3 spacecraft was launched initially on 27 april 1958 but the satellite had a failure with the engine which caused the satellite to fall back down to earth in separate pieces21 on 15 may 1958 sputnik 3 was successfully launched into orbit the tape recorder that was to store the data failed after launch as a result the discovery and mapping of the van allen radiation belts was left to the united states53 explorer 354 and pioneer 3 satellites sputnik 3 left little doubt with the american government about the soviets pending icbm capability even before the sputnik 1 launch korolev was interested in getting to the moon he came up with the notion to modify the r7 missile in order to carry a package to the moon however it was not until 1958 that this idea was approved after korolev wrote a letter explaining that his current technology would make it possible to get to the moon21 a modified version of the r7 launch vehicle was used with a new upper stage the engine for this final stage was the first designed to be fired in outer space mechta is the russian word meaning dream and this is the name korolev called his moon ships officially the soviet union called them lunas21 the first three lunar probes launched in 1958 all failed in part because of political pressure forcing the launches to be rushed with an inadequate budget to test and develop the hardware properly before they were ready to fly korolev thought political infighting in moscow was responsible for the lack of sufficient funding for the program although the us space program at this early phase also had a scarcely enviable launch record once when pressured to beat the us to a working lunar probe korolev allegedly exclaimed do you think that only american rockets explode21 the luna 1 mission on 2 january 1959 was intended to impact the surface but missed by about 6000 kilometres 3700 mi nevertheless this probe became the first to reach escape velocity and the first to go near the moon as well as becoming the first manmade object to orbit the sun21 a subsequent attempt luna e1a no1 failed at launch and then luna 2 successfully impacted the surface on 14 september 1959 giving the soviets another first this was followed just one month later by an even greater success with luna 3 it was launched only two years after sputnik 1 and on 7 october 1959 was the first spacecraft to photograph the far side of the moon which was something the people of earth had never seen beforehand21 the luna missions were intended to make a successful soft landing on the moon but korolev was unable to see a success luna 4 and luna 6 both missed luna 5 luna 7 and luna 8 all crashed on the moon it was not until after korolevs death that the soviet union successfully achieved a soft landing on the moon with luna 921 towards the latter part of korolevs life he had been working on projects for reaching the planets mars and venus and even had spacecraft ready to reach both the united states was also working towards reaching these planets so it was a race to see who would be successful korolevs two initial mars probes suffered from engine failures and the five probes the soviet union launched in hopes of reaching venus all failed between 1961 and 1962 korolev himself supervised the launches of all probes21 on 1 november 1962 the soviet union successfully launched mars 1 and although communications failed was the first to complete a flyby of mars later the soviet union launched venera 3 which was the first impact of venus it was not until after korolevs death that the soviet union impacted mars21 korolevs group was also working on ambitious programs for missions to mars and venus putting a man in orbit launching communication spy and weather satellites and making a softlanding on the moon55 a radio communication center needed to be built in the crimea near simferopol and near yevpatoria to control the spacecraft56 many of these projects were not realized in his lifetime and none of the planetary probes performed a completely successful mission until after his death although he had conceived of the idea as early as 1948 korolevs planning for the piloted mission began in 1958 with design studies for the future vostok spacecraft it was to hold a single passenger in a space suit and be fully automated the space suit unlike the united states pure oxygen system was 80 percent nitrogen and only 20 percent oxygen the capsule had an escape mechanism for problems prior to launch and a softlanding and ejection system during the recovery the spacecraft was spherical just like the sputnik design and korolev explained his reasoning for this by saying the spherical shape would be more stable dynamically beginning with work on the vostok konstantin feoktistov was recruited directly by korolev to be the principal designer for crewed spaceflight vehicles21 on 15 may 1960 an uncrewed prototype performed 64 orbits of earth but the reentry maneuver failed on 28 july 1960 two dogs by the names of chaika and lishichka were launched into space but the mission was unsuccessful when an explosion killed the dogs however on 19 august the soviet union became the first to successfully recover living creatures back to earth the dogs belka and strelka were successfully launched into space on a vostok spacecraft and they completed eighteen orbits21 following this the soviet union sent a total of six dogs into space two in pairs and two paired with a dummy unfortunately not all the missions were successful after gaining approval from the government a modified version of korolevs r7 was used to launch yuri alexeevich gagarin into orbit on 12 april 1961 which was before the united states was able to put alan shepard into space21 korolev served as capsule coordinator and was able to speak to gagarin who was inside the capsule5 the first human in space and earth orbit returned to earth via a parachute after ejecting at an altitude of 7 kilometres 23000 ft57 gagarin was followed by additional vostok flights culminating with 81 orbits completed by vostok 558 and the launch of valentina tereshkova as the first woman cosmonaut in space aboard vostok 65 korolev proposed communications satellites and the vostok craft was a spinoff from the zenit spy satellite useful for photographic reconnaissance and vostok had its defense importance acknowledged by the military59 korolev planned to move forward with soyuz craft able to dock with other craft in orbit and exchange crews he was directed by khrushchev to cheaply produce more firsts for the piloted program including a multicrewed flight korolev was reported to have resisted the idea as the vostok was a oneman spacecraft and the threeman soyuz was several years away from being able to fly khrushchev was not interested in technical excuses and let it be known that if korolev could not do it he would give the work to his rival vladimir chelomey but russian space web describes this demand by khrushchev as a legend60 and challenge to apollo says that the evidence that khrushchev would have ordered these missions does not survive scrutiny61 cosmonaut alexei leonov described the authority korolev commanded at this time4 long before we met him one man dominated much of our conversation in the early days of our training sergei pavlovich korolev the mastermind behind the soviet space program he was only ever referred to by the initials of his first two names sp or by the mysterious title of chief designer or simply chief for those on the space program there was no authority higher korolev had the reputation of being a man of the highest integrity but also of being extremely demanding everyone around him was on tenterhooks afraid of making a wrong move and invoking his wrath he was treated like a god leonov recalled the first meeting between korolev and the cosmonauts62 i was looking out of the window when he arrived stepping out of a black zis 110 limousine he was taller than average i could not see his face but he had a short neck and large head he wore the collar of his darkblue overcoat turned up and the brim of his hat pulled down sit down my little eagles he said as he strode into the room where we were waiting he glanced down a list of our names and called on us in alphabetical order to introduce ourselves briefly and talk about our flying careers on august 11 1962 korolyov launched the first group flight with vostok 3 and 4 with andriyan nikolayev and pavel popovich the two spacecraft approached each other to 65 km this was based on precise calculations already at launch and not on steering maneuvering of the spacecraft during the flight at korolevs request popovich sang the ukrainian song watching the sky and thinking a thought ukrainian poem by mykhailo petrenko the first song from outer space63 the voskhod was designed as an incremental improvement on the vostok to meet khruschevs goal as a single capsule would be ineffective for proper travel to the moon the vehicle needed to be able to hold more people21 khrushchev ordered korolev to launch three people on the voskhod capsule quickly as the united states was already doing unmanned tests of the 2 person gemini korolev accepted on the condition that more backing would be given to his n1 rocket program21 one of the difficulties in the design of the voskhod was the need to land it via parachute the threeperson crew could not bail out and land by parachute so the craft would need much larger parachutes in order to land safely64 early tests with the craft resulted in some failures65 until use of stronger fabric improved parachute reliability the resulting voskhod was a strippeddown vehicle from which any excess weight had been removed although a backup retrofire engine was added since the more powerful voskhod rocket used to launch the craft would send it to a higher orbit than the vostok eliminating the possibility of a natural decay of the orbit and reentry in case of primary retrorocket failure after one uncrewed test flight this spacecraft carried a crew of three cosmonauts komarov yegorov and feoktistov into space on 12 october 1964 and completed sixteen orbits this craft was designed to perform a soft landing eliminating a need for the ejection system but the crew was sent into orbit without space suits or a launch abort system with the americans planning a spacewalk with their gemini program the soviets decided to trump them again by performing a spacewalk on the second voskhod launch after rapidly adding an airlock the voskhod 2 was launched on 18 march 1965 and alexei leonov performed the worlds first spacewalk the flight very nearly ended in disaster as leonov was just barely able to reenter through the airlock and plans for further voskhod missions were shelved in the meantime the change of soviet leadership with the fall of khrushchev meant that korolev was back in favor and given charge of beating the us to landing a man on the moon for the moon race korolevs staff started to design the immense n1 rocket in 196166 using the nk15 liquid fuel rocket engine67 he also was working on the design for the soyuz spacecraft that was intended to carry crews to leo and to the moon as well korolev was designing the luna series of vehicles that would softland on the moon and make robotic missions to mars and venus unexpectedly he died in january 1966 before he could see his various plans brought to fruition engineer sergei khrushchev son of former soviet premier nikita khrushchev explained in an interview some of the shortcomings he discerned in korolevs approach which in his opinion was why the soviets didnt land on the moon i think russia had no chance to be ahead of the americans under sergei korolev and his successor vasili mishin korolev was not a scientist not a designer he was a brilliant manager korolevs problem was his mentality his intent was to somehow use the launcher he had the n1 rocket it was designed in 1958 for a different purpose and with a limited payload of about 70 tons his philosophy was lets not work by stages as is usual in spacecraft design but lets assemble everything and then try it and at last it will work there were several attempts and failures with lunnik a series of uncrewed soviet moon probes sending man to the moon is too complicated too complex for such an approach i think it was doomed from the very beginning68 another reason the soviet crewed lunar program didnt succeed was the rivalry between korolev and vladimir chelomey their animosity was due to the intolerable persona of both men and their desire for leadership at any cost the two never said a harsh word about each other either in public or in private but toppled each others projects in any way possible instead of dividing competencies and responsibilities and cooperating in order to pursue the same goal the two struggled for leadership in the space program69 according to khrushchev who worked for chelomey and knew both men well they both would have preferred the americans to land on the moon first rather than their rival70 on 3 december 1960 korolev suffered his first heart attackcitation needed during his convalescence it was also discovered that he was suffering from a kidney disorder a condition brought on by his detention in the soviet prison campscitation needed he was warned by the doctors that if he continued to work as intensely as he had he would not live long korolev became convinced that khrushchev was only interested in the space program for its propaganda value and feared that he would cancel it entirely if the soviets started losing their leadership to the united states so he continued to push himself71 by 1962 korolevs health problems were beginning to accumulate and he was suffering from numerous ailments he had a bout of intestinal bleeding that led to him being taken to the hospital in an ambulance in 1964 doctors diagnosed him with cardiac arrhythmia in february he spent ten days in the hospital after a heart problem shortly after he was suffering from inflammation of his gallbladdercitation needed the mounting pressure of his workload was also taking a heavy toll and he was suffering from a lot of fatigue korolev was also experiencing hearing loss possibly from repeated exposure to loud rocketengine tests72 the actual circumstances of korolevs death remain somewhat uncertain in december 1965 he was supposedly diagnosed with a bleeding polyp in his large intestinecitation needed he entered the hospital on 5 january 1966 for routine surgery but died nine days later it was stated by the government that he had what turned out to be a large cancerous tumor in his abdomen but valentin glushko later reported that he actually died due to a poorly performed operation for hemorrhoidscitation needed another version states that the operation was going well when korolev started to bleed doctors tried to provide intubation to allow him to breathe freely but his jaws injured during his time in a gulag had not healed properly and impeded the installation of the breathing tube korolev died without regaining consciousness according to harford73 korolevs family confirmed the cancer story his weak heart contributed to his death during surgery7475 under a policy initiated by stalin and continued by his successors the identity of korolev was not revealed until after his death the purported reason was to protect him from foreign agents from the united states as a result the soviet people did not become aware of his accomplishments until after his death his obituary was published in the pravda newspaper on 16 january 1966 showing a photograph of korolev with all his medals korolevs ashes were interred with state honors in the kremlin wall76 korolev is comparable to wernher von braun as the leading architects of the space race77 like von braun korolev had to compete continually with rivals such as vladimir chelomey who had their own plans for flights to the moon unlike the americans he also had to work with technology that in many aspects was less advanced than what was available in the united states particularly in electronics and computers and to cope with extreme political pressure korolevs successor in the soviet space program was vasily mishin a quite competent engineer who had served as his deputy and righthand man after korolev died mishin became the chief designer and he inherited what turned out to be a flawed n1 rocket program in 1972 mishin was fired and then replaced by a rival valentin glushko after all four n1 test launches failed by that time the rival americans had already made it to the moon and so the program was canceled by cpsu general secretary leonid brezhnev the soviet migr leonid vladimirov related the following description of korolev by valentin glushko at about this time short of stature heavily built with head sitting awkwardly on his body with brown eyes glistening with intelligence he was a skeptic a cynic and a pessimist who took the gloomiest view of the future we are all going to be shot and there will be no obituary khlopnut bez nekrologa ie we will all vanish without a trace was his favorite expression lev kerber78 korolev rarely drank alcohol and lived a fairly austere lifestyle79 his career also contributed to instability in his personal life about 1946 the marriage of korolev and vincentini began to break up vincentini was heavily occupied with her own career and about this time korolev had an affair with a younger woman named nina ivanovna kotenkova who was an english interpreter in the podlipki office21 vincentini who still loved korolev and was angry over the infidelity divorced him in 1948 korolev and kotenkova were married in 1949 but he is known to have had affairs even after this second marriage korolevs passion for his work was a characteristic that made him a great leader he was committed to training younger engineers to move into his space and missile projects even while consumed with his own work korolev knew that students would be the future of space exploration which is why he made such an effort to communicate with them21 arkady ostashev was one of korolevs students who korolev hired to do dissertation work before later becoming an engineer and working on the r221 korolev an engineer by training was able to navigate the unpredictable and dangerous soviet politics of moscow secure funding and support of leadership to the cause that was only vaguely defined space exploration create a shared vision to sell the idea to an extended set of disparate stakeholders and create an entirely new segment of science among his awards korolev was twice honored as hero of socialist labour in 1956 and 1961 he was also a lenin prize winner in 197180 and was awarded the order of lenin three times the order of the badge of honour and the medal for labour valour in 1958 he was elected to the academy of sciences of the ussr in 1969 and 1986 the ussr issued 10 kopek postage stamps honoring korolev81 in addition he was made an honorary citizen of korolyov and received the medal in commemoration of the 800th anniversary of moscow sergei khrushchev claimed that his father nikita rejected a nobel prize for korolev out of concern that the award would anger the rest of the council of chief designers82 in 1990 korolev was inducted into the international air space hall of fame at the san diego air space museum83 a street in moscow was named after korolev in 1966 and is now called ulitsa akademika korolyova academician korolyov street the memorial homemuseum of akademician spkorolyov was established in 1975 in the house where korolev lived from 1959 till 1966 moscow 6th ostankinsky lane22884 in 1976 he was inducted into the international space hall of fame80 the town of kaliningrad historic name podlipki moscow region was renamed korolev in honour of korolev in 1996 there is now an oversized statue of korolev located in the town square the town is the home of rsc energia the largest space company in russia rsc energia was also renamed to sp korolev rocket
