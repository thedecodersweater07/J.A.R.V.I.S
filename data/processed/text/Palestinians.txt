palestinians arabic romanized alfilasniyyn are an arab ethnonational group native to the levantine region of palestine35363738 they represent a highly homogeneous community who share one cultural and ethnic identity394041 speak palestinian arabic and share close religious linguistic and cultural ties with other levantine arabs in 1919 palestinian muslims and christians constituted 90 percent of the population of palestine just before the third wave of jewish immigration and the setting up of british mandatory palestine after world war i4243 opposition to jewish immigration spurred the consolidation of a unified national identity though palestinian society was still fragmented by regional class religious and family differences4445 the history of the palestinian national identity is a disputed issue amongst scholars4647 for some the term palestinian is used to refer to the nationalist concept of a palestinian people by palestinian arabs from the late 19th century and in the preworld war i period while others assert the palestinian identity encompasses the heritage of all eras from biblical times up to the ottoman period384849 after the israeli declaration of independence the 1948 palestinian expulsion and more so after the 1967 palestinian exodus the term palestinian evolved into a sense of a shared future in the form of aspirations for a palestinian state38 founded in 1964 the palestine liberation organization is an umbrella organization for groups that represent the palestinian people before international states50 the palestinian national authority officially established in 1994 as a result of the oslo accords is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in palestinian population centres in the west bank and the gaza strip51 since 1978 the united nations has observed an annual international day of solidarity with the palestinian people according to british historian perry anderson it is estimated that half of the population in the palestinian territories are refugees52 despite various wars and exoduses roughly one half of the worlds palestinian population continues to reside in the territory of former mandatory palestine now encompassing israel and the occupied palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza strip53 in israel proper palestinians constitute almost 21 percent of the population as part of its arab citizens54 many are palestinian refugees or internally displaced palestinians including over 14 million in the gaza strip2 over 870000 in the west bank55 and around 250000 in israel proper of the palestinian population who live abroad known as the palestinian diaspora more than half are stateless lacking legal citizenship in any country56 23 million of the diaspora population are registered as refugees in neighboring jordan most of whom hold jordanian citizenship657 over 1 million live between syria and lebanon and about 750000 live in saudi arabia with chile holding the largest palestinian diaspora concentration around half a million outside of the arab world the greek toponym palaistn which is the origin of the arabic filasn first occurs in the work of the 5th century bce greek historian herodotus where it denotes generally58 the coastal land from phoenicia down to egypt5960 herodotus also employs the term as an ethnonym as when he speaks of the syrians of palestine or palestiniansyrians61 an ethnically amorphous group he distinguishes from the phoenicians6263 herodotus makes no distinction between the inhabitants of palestine64 the greek word reflects an ancient eastern mediterraneannear eastern word which was used either as a toponym or ethnonym in ancient egyptian pelesetpurusati65 has been conjectured to refer to the sea peoples particularly the philistines6667 among semitic languages akkadian palatu variant pilitu is used of 7thcentury philistia and its by then four city states68 biblical hebrews cognate word plitim is usually translated philistines65 when the romans conquered the region in the first century bce they used the name judaea for the province that covered most of the region at the same time the name syria palestina continued to be used by historians and geographers to refer to the area between the mediterranean sea and the jordan river as in the writings of philo josephus and pliny the elder during the early 2nd century ce syria palaestina became the official administrative name in a move viewed by scholars as an attempt by emperor hadrian to disassociate jews from the land as punishment for the bar kokhba revolt697071 jacobson suggested the change to be rationalized by the fact that the new province was far larger72 the name was thenceforth inscribed on coins and beginning in the fifth century mentioned in rabbinic texts697374 the arabic word filastin has been used to refer to the region since the time of the earliest medieval arab geographers it appears to have been used as an arabic adjectival noun in the region since as early as the 7th century75 in modern times the first person to selfdescribe palestines arabs as palestinians was khalil beidas in 1898 followed by salim qubain and najib nassar in 1902 after the 1908 young turk revolution which eased press censorship laws in the ottoman empire dozens of newspapers and periodicals were founded in palestine and the term palestinian expanded in usage among those were the alquds almunadi falastin alkarmil and alnafir newspapers which used the term filastini more than 170 times in 110 articles from 1908 to 1914 they also made references to a palestinian society palestinian nation and a palestinian diaspora article writers included christian and muslim arab palestinians palestinian emigrants and nonpalestinian arabs7677 the palestinian arab christian falastin newspaper had addressed its readers as palestinians since its inception in 1911 during the ottoman period7879 during the mandatory palestine period the term palestinian was used to refer to all people residing there regardless of religion or ethnicity and those granted citizenship by the british mandatory authorities were granted palestinian citizenship80 other examples include the use of the term palestine regiment to refer to the jewish infantry brigade group of the british army during world war ii and the term palestinian talmud which is an alternative name of the jerusalem talmud used mainly in academic sources following the 1948 establishment of israel the use and application of the terms palestine and palestinian by and to palestinian jews largely dropped from use for example the englishlanguage newspaper the palestine post founded by jews in 1932 changed its name in 1950 to the jerusalem post the term arab jews can include jews with palestinian heritage and israeli citizenship although some arab jews prefer to be called mizrahi jews nonjewish arab citizens of israel with palestinian heritage identify themselves as arabs or palestinians81 these nonjewish arab israelis thus include those that are palestinian by heritage but israeli by citizenship82 the palestinian national charter as amended by the plos palestinian national council in july 1968 defined palestinians as those arab nationals who until 1947 normally resided in palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or stayed there anyone born after that date of a palestinian father whether in palestine or outside it is also a palestinian83 note that arab nationals is not religiousspecific and it includes not only the arabicspeaking muslims of palestine but also the arab christians and other religious communities of palestine who were at that time arabicspeakers such as the samaritans and druze thus the jews of palestine wereare also included although limited only to the arabicspeaking jews who had normally resided in palestine until the beginning of the prestate zionist invasion the charter also states that palestine with the boundaries it had during the british mandate is an indivisible territorial unit8384 historical records and later genetic studies indicate that the palestinian people descend mostly from ancient levantines extending back to bronze age inhabitants of levant85868788899091 according to palestinian historian nazmi aljubeh like in other arab nations the arab identity of palestinians largely based on linguistic and cultural affiliation is independent of the existence of any actual arabian origins92 palestinians are sometimes described as indigenous35 in a human rights context the word indigenous may have different definitions the un commission on human rights uses several criteria to define this term93b palestine has undergone many demographic and religious upheavals throughout history during the 2nd millennium bce it was inhabited by the canaanites semiticspeaking peoples who practiced the canaanite religion95 most palestinians share a strong genetic link to the ancient canaanites9697 israelites later emerged as an outgrowth of southern canaanite civilization with jews and israelite samaritans eventually forming the majority of the population in palestine during classical antiquity9899100101102103 however the jewish population in jerusalem and its surroundings in judea and samaritan population in samaria never fully recovered as a result of the jewishroman wars and samaritan revolts respectively104 in the centuries that followed the region experienced political and economic unrest and the religious persecution of minorities105106 mass conversions to christianity and the subsequent christianization of the roman empire along with the emigration of pagans jews and samaritans contributed to a christian majority forming in late roman and byzantine palestine107108109110 in the 7th century the arab rashiduns conquered the levant they were later succeeded by other arab muslim dynasties including the umayyads abbasids and the fatimids111 over the following several centuries the population of palestine drastically decreased from an estimated 1 million during the roman and byzantine periods to about 300000 by the early ottoman period112113 over time the existing population adopted arab culture and language and much converted to islam108 the settlement of arabs before and after the muslim conquest is thought to have played a role in accelerating the islamization process114115116117 some scholars suggest that by the arrival of the crusaders palestine was already overwhelmingly muslim118119 while others claim that it was only after the crusades that the christians lost their majority and that the process of mass islamization took place much later perhaps during the mamluk period114120 for several centuries during the ottoman period the population in palestine declined and fluctuated between 150000 and 250000 inhabitants and it was only in the 19th century that a rapid population growth began to occur121 this growth was aided by the immigration of egyptians during the reigns of muhammad ali and ibrahim pasha and algerians following abdelkader el djezaris revolt in the first half of the 19th century and the subsequent immigration of algerians bosnians and circassians during the second half of the century122123 between 1871 and 1945 around a dozen villages were established by immigrants124 many palestinian villagers claim ancestral ties to arab tribes from the arabian peninsula that settled in palestine during or after the muslim conquest of the levant125 some palestinian families notably in the hebron and nablus regions claim jewish and samaritan ancestry respectively preserving associated cultural customs and traditions126127128 early farming populations in the levant iran and anatolia have significantly influenced modernday western asian genomes130 a 2020 study compared the genomewide data of modernday palestinians and other populations in the levant with various ancient population samples recovered from archaeological sites it suggested that palestinians along with other modernday populations in the levant have ancestry from southern levant populations from the bronze and iron ages associated with canaanite culture along with migrants from the caucasus or zagros area dating back to around 2500 to 1000 bce86 lazaridis et al 2022 clarified that ancient levantines and their descendants exhibit a decrease of 8 local neolithic ancestry which is mostly natufian every millennium starting from the prepottery neolithic to the medieval period it was largely replaced by caucasusrelated and anatolianrelated ancestries from the north and west respectively however despite the decline in the natufian component this key ancestry source made an important contribution to peoples of later periods continuing until the present131 genetic studies indicate a genetic affinity between palestinians and other arab and semitic groups in the middle east and north africa88132 a 2003 study which looked into mitochondrial dna and y chromosome variations in african and west asian populations suggested that there are indications within palestinian populations of maternal gene flow from subsaharan africa possibly linked to historical migrations or the arab slave trade133 genetic studies have also shown a genetic relationship between palestinians and jews8513487 a 2023 study which looked at the whole genomes of modernday ethnic groups around the world found that the palestinian samples clustered in the middle eastern genomic group this group included samples from populations such as samaritans bedouins jordanians iraqi jews and yemenite jews129 the timing and causes behind the emergence of a distinctively palestinian national identity among the arabs of palestine are matters of scholarly disagreement some argue that it can be traced as far back as the peasants revolt in palestine in 1834 or even as early as the 17th century while others argue that it did not emerge until after the mandatory palestine period46135 legal historian assaf likhovski states that the prevailing view is that palestinian identity originated in the early decades of the 20th century46 when an embryonic desire among palestinians for selfgovernment in the face of generalized fears that zionism would lead to a jewish state and the dispossession of the arab majority crystallised among most editors christian and muslim of local newspapers136 the term itself filasn was first introduced by khall beidas in a translation of a russian work on the holy land into arabic in 1898 after that its usage gradually spread so that by 1908 with the loosening of censorship controls under late ottoman rule a number of muslim christian and jewish correspondents writing for newspapers began to use the term with great frequency in referring to the palestinian people ahlahl filasn palestinians alfilasnyn the sons of palestine abn filasn or to palestinian society almujtama alfilasn137 whatever the differing viewpoints over the timing causal mechanisms and orientation of palestinian nationalism by the early 20th century strong opposition to zionism and evidence of a burgeoning nationalistic palestinian identity is found in the content of arabiclanguage newspapers in palestine such as alkarmil est 1908 and filasteen est 1911138 filasteen initially focused its critique of zionism around the failure of the ottoman administration to control jewish immigration and the large influx of foreigners later exploring the impact of zionist landpurchases on palestinian peasants arabic fellahin expressing growing concern over land dispossession and its implications for the society at large138 historian rashid khalidis 1997 book palestinian identity the construction of modern national consciousness is considered a foundational text on the subject139 he notes that the archaeological strata that denote the history of palestine encompassing the biblical roman byzantine umayyad abbasid fatimid crusader ayyubid mamluk and ottoman periods form part of the identity of the modernday palestinian people as they have come to understand it over the last century49 noting that palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one with arabism religion and local loyalties playing an important role khalidi cautions against the efforts of some extreme advocates of palestinian nationalism to anachronistically read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact relatively modern140141 khalidi argues that the modern national identity of palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among the peoples of the ottoman empire in the late 19th century that sharpened following the demarcation of modern nationstate boundaries in the middle east after world war i141 khalidi also states that although the challenge posed by zionism played a role in shaping this identity that it is a serious mistake to suggest that palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to zionism141 conversely historian james l gelvin argues that palestinian nationalism was a direct reaction to zionism in his book the israelpalestine conflict one hundred years of war he states that palestinian nationalism emerged during the interwar period in response to zionist immigration and settlement143 gelvin argues that this fact does not make the palestinian identity any less legitimate the fact that palestinian nationalism developed later than zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than zionism all nationalisms arise in opposition to some other why else would there be the need to specify who you are and all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose143 david seddon writes that the creation of palestinian identity in its contemporary sense was formed essentially during the 1960s with the creation of the palestine liberation organization he adds however that the existence of a population with a recognizably similar name the philistines in biblical times suggests a degree of continuity over a long historical period much as the israelites of the bible suggest a long historical continuity in the same region144 baruch kimmerling and joel s migdal consider the 1834 peasants revolt in palestine as constituting the first formative event of the palestinian people from 1516 to 1917 palestine was ruled by the ottoman empire save a decade from the 1830s to the 1840s when an egyptian vassal of the ottomans muhammad ali and his son ibrahim pasha successfully broke away from ottoman leadership and conquering territory spreading from egypt to as far north as damascus asserted their own rule over the area the socalled peasants revolt by palestines arabs was precipitated by heavy demands for conscripts the local leaders and urban notables were unhappy about the loss of traditional privileges while the peasants were well aware that conscription was little more than a death sentence starting in may 1834 the rebels took many cities among them jerusalem hebron and nablus and ibrahim pashas army was deployed defeating the last rebels on 4 august in hebron145 benny morris argues that the arabs in palestine nevertheless remained part of a larger national panarab or alternatively panislamist movement146 walid khalidi argues otherwise writing that palestinians in ottoman times were acutely aware of the distinctiveness of palestinian history and although proud of their arab heritage and ancestry the palestinians considered themselves to be descended not only from arab conquerors of the seventh century but also from indigenous peoples who had lived in the country since time immemorial including the ancient hebrews and the canaanites before them147 zachary j foster argued in a 2015 foreign affairs article that based on hundreds of manuscripts islamic court records books magazines and newspapers from the ottoman period 15161918 it seems that the first arab to use the term palestinian was farid georges kassab a beirutbased orthodox christian he explained further that kassabs 1909 book palestine hellenism and clericalism noted in passing that the orthodox palestinian ottomans call themselves arabs and are in fact arabs despite describing the arabic speakers of palestine as palestinians throughout the rest of the book148 bernard lewis argues it was not as a palestinian nation that the arabs of ottoman palestine objected to zionists since the very concept of such a nation was unknown to the arabs of the area at the time and did not come into being until very much later even the concept of arab nationalism in the arab provinces of the ottoman empire had not reached significant proportions before the outbreak of world war i48 tamir sorek a sociologist submits that although a distinct palestinian identity can be traced back at least to the middle of the nineteenth century kimmerling and migdal 1993 khalidi 1997b or even to the seventeenth century gerber 1998 it was not until after world war i that a broad range of optional political affiliations became relevant for the arabs of palestine135 israeli historian efraim karsh takes the view that the palestinian identity did not develop until after the 1967 war because the palestinian exodusexpulsion had fractured society so greatly that it was impossible to piece together a national identity between 1948 and 1967 the jordanians and other arab countries hosting arab refugees from palestineisrael silenced any expression of palestinian identity and occupied their lands until israels conquests of 1967 the formal annexation of the west bank by jordan in 1950 and the subsequent granting of its palestinian residents jordanian citizenship further stunted the growth of a palestinian national identity by integrating them into jordanian society149 the idea of a unique palestinian state distinct from its arab neighbors was at first rejected by palestinian representatives the first congress of muslimchristian associations in jerusalem february 1919 which met for the purpose of selecting a palestinian arab representative for the paris peace conference adopted the following resolution we consider palestine as part of arab syria as it has never been separated from it at any time we are connected with it by national religious linguistic natural economic and geographical bonds150 an independent palestinian state has not exercised full sovereignty over the land in which the palestinians have lived during the modern era palestine was administered by the ottoman empire until world war i and then overseen by the british mandatory authorities israel was established in parts of palestine in 1948 and in the wake of the 1948 arabisraeli war the west bank was ruled by jordan and the gaza strip by egypt with both countries continuing to administer these areas until israel occupied them in the sixday war historian avi shlaim states that the palestinians lack of sovereignty over the land has been used by israelis to deny palestinians their rights to selfdetermination151 today the right of the palestinian people to selfdetermination has been affirmed by the united nations general assembly the international court of justice152 and several israeli authorities153 a total of 133 countries recognize palestine as a state154 however palestinian sovereignty over the areas claimed as part of the palestinian state remains limited and the boundaries of the state remain a point of contestation between palestinians and israelis the first palestinian nationalist organizations emerged at the end of the world war i155 two political factions emerged almuntada aladabi dominated by the nashashibi family militated for the promotion of the arabic language and culture for the defense of islamic values and for an independent syria and palestine in damascus alnadi alarabi dominated by the husayni family defended the same values156 article 22 of the covenant of the league of nations conferred an international legal status upon the territories and people which had ceased to be under the sovereignty of the ottoman empire as part of a sacred trust of civilization article 7 of the league of nations mandate required the establishment of a new separate palestinian nationality for the inhabitants this meant that palestinians did not become british citizens and that palestine was not annexed into the british dominions157 the mandate document divided the population into jewish and nonjewish and britain the mandatory power considered the palestinian population to be composed of religious not national groups consequently government censuses in 1922 and 1931 would categorize palestinians confessionally as muslims christians and jews with the category of arab absent158 the articles of the mandate mentioned the civil and religious rights of the nonjewish communities in palestine but not their political status at the san remo conference it was decided to accept the text of those articles while inserting in the minutes of the conference an undertaking by the mandatory power that this would not involve the surrender of any of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the nonjewish communities in palestine in 1922 the british authorities over mandatory palestine proposed a draft constitution that would have granted the palestinian arabs representation in a legislative council on condition that they accept the terms of the mandate the palestine arab delegation rejected the proposal as wholly unsatisfactory noting that the people of palestine could not accept the inclusion of the balfour declaration in the constitutions preamble as the basis for discussions they further took issue with the designation of palestine as a british colony of the lowest order159 the arabs tried to get the british to offer an arab legal establishment again roughly ten years later but to no avail160 after the british general louis bols read out the balfour declaration in february 1920 some 1500 palestinians demonstrated in the streets of jerusalem161 a month later during the 1920 nebi musa riots the protests against british rule and jewish immigration became violent and bols banned all demonstrations in may 1921 however further antijewish riots broke out in jaffa and dozens of arabs and jews were killed in the confrontations161 after the 1920 nebi musa riots the san remo conference and the failure of faisal to establish the kingdom of greater syria a distinctive form of palestinian arab nationalism took root between april and july 1920162163 with the fall of the ottoman empire and the french conquest of syria coupled with the british conquest and administration of palestine the formerly pansyrianist mayor of jerusalem musa qasim pasha alhusayni said now after the recent events in damascus we have to effect a complete change in our plans here southern syria no longer exists we must defend palestine164 conflict between palestinian nationalists and various types of panarabists continued during the british mandate but the latter became increasingly marginalized two prominent leaders of the palestinian nationalists were mohammad amin alhusayni grand mufti of jerusalem appointed by the british and izz addin alqassam161 after the killing of sheikh izz addin alqassam by the british in 1935 his followers initiated the 193639 arab revolt in palestine which began with a general strike in jaffa and attacks on jewish and british installations in nablus161 the arab higher committee called for a nationwide general strike nonpayment of taxes and the closure of municipal governments and demanded an end to jewish immigration and a ban of the sale of land to jews by the end of 1936 the movement had become a national revolt and resistance grew during 1937 and 1938 in response the british declared martial law dissolved the arab high committee and arrested officials from the supreme muslim council who were behind the revolt by 1939 5000 arabs had been killed in british attempts to quash the revolt more than 15000 were wounded161 in november 1947 the united nations general assembly adopted the partition plan which divided the mandate of palestine into two states one majority arab and one majority jewish the palestinian arabs rejected the plan and attacked jewish civilian areas and paramilitary targets following israels declaration of independence in may 1948 five arab armies lebanon egypt syria iraq and transjordan came to the palestinian arabs aid against the newly founded state of israel165 the palestinian arabs suffered such a major defeat at the end of the war that the term they use to describe the war is nakba the catastrophe166 israel took control of much of the territory that would have been allocated to the arab state had the palestinian arabs accepted the un partition plan165 along with a military defeat hundreds of thousands of palestinians fled or were expelled from what became the state of israel israel did not allow the palestinian refugees of the war to return to israel167 after the war there was a hiatus in palestinian political activity khalidi attributes this to the traumatic events of 194749 which included the depopulation of over 400 towns and villages and the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees168 418 villages had been razed 46367 buildings 123 schools 1233 mosques 8 churches and 68 holy shrines many with a long history destroyed by israeli forces169 in addition palestinians lost from 15 to 2 million acres of land an estimated 150000 urban and rural homes and 23000 commercial structures such as shops and offices170 recent estimates of the cost to palestinians in property confiscations by israel from 1948 onwards has concluded that under international law the fair value of compensation to palestinians would total 300 billion in 20082009 prices52 those parts of british mandatory palestine which did not become part of the newly declared israeli state were occupied by egypt or annexed by jordan at the jericho conference on 1 december 1948 2000 palestinian delegates supported a resolution calling for the unification of palestine and transjordan as a step toward full arab unity171 during what khalidi terms the lost years that followed palestinians lacked a center of gravity divided as they were between these countries and others such as syria lebanon and elsewhere172 in the 1950s a new generation of palestinian nationalist groups and movements began to organize clandestinely stepping out onto the public stage in the 1960s173 the traditional palestinian elite who had dominated negotiations with the british and the zionists in the mandate and who were largely held responsible for the loss of palestine were replaced by these new movements whose recruits generally came from poor to middleclass backgrounds and were often students or recent graduates of universities in cairo beirut and damascus173 the potency of the panarabist ideology put forward by gamal abdel nasserpopular among palestinians for whom arabism was already an important component of their identity174tended to obscure the identities of the separate arab states it subsumed175 since 1967 palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip have lived under military occupation creating according to avram bornstein a carceralization of their society176 in the meantime panarabism has waned as an aspect of palestinian identity the israeli occupation of the gaza strip and west bank triggered a second palestinian exodus and fractured palestinian political and militant groups prompting them to give up residual hopes in panarabism they rallied increasingly around the palestine liberation organization plo which had been formed in cairo in 1964 the group grew in popularity in the following years especially under the nationalistic orientation of the leadership of yasser arafat177 mainstream secular palestinian nationalism was grouped together under the umbrella of the plo whose constituent organizations include fatah and the popular front for the liberation of palestine among other groups who at that time believed that political violence was the only way to liberate palestine49 these groups gave voice to a tradition that emerged in the 1960s that argues palestinian nationalism has deep historical roots with extreme advocates reading a palestinian nationalist consciousness and identity back into the history of palestine over the past few centuries and even millennia when such a consciousness is in fact relatively modern178 the battle of karameh and the events of black september in jordan contributed to growing palestinian support for these groups particularly among palestinians in exile concurrently among palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip a new ideological theme known as sumud represented the palestinian political strategy popularly adopted from 1967 onward as a concept closely related to the land agriculture and indigenousness the ideal image of the palestinian put forward at this time was that of the peasant in arabic fellah who stayed put on his land refusing to leave a strategy more passive than that adopted by the palestinian fedayeen sumud provided an important subtext to the narrative of the fighters in symbolizing continuity and connections with the land with peasantry and a rural way of life179 in 1974 the plo was recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people by the arab nationstates and was granted observer status as a national liberation movement by the united nations that same year50180 israel rejected the resolution calling it shameful181 in a speech to the knesset deputy premier and foreign minister yigal allon outlined the governments view that no one can expect us to recognize the terrorist organization called the plo as representing the palestiniansbecause it does not no one can expect us to negotiate with the heads of terrorgangs who through their ideology and actions endeavor to liquidate the state of israel181 in 1975 the united nations established a subsidiary organ the committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the palestinian people to recommend a program of implementation to enable the palestinian people to exercise national independence and their rights to selfdetermination without external interference national independence and sovereignty and to return to their homes and property182 the first intifada 198793 was the first popular uprising against the israeli occupation of 1967 followed by the plos 1988 proclamation of a state of palestine these developments served to further reinforce the palestinian national identity after the gulf war in 1991 kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200000 palestinians to leave kuwait183 the policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of plo leader yasser arafat with saddam hussein the oslo accords the first israelipalestinian interim peace agreement were signed in 1993 the process was envisioned to last five years ending in june 1999 when the withdrawal of israeli forces from the gaza strip and the jericho area began the expiration of this term without the recognition by israel of the palestinian state and without the effective termination of the occupation was followed by the second intifada in 2000184185 the second intifada was more violent than the first186 the international court of justice observed that since the government of israel had decided to recognize the plo as the representative of the palestinian people their existence was no longer an issue the court noted that the israelipalestinian interim agreement on the west bank and the gaza strip of 28 september 1995 also referred a number of times to the palestinian people and its legitimate rights187 according to thomas giegerich with respect to the palestinian peoples right to form a sovereign independent state the right of selfdetermination gives the palestinian people collectively the inalienable right freely to determine its political status while israel having recognized the palestinians as a separate people is obliged to promote and respect this right in conformity with the charter of the united nations188 following the failures of the second intifada a younger generation is emerging that cares less about nationalist ideology than about economic growth this has been a source of tension between some of the palestinian political leadership and palestinian business professionals who desire economic cooperation with israelis at an international conference in bahrain palestinian businessman ashraf jabari said i have no problem working with israel it is time to move on the palestinian authority does not want peace they told the families of the businessmen that they are wanted by police for participating in the bahrain workshop189 in the absence of a comprehensive census including all palestinian diaspora populations and those that have remained within what was british mandate palestine exact population figures are difficult to determine the palestinian central bureau of statistics pcbs announced at the end of 2015 that the number of palestinians worldwide at the end of 2015 was 1237 million of which the number still residing within historic palestine was 622 million193 in 2022 arnon soffer estimated that in the territory of former mandatory palestine now encompassing israel and the palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza strip theres a palestinian population of 7503 million making up 5116 of the total population194195 within israel proper palestinians constitute almost 21 percent of the population as part of its arab citizens54 in 2005 a critical review of the pcbs figures and methodology was conducted by the americanisrael demographic research group aidrg196 in their report197 they claimed that several errors in the pcbs methodology and assumptions artificially inflated the numbers by a total of 13 million the pcbs numbers were crosschecked against a variety of other sources eg asserted birth rates based on fertility rate assumptions for a given year were checked against palestinian ministry of health figures as well as ministry of education school enrollment figures six years later immigration numbers were checked against numbers collected at border crossings etc the errors claimed in their analysis included birth rate errors 308000 immigration emigration errors 310000 failure to account for migration to israel 105000 doublecounting jerusalem arabs 210000 counting former residents now living abroad 325000 and other discrepancies 82000 the results of their research was also presented before the united states house of representatives on 8 march 2006198 the study was criticised by sergio dellapergola a demographer at the hebrew university of jerusalem199 dellapergola accused the authors of the aidrg report of misunderstanding basic principles of demography on account of their lack of expertise in the subject but he also acknowledged that he did not take into account the emigration of palestinians and thinks it has to be examined as well as the birth and mortality statistics of the palestinian authority200 he also accused aidrg of selective use of data and multiple systematic errors in their analysis claiming that the authors assumed the palestinian electoral registry to be complete even though registration is voluntary and they used an unrealistically low total fertility ratio a statistical abstraction of births per woman to reanalyse that data in a typical circular mistake dellapergola estimated the palestinian population of the west bank and gaza at the end of 2005 as 333 million or 357 million if east jerusalem is included these figures are only slightly lower than the official palestinian figures199 the israeli civil administration put the number of palestinians in the west bank at 2657029 as of may 2012201202 the aidrg study was also criticized by ian lustick who accused its authors of multiple methodological errors and a political agenda203 in 2009 at the request of the plo jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of palestinians to keep them from remaining permanently in the country204 many palestinians have settled in the united states particularly in the chicago area205206 in total an estimated 600000 palestinians are thought to reside in the americas palestinian emigration to south america began for economic reasons that predated the arabisraeli conflict but continued to grow thereafter207 many emigrants were from the bethlehem area those emigrating to latin america were mainly christian half of those of palestinian origin in latin america live in chile10 el salvador208 and honduras209 also have substantial palestinian populations these two countries have had presidents of palestinian ancestry antonio saca in el salvador and carlos roberto flores in honduras belize which has a smaller palestinian population has a palestinian minister said musa210 schafik jorge handal salvadoran politician and former guerrilla leader was the son of palestinian immigrants211 in 2006 there were 4255120 palestinians registered as refugees with the united nations relief and works agency unrwa this number includes the descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled during the 1948 war but excludes those who have since then emigrated to areas outside of unrwas remit212 based on these figures almost half of all palestinians are registered refugees the 993818 palestinian refugees in the gaza strip and 705207 palestinian refugees in the west bank who hail from towns and villages now located within the borders of israel are included in these figures213 unrwa figures do not include some 274000 people or 1 in 55 of all arab residents of israel who are internally displaced palestinian refugees214215 palestinian refugee camps in lebanon syria jordan and the west bank are organized according to a refugee familys village or place of origin among the first things that children born in the camps learn is the name of their village of origin david mcdowall writes that a yearning for palestine permeates the whole refugee community and is most ardently espoused by the younger refugees for whom home exists only in the imagination216 israeli policy to prevent the refugees from returning to their homes was initially formulated by david ben gurion and joseph weitz director of the jewish national fund was formally adopted by the israeli cabinet in june 1948217 in december of that year the un adopted resolution 194 which resolved that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which under principles of international law or in equity should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible218219220 despite much of the international community including the us president harry truman insisting that the repatriation of palestinian refugees was essential israel refused to accept the principle220 in the intervening years israel has consistently refused to change its position and has introduced further legislation to hinder palestinians refugees from returning and reclaiming their land and confiscated property219220 in keeping with an arab league resolution in 1965 most arab countries have refused to grant citizenship to palestinians arguing that it would be a threat to their right of return to their homes in palestine219221 in 2012 egypt deviated from this practice by granting citizenship to 50000 palestinians mostly from the gaza strip221 palestinians living in lebanon are deprived of basic civil rights they cannot own homes or land and are barred from becoming lawyers engineers and doctors222 the majority of palestinians are muslim223 the vast majority of whom are followers of the sunni branch of islam224 with a small minority of ahmadiyya225 palestinian christians represent a significant minority of 6 and belong to several denominations followed by much smaller religious communities including druze and samaritans palestinian jews considered palestinian by the palestinian national charter adopted by the palestine liberation organization plo which defined them as those jews who had normally resided in palestine until the beginning of the zionist invasion today identify as israelis226 with the exception of a very few individuals palestinian jews almost universally abandoned any such identity after the establishment of israel and their incorporation into the israeli jewish population which was originally composed of jewish immigrants from around the world until the end of the 19th century crosscultural syncretism between islamic and christian symbols and figures in religious practice was common in the palestinian countryside where most villages did not have local mosques or churches227 popular feast days such as thursday of the dead were celebrated by both muslims and christians and shared prophets and saints include jonah who is venerated in halhul as both a biblical and islamic prophet and st george who is known in arabic as alkhdir villagers would pay tribute to local patron saints at maqams domed single rooms often placed in the shadow of an ancient carob or oak tree many of them are rooted in jewish samaritan christian and sometimes pagan traditions228 saints taboo by the standards of orthodox islam mediated between man and god and shrines to saints and holy men dotted the palestinian landscape227 ali qleibo a palestinian anthropologist states that this built evidence constitutes an architectural testimony to christianmoslem palestinian religious sensibility and its roots in ancient semitic religions227 religion as constitutive of individual identity was accorded a minor role within palestinian social structure until the latter half of the 19th century227 jean moretain a priest writing in 1848 wrote that a christian in palestine was distinguished only by the fact that he belonged to a particular clan if a certain tribe was christian then an individual would be christian but without knowledge of what distinguished his faith from that of a muslim227 the concessions granted to france and other western powers by the ottoman sultanate in the aftermath of the crimean war had a significant impact on contemporary palestinian religious cultural identity227 religion was transformed into an element constituting the individualcollective identity in conformity with orthodox precepts and formed a major building block in the political development of palestinian nationalism227 the british census of 1922 registered 752048 inhabitants in palestine consisting of 660641 palestinian arabs muslim and christian arabs 83790 palestinian jews and 7617 persons belonging to other groups the corresponding percentage breakdown is 87 muslim and christian arab and 11 jewish229 bernard sabella of bethlehem university estimates that 6 of the palestinian population worldwide is christian and that 56 of them live outside of historic palestine230 according to the palestinian academic society for the study of international affairs the palestinian population of the west bank and gaza strip is 97 muslim and 3 christian the vast majority of the palestinian community in chile follow christianity largely eastern orthodox and some roman catholic and in fact the number of palestinian christians in the diaspora in chile alone exceeds the number of those who have remained in their homeland231 saint george is the patron saint of the palestinian christians232 the druze became israeli citizens and druze males serve in the israel defense forces though some individuals identify as palestinian druze233 according to salih alshaykh most druze do not consider themselves to be palestinian their arab identity emanates in the main from the common language and their sociocultural background but is detached from any national political conception it is not directed at arab countries or arab nationality or the palestinian people and does not express sharing any fate with them from this point of view their identity is israel and this identity is stronger than their arab identity234 there are also about 350 samaritans who carry palestinian identity cards and live in the west bank while a roughly equal number live in holon and carry israeli citizenship235 those who live in the west bank also are represented in the legislature for the palestinian national authority235 they are commonly referred to among palestinians as the jews of palestine and maintain their own unique cultural identity235 jews who identify as palestinian jews are few but include israeli jews who are part of the neturei karta group236 and uri davis an israeli citizen and selfdescribed palestinian jew who converted to islam in 2008 in order to marry miyassar abu ali who serves as an observer member in the palestine national council237 bahullh founder of the bah faith spent his last years in acre then part of the ottoman empire he remained there for 24 years where a shrine was erected in his honor238239 according to the pcbs there are an estimated 4816503 palestinians in the palestinian territories as of 2016update of whom 2935368 live in the west bank and 1881135 in the gaza strip240 according to the israel central bureau of statistics there were 1658000 arab citizens of israel as of 2013241 both figures include palestinians in east jerusalem in 2008 minority rights group international estimated the number of palestinians in jordan to be about 3 million242 the unrwa put their number at 23 million as of 2024update6 palestinian arabic is a subgroup of the broader levantine arabic dialect prior to the 7th century islamic conquest and arabization of the levant the primary languages spoken in palestine among the predominantly christian and jewish communities were aramaic greek and syriac243 arabic was also spoken in some areas244 palestinian arabic like other variations of the levantine dialect exhibits substantial influences in lexicon from aramaic245 palestinian arabic has three primary subvariations rural urban and bedouin with the pronunciation of the qf serving as a shibboleth to distinguish between the three main palestinian subdialects the urban variety notes a q sound while the rural variety spoken in the villages around major cities have a k for the q the bedouin variety of palestine spoken mainly in the southern region and along the jordan valley use a g instead of q246 barbara mckean parmenter has noted that the arabs of palestine have been credited with the preservation of the original semitic place names of many sites mentioned in the bible as was documented by the american geographer edward robinson in the 19th century247 palestinians who live or work in israel generally can also speak modern hebrew as do some who live in the west bank and gaza strip the literacy rate of palestine was 963 according to a 2014 report by the united nations development programme which is high by international standards there is a gender difference in the population aged above 15 with 59 of women considered illiterate compared to 16 of men248 illiteracy among women has fallen from 203 in 1997 to less than 6 in 2014248 palestinian intellectuals among them may ziadeh and khalil beidas were an integral part of the arab intelligentsiawhen educational levels among palestinians have traditionally been high in the 1960s the west bank had a higher percentage of its adolescent population enrolled in high school education than did lebanon249 claude cheysson frances minister for foreign affairs under the first mitterrand presidency held in the mideighties that even thirty years ago palestinians probably already had the largest educated elite of all the arab peoples250 contributions to palestinian culture have been made by diaspora figures including edward said and ghada karmi arab citizens of israel including emile habibi and jordanians including ibrahim nasrallah251252 in the 19th and early 20th century there were some well known palestinian families which included the khalidi family the alhusayni family the nashashibi family the tuqan family the nusaybah family qudwa family shawish clan shurrab family alzaghab family alkhalil family ridwan dynasty alzeitawi family abu ghosh clan barghouti family doghmush clan douaihy family hilles clan jarrar family and the jayyusi family since various conflicts with zionists began some of the communities have subsequently left palestine the role of women varies among palestinians with both progressive and ultraconservative opinions existing other groups of palestinians such as the negev bedouins or druze may no longer selfidentify as palestinian for political reasons253 ali qleibo a palestinian anthropologist has critiqued muslim historiography for assigning the beginning of palestinian cultural identity to the advent of islam in the 7th century in describing the effect of such historiography he writes pagan origins are disavowed as such the peoples who populated palestine throughout history have discursively rescinded their own history and religion as they adopted the religion language and culture of islam227 that the peasant culture of the large fellahin class showed features of cultures other than islam was a conclusion arrived at by some western scholars and explorers who mapped and surveyed palestine during the latter half of the 19th century254 and these ideas were to influence 20thcentury debates on palestinian identity by local and international ethnographers the contributions of the nativist ethnographies produced by tawfiq canaan and other palestinian writers and published in the journal of the palestine oriental society 192048 were driven by the concern that the native culture of palestine and in particular peasant society was being undermined by the forces of modernity255 salim tamari writes that implicit in their scholarship and made explicit by canaan himself was another theme namely that the peasants of palestine representthrough their folk norms the living heritage of all the accumulated ancient cultures that had appeared in palestine principally the canaanite philistine hebraic nabatean syrioaramaic and arab255 palestinian culture is closely related to those of the nearby levantine countries such as lebanon syria and jordan and the arab world cultural contributions to the fields of art literature music costume and cuisine express the characteristics of the palestinian experience and show signs of common origin despite the geographical separation between the palestinian territories israel and the diaspora256257258 alquds capital of arab culture is an initiative undertaken by unesco under the cultural capitals program to promote arab culture and encourage cooperation in the arab region the opening event was launched in march 2009 palestines history of rule by many different empires is reflected in palestinian cuisine which has benefited from various cultural contributions and exchanges generally speaking modern syrianpalestinian dishes have been influenced by the rule of three major islamic groups the arabs the persianinfluenced arabs and the turks259 the arabs who conquered syria and palestine had simple culinary traditions primarily based on the use of rice lamb and yogurt as well as dates260 the already simple cuisine did not advance for centuries due to islams strict rules of parsimony and restraint until the rise of the abbasids who established baghdad as their capital baghdad was historically located on persian soil and henceforth persian culture was integrated into arab culture during the 9th11th centuries and spread throughout central areas of the empire259 there are several foods native to palestine that are well known in the arab world such as kinafe nabulsi nabulsi cheese cheese of nablus ackawi cheese cheese of acre and musakhan kinafe originated in nablus as well as the sweetened nabulsi cheese used to fill itcitation needed another very popular food is palestinian kofta or kufta261 mezze describes an assortment of dishes laid out on the table for a meal that takes place over several hours a characteristic common to mediterranean cultures some common mezze dishes are hummus taboulehbaba ghanoush labaneh and zate u zaatar which is the pita bread dipping of olive oil and ground thyme and sesame seeds262 entres that are eaten throughout the palestinian territories include waraq alinib boiled grape leaves wrapped around cooked rice and ground lamb mahashi is an assortment of stuffed vegetables such as zucchinis potatoes cabbage and in gaza chard263 similar to the structure of palestinian society the palestinian field of arts extends over four main geographic centers the west bank and gaza strip israel the palestinian diaspora in the arab world and the palestinian diaspora in europe the united states and elsewhere264 palestinian cinematography relatively young compared to arab cinema overall receives much european and israeli support265 palestinian films are not exclusively produced in arabic some are made in english french or hebrew266 more than 800 films have been produced about palestinians the israelipalestinian conflict and other related topics267 examples include divine intervention and paradise now a wide variety of handicrafts many of which have been produced in the area of palestine for hundreds of years continue to be produced today palestinian handicrafts include embroidery and weaving potterymaking soapmaking glassmaking and olivewood and mother of pearl carvings among others268269 foreign travelers to palestine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the areas inhabitants and particularly among the fellaheen or village women until the 1940s a womans economic status whether married or single and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most palestinian women by the type of cloth colors cut and embroidery motifs or lack thereof used for the robelike dress or thoub in arabic270 new styles began to appear in the 1960s for example the sixbranched dress named after the six wide bands of embroidery running down from the waist271 these styles came from the refugee camps particularly after 1967 individual village styles were lost and replaced by an identifiable palestinian style272 the shawal a style popular in the west bank and jordan before the first intifada probably evolved from one of the many welfare embroidery projects in the refugee camps it was a shorter and narrower fashion with a western cut273 palestinian literature forms part of the wider genre of arabic literature unlike its arabic counterparts palestinian literature is defined by national affiliation rather than territorially for example egyptian literature is the literature produced in egypt this too was the case for palestinian literature up to the 1948 arabisraeli war but following the palestinian exodus of 1948 it has become a literature written by palestinians regardless of their residential status274275 contemporary palestinian literature is often characterized by its heightened sense of irony and the exploration of existential themes and issues of identity275 references to the subjects of resistance to occupation exile loss and love and longing for homeland are also common276 palestinian literature can be intensely political as underlined by writers such as salma khadra jayyusi and novelist liana badr who have mentioned the need to give expression to the palestinian collective identity and the just case of their struggle277 there is also resistance to this school of thought whereby palestinian artists have rebelled against the demand that their art be committed277 poet mourid barghouti for example has often said that poetry is not a civil servant its not a soldier its in nobodys employ277 rula jebreals novel miral tells the story of hind alhusseinis effort to establish an orphanage in jerusalem after the 1948 arabisraeli war the deir yassin massacre278279 and the establishment of the state of israel since 1967 most critics have theorized the existence of three branches of palestinian literature loosely divided by geographic location 1 from inside israel 2 from the occupied territories 3 from among the palestinian diaspora throughout the middle east280 hannah amitkochavi recognizes only two branches that written by palestinians from inside the state of israel as distinct from that written outside ibid p 11274 she also posits a temporal distinction between literature produced before 1948 and that produced thereafter274 in a 2003 article published in studies in the humanities steven salaita posits a fourth branch made up of english language works particularly those written by palestinians in the united states which he defines as writing rooted in diasporic countries but focused in theme and content on palestine280 poetry using classical preislamic forms remains an extremely popular art form often attracting palestinian audiences in the thousands until 20 years ago local folk bards reciting traditional verses were a feature of every palestinian town281 after the 1948 palestinian exodus and discrimination by neighboring arab countries poetry was transformed into a vehicle for political activism166 from among those palestinians who became arab citizens of israel after the passage of the citizenship law in 1952 a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets including mahmoud darwish samih alqasim and tawfiq zayyad281 the work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between israel and arab governments the situation changed after ghassan kanafani another palestinian writer in exile in lebanon published an anthology of their work in 1966281 palestinian poets often write about the common theme of a strong affection and sense of loss and longing for a lost homeland281 among the new generation of palestinian writers the work of nathalie handal an awardwinning poet playwright and editor has been widely published in literary journals and magazines and has been translated into twelve languages282 palestinian folklore is the body of expressive culture including tales music dance legends oral history proverbs jokes popular beliefs customs and comprising the traditions including oral traditions of palestinian culture there was a folklorist revival among palestinian intellectuals such as nimr sirhan musa allush salim mubayyid and the palestinian folklore society during the 1970s this group attempted to establish preislamic and prehebraic cultural roots for a reconstructed palestinian national identity the two putative roots in this patrimony are canaanite and jebusite255 such efforts seem to have borne fruit as evidenced in the organization of celebrations including the qabatiya canaanite festival and the annual music festival of yabus by the palestinian ministry of culture255 traditional storytelling among palestinians is prefaced with an invitation to the listeners to give blessings to god and the prophet mohammed or the virgin mary as the case may be and includes the traditional opening there was or there was not in the oldness of time281283 formulaic elements of the stories share much in common with the wider arab world though the rhyming scheme is distinct there are a cast of supernatural characters djinns who can cross the seven seas in an instant giants and ghouls with eyes of ember and teeth of brass stories invariably have a happy ending and the storyteller will usually finish off with a rhyme like the bird has taken flight god bless you tonight or tutu tutu finished is my haduttu story281 palestinian music is well known throughout the arab world285 after 1948 a new wave of performers emerged with distinctively palestinian themes relating to dreams of statehood and burgeoning nationalist sentiments in addition to zajal and ataaba traditional palestinian songs include bein aldawai alrozana zarif altoul and almaijana dalona sahjasaamir zaghareet over three decades the palestinian national music and dance troupe el funoun and mohsen subhi have reinterpreted and rearranged traditional wedding songs such as mishal 1986 marj ibn amer1989 and zaghareed 1997286 ataaba is a form of folk singing that consists of four verses following a specific form and meter the distinguishing feature of ataaba is that the first three verses end with the same word meaning three different things and the fourth verse serves as a conclusion it is usually followed by a dalouna reem kelani is one of the foremost researchers and performers in the present day of music with a specifically palestinian narrative and heritage287 her 2006 debut solo album sprinting gazelle palestinian songs from the motherland and the diaspora comprised kelanis research and an arrangement of five traditional palestinian songs whilst the other five songs were her own musical settings of popular and resistance poetry by the likes of mahmoud darwish salma khadra jayyusi rashid husain and mahmoud salim alhout288 all the songs on the album relate to pre1948 palestine palestinian hip hop reportedly started in 1998 with tamer nafars group dam289 these palestinian youth forged the new palestinian musical subgenre which blends arabic melodies and hip hop beats lyrics are often sung in arabic hebrew english and sometimes french since then the new palestinian musical subgenre has grown to include artists in the palestinian territories israel great britain the united states and canada borrowing from traditional rap music that first emerged in new york in the 1970s young palestinian musicians have tailored the style to express their own grievances with the social and political climate in which they live and work palestinian hip hop works to challenge stereotypes and instigate dialogue about the israelipalestinian conflict290 palestinian hiphop artists have been strongly influenced by the messages of american rappers tamar nafar says when i heard tupac sing its a white mans world i decided to take hip hop seriously291 in addition to the influences from american hip hop it also includes musical elements from palestinian and arabic music including zajal mawwal and saj which can be likened to arabic spoken word as well as including the percussiveness and lyricism of arabic music historically music has served as an integral accompaniment to various social and religious rituals and ceremonies in palestinian society altaee 47 much of the middleeastern and arabic string instruments utilized in classical palestinian music are sampled over hiphop beats in both israeli and palestinian hiphop as part of a joint process of localization just as the percussiveness of the hebrew language is emphasized in israeli hiphop palestinian music has always revolved around the rhythmic specificity and smooth melodic tone of arabic musically speaking palestinian songs are usually pure melody performed monophonically with complex vocal ornamentations and strong percussive rhythm beats292 the presence of a handdrum in classical palestinian music indicates a cultural esthetic conducive to the vocal verbal and instrumental percussion which serve as the foundational elements of hiphop this hip hop is joining a longer tradition of revolutionary underground arabic music and political songs that have supported palestinian resistance291 this subgenre has served as a way to politicize the palestinian issue through music the dabke a levantine arab folk dance style whose local palestinian versions were appropriated by palestinian nationalism after 1967 has according to one scholar possible roots that may go back to ancient canaanite fertility rites293 it is marked by synchronized jumping stamping and movement similar to tap dancing one version is performed by men another by women although sport facilities did exist before the 1948 palestinian expulsion and flight many such facilities and institutions were subsequently shut down today there remains sport centers such as in gaza and ramallah but the difficulty of mobility and travel restrictions means most palestinian are not able to compete internationally to their full potential however palestinian sport authorities have indicated that palestinians in the diaspora will be eligible to compete for palestine once the diplomatic and security situation improves
