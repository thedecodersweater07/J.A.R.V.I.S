the alps at an altitude of about 520 m 1706 ft asl the local rivers are the isar and the wrm munich is situated in the northern alpine foreland the northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the alps while the southern part is covered with morainic hills between these are fields of fluvioglacial outwash such as around munich wherever these deposits get thinner the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area leading to marshes as in the north of munich according to the kppen climate classification the climate is oceanic cfb independent of the isotherm but with some humid continental dfb features like warm to hot summers and cold winters but without permanent snow cover109110 the city centre lies between both climates while the airport of munich has a humid continental climate the warmest month on average is july the coolest is january the proximity to the alps brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to flood problems studies of adaptation to climate change and extreme events are carried out one of them is the isar plan of the eu adaptation climate111 showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer the most precipitation occurs in july on average winter tends to have less precipitation the least in february the higher elevation and proximity to the alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of germany the alps affect the

snow january is the coldest month while winter averages remain only moderately cold and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of munichs latitude inversion from the nearby alps causes cold air to sink and result in temperatures below 15 c 5 f in munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm with daytime temperatures averaging 25 c 77 f munich is subject to active convective seasons and sometimes damaging events the alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range or detaches heading eastnortheast over the foothills of the alps112 at munichs official weather stations the

further rise in medium temperature a higher number of heat extremes a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 c tropical nights a change in precipitation patterns as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change the city administration decided to support a joint study from its own referat fr gesundheit und umwelt department for health and environmental issues and the german meteorological service that will gather data on local weather the data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in munich with the help of those programs issues regarding spatial
