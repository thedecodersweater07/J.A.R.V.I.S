applied science is the application of the scientific method and scientific knowledge to attain practical goals it includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering and medicine applied science is often contrasted with basic science which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena2 there are applied natural sciences as well as applied formal and social sciences3 applied science examples include genetic epidemiology which applies statistics and probability theory and applied psychology including criminology4 applied research is the use of empirical methods to collect data for practical purposes it accesses and uses accumulated theories knowledge methods and techniques for a specific state business or clientdriven purpose in contrast to engineering applied research does not include analyses or optimization of business economics and costs applied research can be better understood in any area when contrasting it with basic or pure research basic geographical research strives to create new theories and methods that aid in explaining the processes that shape the spatial structure of physical or human environments instead applied research utilizes existing geographical theories and methods to comprehend and address particular empirical issues5 applied research usually has specific commercial objectives related to products procedures or services6 the comparison of pure research and applied research provides a basic framework and direction for businesses to follow7 applied research deals with solving practical problems8 and generally employs empirical methodologies because applied research resides in the messy real world strict research protocols may need to be relaxed for example it may be impossible to use a random sample thus transparency in the methodology is crucial implications for the interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered9 moreover this type of research method applies natural sciences to human conditions10 since applied research has a provisional closetotheproblem and closetothedata orientation it may also use a more provisional conceptual framework such as working hypotheses or pillar questions1213 the oecds frascati manual14 describes applied research as one of the three forms of research along with basic research experimental development15 due to its practical focus applied research information will be found in the literature associated with individual disciplines16 applied research is a method of problemsolving and is also practical in areas of science such as its presence in applied psychology applied psychology uses human behavior to grab information to locate a main focus in an area that can contribute to finding a resolution17 more specifically this study is applied in the area of criminal psychology with the knowledge obtained from applied research studies are conducted on criminals alongside their behavior to apprehend them18 moreover the research extends to criminal investigations under this category research methods demonstrate an understanding of the scientific method and social research designs used in criminological research these reach more branches along the procedure towards the investigations alongside laws policy and criminological theorycitation needed engineering is the practice of using natural science mathematics and the engineering design process to solve technical problems increase efficiency and productivity and improve systems the discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics applied science and types of application engineering is often characterized as having four main branches chemical engineering civil engineering electrical engineering and mechanical engineering some scientific subfields used by engineers include thermodynamics heat transfer fluid mechanics statics dynamics mechanics of materials kinematics electromagnetism materials science earth sciences and engineering physicscitation needed medical sciences such as medical microbiology pharmaceutical research and clinical virology are applied sciences that apply biology and chemistry to medicine in canada the netherlands and other places the bachelor of applied science basc is sometimes equivalent to the bachelor of engineering and is classified as a professional degree this is based on the age of the school where applied science used to include boiler making surveying and engineering there are also bachelor of applied science degrees in child studies the basc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences in australia and new zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degreecitation needed in the united kingdoms educational system applied science refers to a suite of vocational science qualifications that run alongside traditional general certificate of secondary education or alevel sciences19 applied science courses generally contain more coursework also known as portfolio or internally assessed work compared to their traditional counterparts these are an evolution of the gnvq qualifications offered up to 2005 these courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the wolf report 201120 however their merits are argued elsewhere21 in the united states the college of william mary offers an undergraduate minor as well as master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in applied science courses and research cover varied fields including neuroscience optics materials science and engineering nondestructive testing and nuclear magnetic resonance22 university of nebraskalincoln offers a bachelor of science in applied science an online completion bachelor of science in applied science and a master of applied science coursework is centered on science agriculture and natural resources with a wide range of options including ecology food genetics entrepreneurship economics policy animal science and plant science23 in new york city the bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of cornelltechnion 100 million in city capital to construct the universities proposed applied sciences campus on roosevelt island24
