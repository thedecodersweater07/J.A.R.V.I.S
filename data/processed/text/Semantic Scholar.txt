semantic scholar is a research tool for scientific literature it is developed at the allen institute for ai and was publicly released in november 20152 semantic scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers3 the semantic scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing machine learning humancomputer interaction and information retrieval4 semantic scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science geoscience and neuroscience5 in 2017 the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus5 as of september 2022update it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science6 semantic scholar provides a onesentence summary of scientific literature one of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices7 it also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read8 artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper generating it through an abstractive technique3 the project uses a combination of machine learning natural language processing and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis and to extract relevant figures tables entities and venues from papers910 another key aipowered feature is research feeds an adaptive research recommender that uses ai to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date it uses a stateoftheart paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each library folder11 semantic scholar also offers semantic reader an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual12 semantic reader provides inline citation cards that allow users to see citations with tldr short for too long didnt read automatically generated short summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster in contrast with google scholar and pubmed semantic scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper13 the ai technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics14 like the previously cited search engines semantic scholar also exploits graph structures which include the microsoft academic knowledge graph springer natures scigraph and the semantic scholar corpus originally a 45 million papers corpus in computer science neuroscience and biomedicine1516 each paper hosted by semantic scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the semantic scholar corpus id abbreviated s2cid the following entry is an example liu ying gayle albert a wildersmith annelies rocklv joacim march 2020 the reproductive number of covid19 is higher compared to sars coronavirus journal of travel medicine 27 2 doi101093jtmtaaa021 pmid 32052846 s2cid 211099356 semantic scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines ie google scholar does not search for material that is behind a paywall5better source needed one study compared the index scope of semantic scholar to google scholar and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science the two indices had comparable coverage each only missing a handful of the papers17 as of january 2018 following a 2017 project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries the semantic scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from computer science and biomedicine18 in march 2018 doug raymond who developed machine learning initiatives for the amazon alexa platform was hired to lead the semantic scholar project19 as of august 2019update the number of included papers metadata not the actual pdfs had grown to more than 173 million20 after the addition of the microsoft academic graph records21 in 2020 a partnership between semantic scholar and the university of chicago press journals made all articles published under the university of chicago press available in the semantic scholar corpus22 at the end of 2020 semantic scholar had indexed 190 million papers23 in 2020 semantic scholar reached seven million users per month7
