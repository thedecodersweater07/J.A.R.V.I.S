reports along with 260 journalists of its own france 24 can call on the resources of the two main french broadcasters groupe tf1 and france tlvisions as well as partners such as afp and rfi in 2016 france 24 started sharing its french language nighttime programming with the francebased france info according to mariechristine saragosse president and ceo of france mdias monde part of the value added of this public channel would be the fact that france 24 journalists will be wide awake while others would be sleeping8 the channel was created with the backing of president jacques chirac with the aim of providing a french perspective of the news which was dominated by englishlanguage media outlets9 in 1986 then french prime minister jacques chirac expressed his desire for an international television news channel in french and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from france radio france internationale tv5 and to a certain extent rseau france outremer and noted the collective offering was fragmented disorganised and ineffective with the arrival of franois mitterrand as president in 1981 and the naming of michel rocard as prime minister in 1989 the government launched a new project canal france international cfi a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in french for foreign audiences particularly in africa to be developed in parallel as a television channel the first gulf war of 1990 relayed across the world by cnn international in particular revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion a parliamentary minister philippe sguin wished to create a frenchlanguage equivalent in 1996 to 1999 after nineteen governmental reports in ten years prime minister alain jupp asked radio france internationale president jeanpaul cluzel who was also general inspector of finances to create a french international news channel cluzel proposed in 1998 to group tv5 rfi and cfi within a corporation entitled tlfi the umpled government decided to follow that recommendation but with the return of the socialist party to government and the nomination of hubert vdrine the new minister of foreign affairs favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as tv5 which started to produce its own programming notably its news bulletins which in turn created its own news team additionally with the creation of euronews in 1993 with frenchlanguage commentary the media presence of france overseas became more complex more fragmented and costlier without being able to rely on a true roundtheclock international news channel in 2002 president jacques chirac relaunched the project to create a french international news channel is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the frenchlanguage media on the international scene admittedly we have with agence francepresse a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce notably in its international mission indeed everyone here recognises the recent progress made by rfi by tv5 by cfi thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies but everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in french capable of competing with the bbc or cnn president jacques chirac address given at an lyse palace reception on 12 february 2002 in honour of the high council of the francophonie10 the recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers a cultural area which doesnt possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves let us question in the time of terrestrial television networks of satellite of the internet on our organisation in this domain and notably in the dissipation of public funds which are reserved to them on 7 march speaking in the french senate in front of foreign delegates to france and as part of his presidential campaign chirac said we must have the ambition of a big roundtheclock news channel in french equal to the bbc or cnn for the englishspeaking world it is essential for the influence of our country for our expatriates it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland11 after his reelection the first reflections were engaged at the ministry of foreign affairs headed by dominique de villepin various technical options were examined at the time in an unreleased report the subsequent wars in afghanistan and iraq reassured the authorities about the project especially in february 2003 when the american broadcasters cnn fox news and msnbc opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the united nations security council after dominique de villepin gave his address on the iraq conflict12 on 19 march 2003 matignon opened offers to elicit the development of an international news channel broadcasting primarily in the french language this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of france in the worldwide battle of images and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs by its culture and by its own ideas and to value its historical links and its privileged geography the international news channel must contribute to a longlasting strategy of influence of france in the world13 by the application deadline on 22 april 2003 three candidates replied one month later a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the national assembly to form a publicowned corporation groupement dintrt public grouping all of the public broadcasters france tlvisions rfo rfi tv5 and afp with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004 ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission the government asked a member of the assembly bernard brochand to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel something which the parliamentary commission did not demand brochard unsuccessfully attempted to group both groupe tf1 and groupe canal he then proposed a 5050 partnership between france tlvisions and groupe tf1 whilst at the same time rejecting rfi both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally tf1 with its lci channel and france tlvisions editorial teams at france 2 and france 3 after a press conference in january 2004 president chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year however various disputes began to surface the ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework unionised journalists working for france tlvisions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector calling it the marriage of the snake and the rabbit radio france international was angry that it would not be associated with the project a headline published in le monde described the partnership having a public channel private owner14 while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro compared with 600 million euro for bbc world finally the minister for foreign affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as tv5 facing discontentment the cabinet of prime minister jeanpierre raffarin delayed all discussion of the project in 2004 then foreign minister michel barnier announced on 21 july that the channel would not be funded before 2007 which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the finance bill however the prime minister acceded to pressure from the lyse a press conference by raffarin on 9 december confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005 i have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by france tlvisions and tf1 as desired by the president the new channel will draw on the talents of major french television companies and will promote the expression of a french vision more necessary than ever in the world today the government will present an amendment to the finance bill to provide for the start of the channel to a total of 30 million euro15 the amendment was carried the same day in the national assembly the start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the european union and the relevant competition commissions trade union members working for france tlvisions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in march 2005 the newly elected president of the public corporation patrick de carolis who assumed his position in the summer and who had been accused of being too close to the president expressed doubts about an alliance with tf1 to be effective you need a single driver in a car16 he insisted that the channel be made available within france which the members of parliament required and which tf1 wanting to protect its own news channel lci could object to patrick le lay president of tf1 gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties and eventually a supervisory board devolved to france tlvisions these few amendments needed new authorisation from the french and european authorities obtained this time round without difficulty the launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the ministry of culture and communication headed by renaud donnedieu de vabres on 30 november 2005 the project of the international french news channel abbreviated in french to cfii will allow us to propose our own countrys vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world17 alain de pouzilhac former ceo of havas was named president along with two deputies one each
