massachusetts locations cambridge from 1922 to 1928 newton until 1941 waltham until 1961 and lexington until 20038 in 1922 vannevar bush scientist and professor in the department of electrical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology mit along with engineer and physicist laurence k marshall and scientist charles g smith founded the american appliance company in cambridge massachusetts9 its focus which was originally on new refrigeration technology soon shifted to electronics the companys first product was a gaseous helium voltageregulator tube that was based on charles smiths earlier astronomical research of the star zeta puppis10 the electron tube was named raytheon a compound of old french and greek meaning light from the gods11 and was used in a battery eliminator a type of radioreceiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries this made it possible to convert household alternating current to a regulated high voltage direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive shortlived batteries in 1925 the company changed its name to raytheon manufacturing company and began marketing its rectifier under the raytheon brand name with commercial success in 1928 raytheon merged with qrs company an american manufacturer of electron tubes and switches to form the successor of the same name raytheon manufacturing companycitation needed by the 1930s it had already grown to become one of the worlds largest vacuum tube manufacturing companiescitation needed in 1933 it diversified by acquiring acmedelta company a producer of transformers power equipment and electronic auto partscitation needed early in world war ii physicists in the united kingdom invented the magnetron a specialized microwavegenerating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft american companies were then sought by the us government to perfect and massproduce the magnetron for groundbased airborne and shipborne radar systems and with support from the massachusetts institute of technologys radiation laboratory recently formed to investigate microwave radar raytheon received a contract to build the devices within a few months raytheon began to manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems during the war raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems particularly for submarine detection raytheon was also a contractor for the massproduction of miniature shockresistant vacuum tubes used in proximity fuses these tubes were difficult to manufacture and required rigorous attention to detail12 at wars end in 1945 the company had built about 80 percent of all magnetrons raytheon ranked 71st among us corporations in the value of world war ii military production contracts13 in 1945 raytheons percy spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food in 1947 the company demonstrated the radarange microwave oven for commercial use14 during the postwar years raytheon also made generally low to mediumpowered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market but the highpowered market was solidly in the hands of larger betterfinanced competitors such as continental electronics general electric and radio corporation of america in 1946 the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the submarine signal company founded in 1901 a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment with its broadened capabilities raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target in 1948 charles francis adams iv was appointed president of the company and served until 1960 in 1948 raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles in 1950 its lark became the first such missile to destroy a target aircraft in flight raytheon then received

as well as a broad range of mission support services raytheons electronics and defensesystems units produce air sea and landlaunched missiles aircraft radar systems weapons sights and targeting systems communication and battlemanagement systems and satellite components raytheon is a developer and manufacturer of radars including aesas electrooptical sensors and other advanced electronics systems for airborne naval and ground based military applications examples include raytheon often in conjunction with boeing lockheed martin or northrop grumman is also heavily involved in the satellite sensor business much of its space and airborne systems division in el segundo california is devoted to this a business it inherited from hughes examples of programs include as part of the companys growing homeland security business and strategic focus raytheon has teamed with other contractors to develop an advance spectroscopic portal asp to allow border officials to view and identify radioactive materials in vehicles and shipping containers more effectively50 raytheon also manufactures semiconductors for the electronics industry in sites in the us and uk in the late 20th century it produced a wide range of integrated circuits and other components but as of 2003 its us semiconductor business specializes in gallium arsenide gaas components for radio communications as well as infrared detectors it is also making efforts to develop gallium nitride gan components for nextgeneration radars and radios the uk arm specialized in cmos on silicon carbide sic development and foundry work but is no longer taking on new orders having been on the premises for 57 years in the framework of groundbased midcourse defense raytheon is developing a ground based interceptor gbi that includes a booster missile and a kinetic exoatmospheric kill vehicle ekv along with several key radar components such as the seabased xband radar sbx and the upgraded early warning radar uewr raytheon is a developer of missiles and related missile defense systems these include two lawsuits were filed against a raytheon company plant in st petersburg florida in april 2008 accusing the company of allowing toxic waste into the groundwater for fifteen years52 raytheon was given until the end of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated according to the florida department of environmental protection dep the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants including trichloroethylene 14dioxane and vinyl chloride53 the dep also reported that the cloudy groundwater contained other toxins such as lead and toluene52 in 1995 raytheon acquired dallasbased esystems including a site in st petersburg florida in november 1991 prior to raytheons acquisition contamination had been discovered at the esystems site soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and 14dioxane in 2005 groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site54 according to dep documentation raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report therefore it was given a deadline on may 31 2008 to investigate its groundwater52 contamination in the area has not affected anyones drinking water supply or health yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against raytheon citing decreases in property values55 in another case raytheon was ordered by the environmental protection agency epa to treat groundwater at the tucson plant acquired during the merger with hughes in arizona since raytheon used and disposed metals chlorinated solvents and other substances at the plant since 195156 the epa further required the installation and operation of an oxidation process system to treat the solvents and make the water safe to drink56 on august 9 2006 the stream contact centre in derry northern ireland which had a contract with raytheon at the time was attacked by protesters they destroyed the computers documents and mainframe of the office and proceeded to occupy it for eight
