apollo 1 initially designated as204 was planned to be the first crewed mission of the apollo program1 the american undertaking to land the first man on the moon it was planned to launch on february 21 1967 as the first low earth orbital test of the apollo command and service module the mission never flew a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test at cape kennedy air force station launch complex 34 on january 27 killed all three crew memberscommand pilot gus grissom senior pilot ed white and pilot roger b chaffeeand destroyed the command module cm the name apollo 1 chosen by the crew was made official by nasa in their honor after the fire immediately after the fire nasa convened an accident review board to determine the cause of the fire and both chambers of the united states congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee nasas investigation the ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material and the highpressure pure oxygen cabin atmosphere rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch which could not be opened against the internal pressure of the cabin because the rocket was unfueled the test had not been considered hazardous and emergency preparedness for it was poor during the congressional investigation senator walter mondale publicly revealed a nasa internal document citing problems with prime apollo contractor north american aviation which became known as the phillips report this disclosure embarrassed nasa administrator james e webb who was unaware of the documents existence and attracted controversy to the apollo program despite congressional displeasure at nasas lack of openness both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident crewed apollo flights were suspended for twenty months while the command modules hazards were addressed however the development and uncrewed testing of the lunar module lm and saturn v rocket continued the saturn ib launch vehicle for apollo 1 as204 was used for the first lm test flight apollo 5 the first successful crewed apollo mission was flown by apollo 1s backup crew on apollo 7 in october 1968 as204 was to be the first crewed test flight of the apollo command and service module csm to earth orbit launched on a saturn ib rocket as204 was to test launch operations ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the apollosaturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks depending on how the spacecraft performed3 the csm for this flight number 012 built by north american aviation naa was a block i version designed before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen therefore it lacked the capability of docking with the lunar module this was incorporated into the block ii csm design along with lessons learned in block i block ii would be testflown with the lm when the latter was ready4 director of flight crew operations deke slayton selected the first apollo crew in january 1966 with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn f eisele as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc135 weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january 27 slayton replaced him with chaffee5 and nasa announced the crew selection on march 21 1966 james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart were named as the backup crew6 on september 29 walter schirra eisele and walter cunningham were named as the prime crew for a second block i csm flight as2057 nasa planned to follow this with an uncrewed test flight of the lm as206 then the third crewed mission would be a dual flight designated as278 or as207208 in which as207 would launch the first crewed block ii csm which would then rendezvous and dock with the lm launched uncrewed on as2088 in march nasa was studying the possibility of flying the first apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final project gemini mission gemini 12 in november 19669 but by may delays in making apollo ready for flight just by itself and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the gemini made that impractical10 this became moot when slippage in readiness of the as204 spacecraft caused the lastquarter 1966 target date to be missed and the mission was rescheduled for february 21 196711 in october 1966 nasa announced the flight would carry a small television camera to broadcast live from the command module the camera would also be used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecrafts instrument panel in flight12 television cameras were carried aboard all crewed apollo missions13 grissoms crew received approval in june 1966 to design a mission patch with the name apollo 1 though the approval was subsequently withdrawn pending a final decision on the mission designation which was not resolved until after the fire the designs center depicts a command and service module flying over the southeastern united states with florida the launch point prominent the moon is seen in the distance symbolic of the eventual program goal a yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes trimmed in gold the insignia was designed by the crew with the artwork done by north american aviation employee allen stevens1415 the apollo command and service module was much bigger and far more complex than any previous crewed spacecraft in october 1963 joseph f shea was named apollo spacecraft program office aspo manager responsible for managing the design and construction of both the csm and the lm in a spacecraft review meeting held with shea on august 19 1966 a week before delivery the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material mainly nylon netting and velcro in the cabin which both astronauts and technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place although shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer with the inscription it isnt that we dont trust you joe but this time weve decided to go over your head16 184 shea gave his staff orders to tell north american to remove the flammables from the cabin but did not supervise the issue personally16 185 north american shipped spacecraft cm012 to kennedy space center on august 26 1966 under a conditional certificate of flight worthiness 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to be completed at ksc that was not all an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery17 63 grissom became so frustrated with the inability of the training simulator engineers to keep up with the spacecraft changes that he took a lemon from a tree by his house18 and hung it on the simulator7 the command and service modules were mated in the ksc altitude chamber in september and combined system testing was performed altitude testing was performed first uncrewed then with both the prime and backup crews from october 10 through december 30 during this testing the environmental control unit in the command module was found to have a design flaw and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework the returned ecu then leaked waterglycol coolant and had to be returned a second time also during this time a propellant tank in another service module had ruptured during testing at naa prompting the removal from the ksc test chamber of the service module so it could be tested for signs of the tank problem these tests were negative in december the second block i flight as205 was canceled as unnecessary schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for apollo 1 mcdivitts crew was now promoted to prime crew of the block iilm mission redesignated as258 because the as205 launch vehicle would be used in place of as207 a third crewed mission was planned to launch the csm and lm together on a saturn v as503 to an elliptical medium earth orbit meo to be crewed by frank borman michael collins and william anders mcdivitt scott and schweickart had started their training for as258 in cm101 at the naa plant in downey california when the apollo 1 accident occurred19 once all outstanding csm012 hardware problems had been fixed the reassembled spacecraft completed a successful altitude chamber test with schirras backup crew on december 3017 42 according to the final report of the accident investigation board at the posttest debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft17 42 this would appear to contradict the account given in the 1994 book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo 13 by jeffrey kluger and astronaut james lovell that when the trio climbed out of the ship schirra made it clear that he was not pleased with what he had seen and that he later warned grissom and shea that theres nothing wrong with this ship that i can point to but it just makes me uncomfortable something about it just doesnt ring right and that grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble20 after the successful altitude tests the spacecraft was removed from the altitude chamber on january 3 1967 and mated to its saturn ib launch vehicle on pad 34 on january 6 grissom said in a february 1963 interview that nasa could not eliminate risk despite precautions21 an awful lot of people have devoted more effort than i can describe to make project mercury and its successors as safe as humanly possible but we also recognize that there remains a great deal of risk especially in initial operations regardless of planning you just cant forecast all the things that could happen or when they could happen i suppose that someday we are going to have a failure in every other business there are failures and they are bound to happen sooner or later he added21 grissom was asked about the fear of potential catastrophe in a december 1966 interview22 you sort of have to put that out of your mind theres always a possibility that you can have a catastrophic failure of course this can happen on any flight it can happen on the last one as well as the first one so you just plan as best you can to take care of all these eventualities and you get a welltrained crew and you go fly the launch simulation on january 27 1967 on pad 34 was a plugsout test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on simulated internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals passing this test was essential to making the february 21 launch date the test was considered nonhazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or cryogenics and all pyrotechnic systems explosive bolts were disabled11 at 100 pm est 1800 gmt on january 27 first grissom then chaffee and white entered the command module fully pressuresuited and were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecrafts oxygen and communication systems grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to sour buttermilk and the simulated countdown was put on hold at 120 pm while air samples were taken no cause of the odor could be found and the countdown was resumed at 242 pm the accident investigation found this odor not to be related to the fire11 three minutes after the count was resumed the hatch installation was started the hatch consisted of three parts a removable inner hatch which stayed inside the cabin a hinged outer hatch which was part of the spacecrafts heat shield and an outer hatch cover which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire command module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch and from launch escape rocket exhaust in the event of a launch abort the boost hatch cover was partially but not fully latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power the spacecrafts fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test after the hatches were sealed the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at 167 psi 115 kpa 2 psi 14 kpa higher than atmospheric pressure1117 181 enclosure v21 movement by the astronauts was detected by the spacecrafts inertial measurement unit and the astronauts biomedical sensors and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow and sounds from grissoms stuckopen microphone the stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew the operations and checkout building and the complex 34 blockhouse control room the poor communications led grissom to remark how are we going to get to the moon if we cant talk between two or three buildings the simulated countdown was put on hold again at 540 pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem all countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 620 pm and at 630 the count remained on hold at t minus 10 minutes11 the crew members were using the time to run through their checklist again when a momentary increase in ac bus 2 voltage occurred nine seconds later at 631047 one of the astronauts some listeners and laboratory analysis indicate grissom exclaimed hey fire17 58 or flame23 this was followed by two seconds of scuffling sounds through grissoms open microphone this was immediately followed at 631062 2331062 gmt by someone believed by most listeners and supported by laboratory analysis to be chaffee saying ive or weve got a fire in the cockpit after 68 seconds of silence a second badly garbled transmission was heard by various listeners who believed this transmission was made by chaffee17 59 as the transmission lasted 50 seconds and ended with a cry of pain17 58 59 some blockhouse witnesses said that they saw white on the television monitors reaching for the inner hatch release handle11 as flames in the cabin spread from left to right17 53 the heat of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to 29 psi 200 kpa which ruptured the command modules inner wall at 63119 233119 gmt initial phase of the fire flames and gases then rushed outside the command module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure the intense heat dense smoke and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than smoke hampered the ground crews attempts to rescue the men there were fears the command module had exploded or soon would and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the command module which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel and possibly have destroyed the pad11 as the pressure was released by the cabin rupture the rush of gases within the module caused flames to spread across the cabin beginning the second phase the third phase began when most of the oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air essentially quenching the fire but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled1117 53 54 it took five minutes for the pad workers to open all three hatch layers and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended so they pushed it out of the way to one side although the cabin lights remained on they were unable to see the astronauts through the dense smoke as the smoke cleared they found the bodies but were not able to remove them the fire had partly melted grissoms and whites nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft whites restraints were burned through and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch it was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure but was not able to do so against the internal pressure chaffee was found strapped into his righthand seat as procedure called for him to maintain communication until white opened the hatch because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes the bodies were only able to be removed after 75 hours from the time the incident took place due to the gases and toxins present which prevented medical personnel from entering initially11 deke slayton was possibly the first nasa official to examine the spacecrafts interior24 his testimony contradicted the official report concerning the position of grissoms body slayton said of grissom and whites bodies it is very difficult for me to determine the exact relationships of these two bodies they were sort of jumbled together and i couldnt really tell which head even belonged to which body at that point i guess the only thing that was real obvious is that both bodies were at the lower edge of the hatch they were not in the seats they were almost completely clear of the seat areas2425 as a result of the inflight failure of the gemini 8 mission on march 17 1966 nasa deputy administrator robert seamans wrote and implemented management instruction 86211 on april 14 1966 defining mission failure investigation policy and procedures this modified nasas existing accident procedures based on military aircraft accident investigation by giving the deputy administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures beyond those for which the various program office officials were normally responsible it declared it is nasa policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations26 immediately after the fire nasa administrator james e webb asked president lyndon b johnson to allow nasa to handle the investigation according to its established procedure promising to be truthful in assessing blame and to keep the appropriate leaders of congress informed27 deputy director seamans then ordered the establishment of the apollo 204 review board chaired by langley research center director floyd l thompson which included astronaut frank borman spacecraft designer maxime faget and six others on february 1 cornell university professor frank a long left the board28 and was replaced by robert w van dolah of the us bureau of mines29 the next day north americans chief engineer for apollo george jeffs resigned as well30 seamans ordered all apollo 1 hardware and software impounded to be released only under control of the board after thorough stereo photographic documentation of the cm012 interior the board ordered its disassembly using procedures tested by disassembling the identical cm014 and conducted a thorough investigation of every part the board also reviewed the astronauts autopsy results and interviewed witnesses seamans sent webb weekly status reports of the investigations progress and the board issued its final report on april 5 196717 the autopsy report determined that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide asphyxiation occurred after the fire melted the astronauts suits and oxygen tubes exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin17 61 according to the board grissom suffered severe thirddegree burns on more than onethird of his body and his spacesuit was almost completely destroyed white suffered thirddegree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away chaffee suffered thirddegree burns on almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem the review board identified several major factors which combined to cause the fire and the astronauts deaths11 the review board determined that the electrical power momentarily failed at 233055 gmt and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment they were unable to conclusively identify a single ignition source they determined that the fire most likely started near the floor in the lower left section of the cabin close to the environmental control unit17 61 it spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right with the floor being affected only briefly17 53 the board noted that a silverplated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the center couch had become stripped of its teflon insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access doora this weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an ethylene glycolwater cooling line that had been prone to leaks electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode of the wire was discovered at the manned spacecraft center on may 29 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent exothermic reaction igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the command modules pure oxygen atmosphere experiments at the illinois institute of technology confirmed the hazard existed for silverplated wires but not for copperonly or nickelplated copper in july aspo directed both north american and grumman to ensure no silver or silvercoated electrical contacts existed in the vicinity of possible glycol spills in the apollo spacecraft33 the plugsout test had been run to simulate the launch procedure with the cabin pressurized with pure oxygen at the nominal launch level of 167 psi 115 kpa 2 psi 14 kpa above standard sea level atmospheric pressure this is more than five times the 3 psi 21 kpa partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere and provides an environment in which materials not normally considered flammable will be highly flammable and burst into flame3435 the highpressure oxygen atmosphere was similar to that which had been used successfully in the mercury and gemini programs the pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogencontaining air and replace it with pure oxygen and also to seal the plug door hatch cover during the launch the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the inflight level of 5 psi 34 kpa providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk the apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the operations and checkout building altitude vacuum chamber on october 18 and 19 1966 and the backup crew of schirra eisele and cunningham had repeated it on december 3036 the investigation board noted that during these tests the command module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes two and a half hours longer than it had been during the plugsout test17 42 b the review board cited many types and classes of combustible material close to ignition sources the nasa crew systems department had installed 34 square feet 32 m2 of velcro throughout the spacecraft almost like carpeting this velcro was found to be flammable in a highpressure 100 oxygen environment35 astronaut buzz aldrin states in his book men from earth that the flammable material had been removed per the crews august 19 complaints and joseph sheas order but was replaced before the august 26 delivery to cape kennedy37 the inner hatch cover used a plug door design sealed by higher pressure inside the cabin than outside the normal pressure level used for launch 2 psi 14 kpa above ambient created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented emergency procedure called for grissom to open the cabin vent valve first allowing white to remove the cover11 but grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left behind the initial wall of flames also while the system could easily vent the normal pressure its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to 29 psi 200 kpa caused by the intense heat of the fire17 53 north american had originally suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts to blow the hatch in case of emergency as had been done in project mercury nasa did not agree arguing the hatch could accidentally open as it had on grissoms liberty bell 7 flight so the manned spacecraft center designers rejected the explosive design in favor of a mechanically operated one for the gemini and apollo programs38 before the fire the apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outwardopening hatch and this was already slated for inclusion in the block ii command module design according to donald k slaytons testimony before the house investigation of the accident this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks and at the end of flight rather than for emergency exit31 the board noted that the test planners had failed to identify the test as hazardous emergency equipment such as gas masks were inadequate to handle this type of fire that fire rescue and medical teams were not in attendance and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps sliding doors and sharp turns17 61 62 when designing the mercury spacecraft nasa had considered using a nitrogenoxygen mixture to reduce the fire risk near launch but rejected it based on a number of considerations first a pure oxygen atmosphere is comfortably breathable by humans at 5 psi 34 kpa greatly reducing the pressure load on the spacecraft in the vacuum of space second nitrogen used with the inflight pressure reduction carried the risk of decompression sickness known as the bends but the decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was criticized when a serious accident occurred on april 21 1960 in which mcdonnell aircraft test pilot g b north passed out and was seriously injured when testing a mercury cabin spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber the problem was found to be nitrogenrich oxygenpoor air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed39 north american aviation had suggested using an oxygennitrogen mixture for apollo but nasa overruled this the pure oxygen design was judged to be safer less complicated and lighter in weight40 in his monograph project apollo the tough decisions deputy administrator seamans wrote that nasas worst mistake in engineering judgment was not running a fire test on the command module before the plugsout test41 in the first episode of the 2009 bbc documentary series nasa triumph and tragedy jim mcdivitt said that nasa had no idea how a 100 oxygen atmosphere would influence burning42 similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film in the shadow of the moon43 several fires in highoxygen test environments had occurred before the apollo fire in 1962 usaf colonel b dean smith was conducting a test of the gemini space suit with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at brooks air force base in san antonio texas when a fire broke out destroying the chamber smith and his partner narrowly escaped44 on november 17 1962 a fire broke out in a chamber at the navys air crew equipment laboratory during a pure oxygen test the fire was started because a faulty ground wire arced onto nearby insulation after attempts to extinguish the fire by smothering it the crew escaped the chamber with minor burns across large parts of their bodies45 on february 16 1965 united states navy divers fred jackson and john youmans were killed in a decompression chamber fire at the experimental diving unit in washington dc shortly after additional oxygen was added to the chambers atmospheric mix4647 in addition to fires with personnel present the apollo environmental control system experienced several accidents from 1964 to 1966 due to various hardware malfunctions notable is the april 28 1966 fire as the subsequent investigation found that several new measures should be taken to avoid fires including improved selection of materials and that esc and command module circuits have a potential for arcing or short circuits48 other oxygen fire occurrences are documented in reports archived in the national air and space museum49 such as incidents had also occurred in the soviet space program but due to the soviet governments policy of secrecy these were not disclosed until well after the apollo 1 fire cosmonaut valentin bondarenko died on march 23 1961 from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15day endurance experiment in a highoxygen isolation chamber less than three weeks before the first vostok crewed space flight this was disclosed on january 28 1986505152 during the voskhod 2 mission in march 1965 cosmonauts pavel belyayev and alexei leonov could not completely seal the spacecraft hatch after leonovs historic first walk in space the spacecrafts environmental control system responded to the leaking air by adding more oxygen to the cabin causing the concentration level to rise as high as 45 the crew and ground controllers worried about the possibility of fire remembering bondarenkos death four years earlier50 457 on january 31 1967 four days after the apollo 1 fire united states air force airmen william f bartley jr and richard g harmon were killed in a flash fire while tending laboratory rabbits in the two man space environment simulator a pure oxygen chamber at the school of aerospace medicine at brooks air force base5354555657 like the apollo 1 fire the school fire was caused by an electrical spark in a pure oxygen environment the widows of the apollo 1 crew sent condolence letters to bartley and harmons families57 committees in both houses of the united states congress with oversight of the space program soon launched investigations including the senate committee on aeronautical and space sciences chaired by senator clinton p anderson seamans webb manned space flight administrator dr george e mueller and apollo program director maj gen samuel c phillips were called to testify before andersons committee58 in the february 27 hearing senator walter f mondale asked webb if he knew of a report of extraordinary problems with the performance of north american aviation on the apollo contract webb replied he did not and deferred to his subordinates on the witness panel mueller and phillips responded they too were unaware of any such report40 however in late 1965 just over a year before the accident phillips had headed a tiger team investigating the causes of inadequate quality schedule delays and cost overruns in both the apollo csm and the saturn v second stage for which north american was also prime contractor he gave an oral presentation with transparencies of his teams findings to mueller and seamans and also presented them in a memo to north american president john l atwood to which mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to atwood59 during mondales 1967 questioning about what was to become known as the phillips report seamans was afraid mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of phillips presentation and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to onsite progress reviews perhaps this was what mondales information referred to41 mondale continued to refer to the report despite phillips refusal to characterize it as such and angered by what he perceived as webbs deception and concealment of important program problems from congress he questioned nasas selection of north american as prime contractor seamans later wrote that webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of phillips memo41 on may 11 webb issued a statement defending nasas november 1961 selection of north american as the prime contractor for apollo this was followed on june 9 by seamans filing a sevenpage memorandum documenting the selection process webb eventually provided a controlled copy of phillips memo to congress the senate committee noted in its final report nasas testimony that the findings of the phillips task force had no effect on the accident did not lead to the accident and were not related to the accident58 7 but stated in its recommendations notwithstanding that in nasas judgment the contractor later made significant progress in overcoming the problems the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation the committee does not object to the position of the administrator of nasa that all details of governmentcontractor relationships should not be put in the public domain however that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations to the attention of the committee58 11 freshman senators edward w brooke iii and charles h percy jointly wrote an additional views section appended to the committee report chastising nasa more strongly than anderson for not having disclosed the phillips review to congress mondale wrote his own even more strongly worded additional view accusing nasa of evasiveness lack of candor patronizing attitude toward congress refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries and solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy58 16 the potential political threat to apollo blew over due in large part to the support of president lyndon b johnson who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the congress from his own senatorial experience he was a staunch supporter of nasa since its inception had even recommended the moon program to president john f kennedy in 1961 and was skilled at portraying it as part of kennedys legacy relations between nasa and north american deteriorated over the assignment of blame north american argued unsuccessfully it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design finally webb contacted atwood and demanded either he or chief engineer harrison a storms resign atwood elected to fire storms60 on the nasa side joseph shea resorted to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope16 213214 nasa administrator james webb became increasingly worried about sheas mental state shea was asked to take an extended voluntary leave of absence but shea refused threatening to resign rather than take leave as a compromise he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness this approach to remove shea from his position was also unsuccessful16 217219 finally six months after the fire sheas superiors reassigned him to nasa headquarters in washington dc shea felt that his new post was a nonjob and left after only two months61 from this day forward flight control will be known by two words tough and competent tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do we will never again compromise our responsibilities competent means we will never take anything for granted mission control will be perfect when you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write tough and competent on your blackboards it will never be erased each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by grissom white and chaffee these words are the price of admission to the ranks of mission control gene kranz called a meeting of his staff in mission control three days after the accident delivering a speech which has subsequently become one of nasas principles62 speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the apollo program before the accident he said we were too gungho about the schedule and we blocked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work every element of the program was in trouble and so were we63 204 he reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be tough and competent requiring nothing less than perfection throughout nasas programs63 204 in 2003 following the space shuttle columbia disaster nasa administrator sean okeefe quoted kranzs speech applying it to the columbia crew62 after the fire the apollo program was grounded for review and redesign the command module was found to be extremely hazardous and in some instances carelessly assembled for example a misplaced wrench socket was found in the cabin17 510 it was decided that the remaining block i spacecraft would be used only for uncrewed saturn v test flights all crewed missions would use the block ii spacecraft to which many command module design changes were made thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance the astronauts widows asked that apollo 1 be reserved for the flight their husbands never made and on april 24 1967 mueller as associate administrator for manned space flight announced this change officially as204 would be recorded as apollo 1 first manned apollo saturn flight failed on ground test1 even though three uncrewed apollo missions as201 as202 and as203 had previously occurred only as201 and as202 carried spacecraft therefore the next mission the first uncrewed saturn v test flight as501 would be designated apollo 4 with all subsequent flights numbered sequentially in the order flown the first three flights would not be renumbered and the names apollo 2 and apollo 3 would officially go unused65 mueller considered as201 and as202 the first and second flights of the apollo block i csm as apollo 2 and 3 respectively66 the crewed flight hiatus allowed work to catch up on the saturn v and lunar module which were encountering their own delays apollo 4 flew in november 1967 apollo 1s as204 saturn ib rocket was taken down from launch complex 34 later reassembled at launch complex 37b and used to launch apollo 5 an uncrewed earth orbital test flight of the first lunar module lm1 in january 196867 a second uncrewed saturn v as502 flew as apollo 6 in april 1968 and grissoms backup crew of wally schirra don eisele and walter cunningham finally flew the orbital test mission as apollo 7 as205 in a block ii csm in october 196868 gus grissom and roger chaffee were buried at arlington national cemetery ed white was buried at west point cemetery on the grounds of the united states military academy in west point new york nasa officials attempted to pressure pat white ed whites widow into allowing her husband also to be buried at arlington against what she knew to be his wishes their efforts were foiled by astronaut frank
