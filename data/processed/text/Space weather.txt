space weather is a branch of space physics and aeronomy or heliophysics concerned with the varying conditions within the solar system and its heliosphere this includes the effects of the solar wind especially on the earths magnetosphere ionosphere thermosphere and exosphere1 though physically distinct space weather is analogous to the terrestrial weather of earths atmosphere troposphere and stratosphere the term space weather was first used in the 1950s and popularized in the 1990s2 later it prompted research into space climate the largescale and longterm patterns of space weather for many centuries the effects of space weather were noticed but not understood displays of auroral light have long been observed at high latitudes in 1724 george graham reported that the needle of a magnetic compass was regularly deflected from magnetic north over the course of each day this effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by balfour stewart in 1882 and confirmed by arthur schuster in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data in 1852 astronomer and british major general edward sabine showed that the probability of the occurrence of geomagnetic storms on earth was correlated with the number of sunspots demonstrating a novel solarterrestrial interaction the solar storm of 1859 caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global telegraph operations richard carrington correctly connected the storm with a solar flare that he had observed the day before near a large sunspot group demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the earth kristian birkeland explained the physics of aurorae by creating artificial ones in his laboratory and predicted the solar wind the introduction of radio revealed that solar weather could cause extreme static or noise radar jamming during a large solar event in 1942 led to the discovery of solar radio bursts radio waves over a broad frequency range created by a solar flare in the 20th century the interest in space weather expanded as military and commercial systems came to depend on systems affected by space weather communications satellites are a vital part of global commerce weather satellite systems provide information about terrestrial weather the signals from satellites of a global positioning system gps are used in a wide variety of applications space weather phenomena can interfere with or damage these satellites or interfere with the radio signals with which they operate space weather phenomena can cause damaging surges in longdistance transmission lines and expose passengers and crew of aircraft travel to radiation34 especially on polar routes the international geophysical year increased research into space weather groundbased data obtained during igy demonstrated that the aurorae occurred in an auroral oval a permanent region of luminescence 15 to 25 in latitude from the magnetic poles and 5 to 20 wide5 in 1958 the explorer i satellite discovered the van allen belts6 regions of radiation particles trapped by the earths magnetic field in january 1959 the soviet satellite luna 1 first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength a smaller international heliophysical year ihy occurred in 20072008 in 1969 injun5 or explorer 407 made the first direct observation of the electric field impressed on the earths highlatitude ionosphere by the solar wind8 in the early 1970s triad data demonstrated that permanent electric currents flowed between the auroral oval and the magnetosphere9 the term space weather came into usage in the late 1950s as the space age began and satellites began to measure the space environment2 the term regained popularity in the 1990s along with the belief that spaces impact on human systems demanded a more coordinated research and application framework10 the purpose of the us national space weather program is to focus research on the needs of the affected commercial and military communities to connect the research and user communities to create coordination between operational data centers and to better define user community needs noaa operates the national weather services space weather prediction center11 the concept was turned into an action plan in 200012 an implementation plan in 2002 an assessment in 200613 and a revised strategic plan in 201014 a revised action plan was scheduled to be released in 2011 followed by a revised implementation plan in 2012 international civil aviation organization icao implemented a space weather advisory program in late 2019 under this program icao designated four global space weather service providers15 within the solar system space weather is influenced by the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field carried by the solar wind plasma a variety of physical phenomena is associated with space weather including geomagnetic storms and substorms energization of the van allen radiation belts ionospheric disturbances and scintillation of satellitetoground radio signals and longrange radar signals aurorae and geomagnetically induced currents at earths surface coronal mass ejections are also important drivers of space weather as they can compress the magnetosphere and trigger geomagnetic storms solar energetic particles sep accelerated by coronal mass ejections or solar flares can trigger solar particle events a critical driver of human impact space weather as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft eg galaxy 15 failure and threaten the lives of astronauts as well as increase radiation hazards to highaltitude highlatitude aviation some spacecraft failures can be directly attributed to space weather many more are thought to have a space weather component for example 46 of the 70 failures reported in 2003 occurred during the october 2003 geomagnetic storm the two most common adverse space weather effects on spacecraft are radiation damage and spacecraft charging radiation highenergy particles passes through the skin of the spacecraft and into the electronic components in most cases the radiation causes an erroneous signal or changes one bit in memory of a spacecrafts electronics single event upsets in a few cases the radiation destroys a section of the electronics singleevent latchup spacecraft charging is the accumulation of an electrostatic charge on a nonconducting material on the spacecrafts surface by lowenergy particles if enough charge is built up a discharge spark occurs this can cause an erroneous signal to be detected and acted on by the spacecraft computer a recent study indicated that spacecraft charging is the predominant space weather effect on spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit17 the orbits of spacecraft in low earth orbit leo decay to lower and lower altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecrafts surface ie drag and the outer layer of the earths atmosphere or the thermosphere and exosphere eventually a leo spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the earths surface many spacecraft launched in the past few decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits the rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime to direct the reentry towards a particular marine site or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit a geomagnetic storm can cause an orbit change over a few days that otherwise would occur over a year or more the geomagnetic storm adds heat to the thermosphere causing the thermosphere to expand and rise increasing the drag on spacecraft the 2009 satellite collision between the iridium 33 and cosmos 2251 demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit iridium 33 had the capability to maneuver out of the path of cosmos 2251 and could have evaded the crash if a credible collision prediction had been available the exposure of a human body to ionizing radiation has the same harmful effects whether the source of the radiation is a medical xray machine a nuclear power plant or radiation in space the degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiations energy density the everpresent radiation belts extend down to the altitude of crewed spacecraft such as the international space station iss and the space shuttle but the amount of exposure is within the acceptable lifetime exposure limit under normal conditions during a major space weather event that includes an sep burst the flux can increase by orders of magnitude areas within iss provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits18 for the space shuttle such an event would have required immediate mission termination the ionosphere bends radio waves in the same manner that water in a pool bends visible light when the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable the degree of distortion scintillation of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency radio signals in the vhf band 30 to 300 mhz can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere radio signals in the uhf band 300 mhz to 3 ghz transit a disturbed ionosphere but a receiver may not be able to keep locked to the carrier frequency gps uses signals at 157542 mhz l1 and 12276 mhz l2 that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere space weather events that corrupt gps signals can significantly impact society for example the wide area augmentation system operated by the us federal aviation administration faa is used as a navigation tool for north american commercial aviation it is disabled by every major space weather event outages can range from minutes to days major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10 to 30 of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients changes in density over distance of hundreds of km at mid and low latitude both of these factors can distort gps signals radio waves in the hf band 3 to 30 mhz also known as the shortwave band are reflected by the ionosphere since the ground also reflects hf waves a signal can be transmitted around the curvature of the earth beyond the line of sight during the 20th century hf communications was the only method for a ship or aircraft far from land or a base station to communicate the advent of systems such as iridium brought other methods of communications but hf remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter hf signals instead of reflecting them preventing hf communications at auroral and polar latitudes small space weather events that occur frequently disrupt hf communications at midlatitudes hf communications are disrupted by solar radio bursts by xrays from solar flares which enhance and disturb the ionospheric dlayer and by tec enhancements and irregularities during major geomagnetic storms transpolar airline routes are particularly sensitive to space weather in part because federal aviation regulations require reliable communication over the entire flight19 diverting such a flight is estimated to cost about 10000020 the magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and solar energetic particles to polar latitudes while highenergy charged particles enter the mesosphere stratosphere and troposphere these energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules creating harmful lowerenergy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation all aircraft flying above 8 km 26200 feet altitude are exposed to these particles the dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at midlatitude and equatorial regions many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region when a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities21 the aircrafts flight path is diverted measurements of the radiation environment at commercial aircraft altitudes above 8 km 26000 ft have historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground however a system of realtime radiation measurements onboard aircraft has been developed through the nasa automated radiation measurements for aerospace safety armas program22 armas has flown hundreds of flights since 2013 mostly on research aircraft and sent the data to the ground through iridium satellite links the eventual goal of these types of measurements is to data assimilate them into physicsbased global radiation models eg nasas nowcast of atmospheric ionizing radiation system nairas so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology magnetic storm activity can induce geoelectric fields in the earths conducting lithosphere23 corresponding voltage differentials can find their way into electric power grids through ground connections driving uncontrolled electric currents that interfere with grid operation damage transformers trip protective relays and sometimes cause blackouts24 this complicated chain of causes and effects was demonstrated during the magnetic storm of march 198925 which caused the complete collapse of the hydroqubec electricpower grid in canada temporarily leaving nine million people without electricity the possible occurrence of an even more intense storm26 led to operational standards intended to mitigate inductionhazard risks while reinsurance companies commissioned revised risk assessments27 air and shipborne magnetic surveys can be affected by rapid magnetic field variations during geomagnetic storms such storms cause datainterpretation problems because the space weatherrelated magnetic field changes are similar in magnitude to those of the subsurface crustal magnetic field in the survey area accurate geomagnetic storm warnings including an assessment of storm magnitude and duration allows for an economic use of survey equipment for economic and other reasons oil and gas production often involves horizontal drilling of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead accuracy requirements are strict due to target size reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across and safety because of the proximity of other boreholes the most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive since it can stop drilling for hours an alternative is to use a magnetic survey which enables measurement while drilling mwd near realtime magnetic data can be used to correct drilling direction2829 magnetic data and space weather forecasts can help to clarify unknown sources of drilling error the amount of energy entering the troposphere and stratosphere from space weather phenomena is trivial compared to the solar insolation in the visible and infrared portions of the solar electromagnetic spectrum although some linkage between the 11year sunspot cycle and the earths climate has been claimed30 this has never been verified for example the maunder minimum a 70year period almost devoid of sunspots has often been suggested to be correlated to a cooler climate but these correlations have disappeared after deeper studies the suggested link from changes in cosmicray flux causing changes in the amount of cloud formation31 did not survive scientific tests another suggestion that variations in the extreme ultraviolet euv flux subtly influence existing drivers of the climate and tip the balance between el niola nia events32 collapsed when new research showed this was not possible as such a linkage between space weather and the climate has not been demonstrated in addition a link has been suggested between high energy charged particles such as seps and cosmic rays and cloud formation this is because charged particles interact with the atmosphere to produce volatiles which then condense creating cloud seeds33 this is a topic of ongoing research at cern where experiments test the effect of highenergy charged particles on atmosphere34 if proven this may suggest a link between space weather in the form of solar particle events and cloud formation35 most recently a statistical connection has been reported between the occurrence of heavy floods and the arrivals of highspeed solar wind streams hsss the enhanced auroral energy deposition during hsss is suggested as a mechanism for the generation of downward propagating atmospheric gravity waves agws as agws reach lower atmosphere they may excite the conditional instability in the troposphere thus leading to excessive rainfall 36 observation of space weather is done both for scientific research and applications scientific observation has evolved with the state of knowledge while applicationrelated observation expanded with the ability to exploit such data space weather is monitored at ground level by observing changes in the earths magnetic field over periods of seconds to days by observing the surface of the sun and by observing radio noise created in the suns atmosphere the sunspot number ssn is the number of sunspots on the suns photosphere in visible light on the side of the sun visible to an earth observer the number and total area of sunspots are related to the brightness of the sun in the euv and xray portions of the solar spectrum and to solar activity such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections the 107 cm radio flux f107 is a measurement of rf emissions from the sun and is roughly correlated with the solar euv flux since this rf emission is easily obtained from the ground and euv flux is not this value has been measured and disseminated continuously since 1947 the world standard measurements are made by the dominion radio astrophysical observatory at penticton bc canada and reported once a day at local noon37 in solar flux units 1022wm2hz1 f107 is archived by the national geophysical data center38 fundamental space weather monitoring data are provided by groundbased magnetometers and magnetic observatories magnetic storms were first discovered by groundbased measurement of occasional magnetic disturbance ground magnetometer data provide realtime situational awareness for postevent analysis magnetic observatories have been in continuous operations for decades to centuries providing data to inform studies of longterm changes in space climatology3940 disturbance storm time index dst index is an estimate of the magnetic field change at the earths magnetic equator due to a ring of electric current at and just earthward of the geosynchronous orbit41 the index is based on data from four groundbased magnetic observatories between 21 and 33 magnetic latitude during a onehour period stations closer to the magnetic equator are not used due to ionospheric effects the dst index is compiled and archived by the world data center for geomagnetism kyoto42 kpap index a is an index created from the geomagnetic disturbance at one midlatitude 40 to 50 latitude geomagnetic observatory during a 3hour period k is the quasilogarithmic counterpart of the a index kp and ap are the average of k and an over 13 geomagnetic observatories to represent planetarywide geomagnetic disturbances the kpap index43 indicates both geomagnetic storms and substorms auroral disturbance kpap data are available from 1932 onward ae index is compiled from geomagnetic disturbances at 12 geomagnetic observatories in and near the auroral zones and is recorded at 1minute intervals42 the public ae index is available with a lag of two to three days that limits its utility for space weather applications the ae index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic substorms except during a major geomagnetic storm when the auroral zones expand equatorward from the observatories radio noise bursts are reported by the radio solar telescope network to the us air force and to noaa the radio bursts are associated with solar flare plasma that interacts with the ambient solar atmosphere the suns photosphere is observed continuously44 for activity that can be the precursors to solar flares and cmes the global oscillation network group gong45 project monitors both the surface and the interior of the sun by using helioseismology the study of sound waves propagating through the sun and observed as ripples on the solar surface gong can detect sunspot groups on the far side of the sun this ability has recently been verified by visual observations from the stereo spacecraft neutron monitors on the ground indirectly monitor cosmic rays from the sun and galactic sources when cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere atomic interactions occur that cause a shower of lowerenergy particles to descend into the atmosphere and to ground level the presence of cosmic rays in the nearearth space environment can be detected by monitoring highenergy neutrons at ground level small fluxes of cosmic rays are present continuously large fluxes are produced by the sun during events related to energetic solar flares total electron content tec is a measure of the ionosphere over a given location tec is the number of electrons in a column one meter square from the base of the ionosphere around 90 km altitude to the top of the ionosphere around 1000 km altitude many tec measurements are made by monitoring the two frequencies transmitted by gps spacecraft presently gps tec is monitored and distributed in real time from more than 360 stations maintained by agencies in many countries geoeffectiveness is a measure of how strongly space weather magnetic fields such as coronal mass ejections couple with the earths magnetic field this is determined by the direction of the magnetic field held within the plasma that originates from the sun new techniques measuring faraday rotation in radio waves are in development to measure field direction4647 a host of research spacecraft have explored space weather48495051 the orbiting geophysical observatory series were among the first spacecraft with the mission of analyzing the space environment recent spacecraft include the nasaesa solarterrestrial relations observatory stereo pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 into solar orbit and the van allen probes launched in 2012 into a highly elliptical earth orbit the two stereo spacecraft drift away from the earth by about 22 per year one leading and the other trailing the earth in its orbit together they compile information about the solar surface and atmosphere in three dimensions the van allen probes record detailed information about the radiation belts geomagnetic storms and the relationship between the two some spacecraft with other primary missions have carried auxiliary instruments for solar observation among the earliest such spacecraft were the applications technology satellite52 ats series at geo that were precursors to the modern geostationary operational environmental satellite goes weather satellite and many communication satellites the ats spacecraft carried environmental particle sensors as auxiliary payloads and had their navigational magnetic field sensor used for sensing the environment many of the early instruments were research spacecraft that were repurposed for space weather applications one of the first of these was the imp8 interplanetary monitoring platform53 it orbited the earth at 35 earth radii and observed the solar wind for twothirds of its 12day orbits from 1973 to 2006 since the solar wind carries disturbances that affect the magnetosphere and ionosphere imp8 demonstrated the utility of continuous solar wind monitoring imp8 was followed by isee3 which was placed near the l1 sunearth lagrangian point 235 earth radii above the surface about 15 million km or 924000 miles and continuously monitored the solar wind from 1978 to 1982 the next spacecraft to monitor the solar wind at the l1 point was wind from 1994 to 1998 after april 1998 the wind spacecraft orbit was changed to circle the earth and occasionally pass the l1 point the nasa advanced composition explorer has monitored the solar wind at the l1 point from 1997 to present in addition to monitoring the solar wind monitoring the sun is important to space weather because the solar euv cannot be monitored from the ground the joint nasaesa solar and heliospheric observatory soho spacecraft was launched and has provided solar euv images beginning in 1995 soho is a main source of nearreal time solar data for both research and space weather prediction and inspired the stereo mission the yohkoh spacecraft at leo observed the sun from 1991 to 2001 in the xray portion of the solar spectrum and was useful for both research and space weather prediction data from yohkoh inspired the solar xray imager on goes spacecraft with instruments whose primary purpose is to provide data for space weather predictions and applications include the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes series of spacecraft the poes series the dmsp series and the meteosat series the goes spacecraft have carried an xray sensor xrs which measures the flux from the whole solar disk in two bands 005 to 04 nm and 01 to 08 nm since 1974 an xray imager sxi since 2004 a magnetometer which measures the distortions of the earths magnetic field due to space weather a whole disk euv sensor since 2004 and particle sensors epshepad which measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 50 kev to 500 mev starting sometime after 2015 the goesr generation of goes spacecraft will replace the sxi with a solar euv image suvi similar to the one on soho and stereo and the particle sensor will be augmented with a component to extend the energy range down to 30 ev the deep space climate observatory dscovr satellite is a noaa earth observation and space weather satellite that launched in february 2015 among its features is advance warning of coronal mass ejections54 space weather models are simulations of the space weather environment models use sets of mathematical equations to describe physical processes these models take a limited data set and attempt to describe all or part of the space weather environment in or to predict how weather evolves over time early models were heuristic ie they did not directly employ physics these models take less resources than their more sophisticated descendants later models use physics to account for as many phenomena as possible no model can yet reliably predict the environment from the surface of the sun to the bottom of the earths ionosphere space weather models differ from meteorological models in that the amount of input is vastly smaller a significant portion of space weather model research and development in the past two decades has been done as part of the geospace environmental model gem program of the national science foundation the two major modeling centers are the center for space environment modeling csem55 and the center for integrated space weather modeling cism56 the community coordinated modeling center57 ccmc at the nasa goddard space flight center is a facility for coordinating the development and testing of research models for improving and preparing models for use in space weather prediction and application58 modeling techniques include a magnetohydrodynamics in which the environment is treated as a fluid b particle in cell in which nonfluid interactions are handled within a cell and then cells are connected to describe the environment c first principles in which physical processes are in balance or equilibrium with one another d semistatic modeling in which a statistical or empirical relationship is described or a combination of multiple methods during the first decade of the 21st century a commercial sector emerged that engaged in space weather serving agency academia commercial and consumer sectors59 space weather providers are typically smaller companies or small divisions within a larger company that provide space weather data models derivative products and service distributioncitation needed the commercial sector includes scientific and engineering researchers as well as users activities are primarily directed toward the impacts of space weather upon technology these include for example many of these disturbances result in societal impacts that account for a significant part of the national gdp6263 the concept of incentivizing commercial space weather was first suggested by the idea of a space weather economic innovation zone discussed by the american commercial space weather association acswa in 2015 the establishment of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities it could encourage us business investment in space weather services and products it promoted the support of us business innovation in space weather services and products by requiring us government purchases of us built commercial hardware software and associated products and services where no suitable government capability preexists it also promoted us built commercial hardware software and associated products and services sales to international partners designate us built commercial hardware services and products as space weather economic innovation zone activities finally it recommended that us built commercial hardware services and products be tracked as space weather economic innovation zone contributions within agency reports in 2015 the us congress bill hr1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a space weather economic innovation zone could be farreaching in 2016 the space weather research and forecasting act s 2817 was introduced to build on that legacy later in 20172018 the hr3086 bill took these concepts included the breadth of material from parallel agency studies as part of the ostpsponsored space weather action program swap64 and with bicameral and bipartisan support the 116th congress 2019 is considering passage of the space weather coordination act s141 115th congresscitation needed
