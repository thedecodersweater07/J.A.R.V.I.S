coordinated universal time utc is the primary time standard globally used to regulate clocks and time it establishes a reference for the current time forming the basis for civil time and time zones utc facilitates international communication navigation scientific research and commerce utc has been widely embraced by most countries and is the effective successor to greenwich mean time gmt in everyday usage and common applicationsa in specialised domains such as scientific research navigation and timekeeping other standards such as ut1 and international atomic time tai are also used alongside utc utc is based on tai international atomic time abbreviated from its french name temps atomique international which is a weighted average of hundreds of atomic clocks worldwide utc is within about one second of mean solar time at 0 longitude the currently used prime meridian and is not adjusted for daylight saving time the coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 january 1960 utc was first officially adopted as a standard in 1963 and utc became the official abbreviation of coordinated universal time in 19672 the current version of utc is defined by the international telecommunication union since adoption utc has been adjusted several times notably adding leap seconds starting in 1972 recent years have seen significant developments in the realm of utc particularly in discussions about eliminating leap seconds from the timekeeping system because leap seconds occasionally disrupt timekeeping systems worldwide the general conference on weights and measures adopted a resolution to alter utc with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds by 20353 the official abbreviation for coordinated universal time is utc this abbreviation comes as a result of the international telecommunication union and the international astronomical union wanting to use the same abbreviation in all languages4 the compromise that emerged was utc5 which conforms to the pattern for the abbreviations of the variants of universal time ut0 ut1 ut2 ut1r etc6 mccarthy described the origin of the abbreviation in 1967 the ccir adopted the names coordinated universal time and temps universel coordonn for the english and french names with the acronym utc to be used in both languages the name coordinated universal time utc was approved by a resolution of iau commissions 4 and 31 at the 13th general assembly in 1967 trans iau 19682 time zones around the world are expressed using positive zero or negative offsets from utc as in the list of time zones by utc offset the westernmost time zone uses utc12 being twelve hours behind utc the easternmost time zone uses utc14 being fourteen hours ahead of utc in 1995 the island nation of kiribati moved those of its atolls in the line islands from utc10 to utc14 so that kiribati would all be on the same day utc is used in many internet and world wide web standards the network time protocol ntp designed to synchronise the clocks of computers over the internet transmits time information from the utc system7 if only milliseconds precision is needed clients can obtain the current utc from a number of official internet utc servers for submicrosecond precision clients can obtain the time from satellite signals utc is also the time standard used in aviation8 eg for flight plans and air traffic control in this context it is frequently referred to as zulu time as described below weather forecasts and maps all use utc to avoid confusion about time zones and daylight saving time the international space station also uses utc as a time standard amateur radio operators often schedule their radio contacts in utc because transmissions on some frequencies can be picked up in many time zones9 utc divides time into days hours minutes and seconds days are conventionally identified using the gregorian calendar but julian day numbers can also be used each day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60 minutes the number of seconds in a minute is usually 60 but with an occasional leap second it may be 61 or 59 instead10 thus in the utc time scale the second and all smaller time units millisecond microsecond etc are of constant duration but the minute and all larger time units hour day week etc are of variable duration decisions to introduce a leap second are announced at least six months in advance in bulletin c produced by the international earth rotation and reference systems service1112 the leap seconds cannot be predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of the rotation of earth13 nearly all utc days contain exactly 86400 si seconds with exactly 60 seconds in each minute utc is within about one second of mean solar time such as ut1 at 0 longitude14 at the iers reference meridian the mean solar day is slightly longer than 86400 si seconds so occasionally the last minute of a utc day is adjusted to have 61 seconds the extra second is called a leap second it accounts for the grand total of the extra length about 2 milliseconds each of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second the last minute of a utc day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the remote possibility of the earth rotating faster but that has not yet been necessary the irregular day lengths mean fractional julian days do not work properly with utc since 1972 utc may be calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from international atomic time tai which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional proper time on the rotating surface of the earth the geoid in order to maintain a close approximation to ut1 utc occasionally has discontinuities where it changes from one linear function of tai to another these discontinuities take the form of leap seconds implemented by a utc day of irregular length discontinuities in utc occurred only at the end of june or december however there is provision for them to happen at the end of march and september as a second preference as well1516 the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers tracks and publishes the difference between utc and universal time dut1 ut1 utc and introduces discontinuities into utc to keep dut1 in the interval 09 s 09 s as with tai utc is only known with the highest precision in retrospect users who require an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory which disseminates an approximation using techniques such as gps or radio time signals such approximations are designated utck where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory17 the time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations later corrections may be applied using the international bureau of weights and measures bipm monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical taiutc and taikutck as estimated in realtime by participating laboratories18 see the article on international atomic time for details because of time dilation a standard clock not on the geoid or in rapid motion will not maintain synchronicity with utc therefore telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is used to provide utc when required on locations such as those of spacecraft it is impossible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two utc timestamps without consulting a table showing how many leap seconds occurred during that interval by extension it is not possible to compute the precise duration of a time interval that ends in the future and may encompass an unknown number of leap seconds for example the number of tai seconds between now and 20991231 235959 therefore many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long multiyear intervals use tai instead tai is also commonly used by systems that cannot handle leap seconds gps time always remains exactly 19 seconds behind tai neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in utc time zones are usually defined as differing from utc by an integer number of hours19 although the laws of each jurisdiction would have to be consulted if subsecond accuracy was required several jurisdictions have established time zones that differ by an odd integer number of halfhours or quarterhours from ut1 or utc current civil time in a particular time zone can be determined by adding or subtracting the number of hours and minutes specified by the utc offset which ranges from utc1200 in the west to utc1400 in the east see list of utc offsets the time zone using utc is sometimes denoted utc0000 or by the letter za reference to the equivalent nautical time zone gmt which has been denoted by a z since about 1950 time zones were identified by successive letters of the alphabet and the greenwich time zone was marked by a z as it was the point of origin the letter also refers to the zone description of zero hours which has been used since 1920 see time zone history since the nato phonetic alphabet word for z is zulu utc is sometimes known as zulu time this is especially true in aviation where zulu is the universal standard20 this ensures that all pilots regardless of location are using the same 24hour clock thus avoiding confusion when flying between time zones21 see the list of military time zones for letters used in addition to z in qualifying time zones other than greenwich on electronic devices which only allow the time zone to be configured using maps or city names utc can be selected indirectly by selecting cities such as accra in ghana or reykjavk in iceland as they are always on utc and do not currently use daylight saving time which greenwich and london do and so could be a source of error22 utc does not change with a change of seasons but local time or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time summer time for example local time on the east coast of the united states is five hours behind utc during winter23 but four hours behind while daylight saving is observed there24 in 1928 the term universal time ut was introduced by the international astronomical union to refer to gmt with the day starting at midnight25 until the 1950s broadcast time signals were based on ut and hence on the rotation of the earth in 1955 the caesium atomic clock was invented this provided a form of timekeeping that was both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations in 1956 the us national bureau of standards and us naval observatory started to develop atomic frequency time scales by 1959 these time scales were used in generating the wwv time signals named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them in 1960 the us naval observatory the royal greenwich observatory and the uk national physical laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so that time steps and frequency changes were coordinated and the resulting time scale was informally referred to as coordinated universal time2627 in a controversial decision the frequency of the signals was initially set to match the rate of ut but then kept at the same frequency by the use of atomic clocks and deliberately allowed to drift away from ut when the divergence grew significantly the signal was phase shifted stepped by 20 ms to bring it back into agreement with ut twentynine such steps were used before 196028 in 1958 data was published linking the frequency for the caesium transition newly established with the ephemeris second the ephemeris second is a unit in the system of time that when used as the independent variable in the laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system enables the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar system bodies within the limits of observable accuracy ephemeris seconds are of constant length as are atomic seconds this publication allowed a value to be chosen for the length of the atomic second that would accord with the celestial laws of motion29 the coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 january 1960 utc was first officially adopted in 1963 as ccir recommendation 374 standardfrequency and timesignal emissions and utc became the official abbreviation of coordinated universal time in 19672 in 1961 the bureau international de lheure began coordinating the utc process internationally but the name coordinated universal time was not formally adopted by the international astronomical union until 19673031 from then on there were time steps every few months and frequency changes at the end of each year the jumps increased in size to 01 seconds this utc was intended to permit a very close approximation to ut226 in 1967 the si second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock the length of second so defined was practically equal to the second of ephemeris time32 this was the frequency that had been provisionally used in tai since 1958 it was soon decided that having two types of second with different lengths namely the utc second and the si second used in tai was a bad idea it was thought better for time signals to maintain a consistent frequency and that this frequency should match the si second thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the approximation of ut this was tried experimentally in a service known as stepped atomic time sat which ticked at the same rate as tai and used jumps of 02 seconds to stay synchronised with ut233 there was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in utc and sat in 1968 louis essen the inventor of the caesium atomic clock and g m r winkler both independently proposed that steps should be of 1 second only34 to simplify future adjustments this system was eventually approved as leap seconds in a new utc in 1970 and implemented in 1972 along with the idea of maintaining the utc second equal to the tai second this ccir recommendation 460 stated that a carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the si second b step adjustments when necessary should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with universal time ut and c standard signals should contain information on the difference between utc and ut35 as an intermediate step at the end of 1971 there was a final irregular jump of exactly 0107758 tai seconds making the total of all the small time steps and frequency shifts in utc or tai during 19581971 exactly ten seconds so that 1 january 1972 000000 utc was 1 january 1972 000010 tai exactly36 and a whole number of seconds thereafter at the same time the tick rate of utc was changed to exactly match tai utc also started to track ut1 rather than ut2 some time signals started to broadcast the dut1 correction ut1 utc for applications requiring a closer approximation of ut1 than utc now provided3738 the current version of utc is defined by international telecommunication union recommendation itur tf4606 standardfrequency and timesignal emissions39 and is based on international atomic time tai with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the accumulated difference between tai and time measured by earths rotation40 leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep utc within 09 seconds of the ut1 variant of universal time41 see the current number of leap seconds section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date the first leap second occurred on 30 june 1972 since then leap seconds have occurred on average about once every 19 months always on 30 june or 31 december as of july 2022update there have been 27 leap seconds in total all positive putting utc 37 seconds behind tai42 a study published in march 2024 in nature concluded that accelerated melting of ice in greenland and antarctica due to climate change has decreased earths rotational velocity affecting utc adjustments and causing problems for computer networks that rely on utc43 earths rotational speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration this increases the length of the mean solar day the length of the si second was calibrated on the basis of the second of ephemeris time2932 and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892 analysed by simon newcomb as a result the si second is close to 186400 of a mean solar day in the mid19th century44 in earlier centuries the mean solar day was shorter than 86400 si seconds and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86400 seconds near the end of the 20th century the length of the mean solar day also known simply as length of day or lod was approximately 864000013 s45 for this reason ut is now slower than tai by the difference or excess lod of 13 msday the excess of the lod over the nominal 86400 s accumulates over time causing the utc day initially synchronised with the mean sun to become desynchronised and run ahead of it near the end of the 20th century with the lod at 13 ms above the nominal value utc ran faster than ut by 13 ms per day getting a second ahead roughly every 800 days thus leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval retarding utc to keep it synchronised in the long term46 the actual rotational period varies on unpredictable factors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed rather than computed just as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the year is getting longer by one day every four years the insertion of a leap second every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a second every 800 days it will take about 50000 years for a mean solar day to lengthen by one second at a rate of 2 ms per century this rate fluctuates within the range of 1723 mscy while the rate due to tidal friction alone is about 23 mscy the uplift of canada and scandinavia by several metres since the last ice age has temporarily reduced this to 17 mscy over the last 2700 years47 the correct reason for leap seconds then is not the current difference between actual and nominal lod but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period of time near the end of the 20th century this difference was about 1800 of a second per day therefore after about 800 days it accumulated to 1 second and a leap second was then added in the graph of dut1 above the excess of lod above the nominal 86400 s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical segments the slope became shallower in the 1980s 2000s and late 2010s to 2020s because of slight accelerations of earths rotation temporarily shortening the day vertical position on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time and the vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated difference leap seconds are timed to keep dut1 within the vertical range depicted by the adjacent graph the frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope of the diagonal graph segments and thus to the excess lod time periods when the slope reverses direction slopes upwards not the vertical segments are times when the excess lod is negative that is when the lod is below 86400 s as the earths rotation continues to slow positive leap seconds will be required more frequently the longterm rate of change of lod is approximately 17 ms per century at the end of the 21st century lod will be roughly 86400004 s requiring leap seconds every 250 days over several centuries the frequency of leap seconds will become problematic48 a change in the trend of the ut1 utc values was seen beginning around june 2019 in which instead of slowing down with leap seconds to keep the difference between ut1 and utc less than 09 seconds the earths rotation has sped up causing this difference to increase if the trend continues a negative leap second may be required which has not been used before this may not be needed until 20254950 some time in the 22nd century two leap seconds will be required every year the current practice of only allowing leap seconds in june and december will be insufficient to maintain a difference of less than 1 second and it might be decided to introduce leap seconds in march and september in the 25th century four leap seconds are projected to be required every year so the current quarterly options would be insufficient in april 2001 rob seaman of the national optical astronomy observatory proposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice yearly51 in 2022 a resolution was adopted by the general conference on weights and measures to redefine utc and abolish leap seconds but keep the civil second constant and equal to the si second so that sundials would slowly get further and further out of sync with civil time the leap seconds will be eliminated by 2035 the resolution does not break the connection between utc and ut1 but increases the maximum allowable difference the details of what the maximum difference will be and how corrections will be implemented is left for future discussions3 this will result in a shift of the suns movements relative to civil time with the difference increasing quadratically with time ie proportional to elapsed centuries squared this is analogous to the shift of seasons relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the tropical year length this would be a change in civil timekeeping and would have a slow effect at first but becoming drastic over several centuries utc and tai would be more and more ahead of ut it would coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting eastward faster and faster52 thus the time system will lose its fixed connection to the geographic coordinates based on the iers meridian the difference between utc and ut would reach 05 hours after the year 2600 and 65 hours around 460053 itur study group 7 and working party 7a were unable to reach consensus on whether to advance the proposal to the 2012 radiocommunications assembly the chairman of study group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012 radiocommunications assembly 20 january 201254 but consideration of the proposal was postponed by the itu until the world radio conference in 201555 this conference in turn considered the question56 but no permanent decision was reached it only chose to engage in further study with the goal of reconsideration in 202357needs update a proposed alternative to the leap second is the leap hour or leap minute which requires changes only once every few centuries58 itu world radiocommunication conference 2023 wrc23 which was held in dubai united arab emirates from 20 november to 15 december 2023 formally recognised resolution 459 of the 27th cgpm 2022 which decides that the maximum value for the difference ut1utc will be increased in or before 203560
