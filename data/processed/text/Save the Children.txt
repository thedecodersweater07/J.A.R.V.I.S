war i which continued after the armistice3 at the end of world war i images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout europe the fight the famine council was initially started earlier in 1919 to put political pressure on the british government to end the blockade the first meeting having been held at the home of catherine courtney at 15 cheyne walk on 15 april 1919 the sisters separated from the council and created the save the children fund3 in may 1919 the fund was publicly established at a meeting in londons royal albert hall to provide relief to children suffering the effects of war and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from wartime shortages of food and supplies45 jebb and her sister buxton worked to gain exposure to elicit aid6 in december 1919 pope

save the children union in geneva on 6 january 1920 jebb built relationships with other genevabased organizations including the international committee of the red cross who supported saves international foundation3 jebb used fundraising techniques to gain exposure for example making save the children the first charity in the united kingdom to use pagelength advertisements in newspapers jebb contracted doctors lawyers and other professionals to devise mass advertisement campaigns in 1920 save the children started individual child sponsorship to engage more donors by the end of the year save the children raised the equivalent of about 8000000 in 2005 money7 by august 1921 the uk save the children had raised over 1000000 and conditions for children in central europe were improving due to their efforts however the russian famine of 1921 made jebb realize that save the children must be a permanent organization and that childrens rights constantly need to be protected9 their mission was thus changed to an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress7 from 1921 to 1923 save the children created press campaigns propaganda movies and feeding centers in russia and turkey to accommodate and educate thousands of refugees they began to work with several other organizations such as the russian famine relief fund and nansen which resulted in recognition by the league of nations although russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid save the children persuaded soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence3 at home the daily express criticized the funds work denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their people before helping russia the charity responded with increased publicity about the famine showing images of starving children and mass graves the campaign gained national appeal eventually allowing the organization to charter the ss torcello to russia with 600 tons of relief supplies over 157 million rations were given out saving nearly 300000 children improved conditions meant save the childrens russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of 1923 after having won international acclaim310 save the children staff were among the first into the liberated areas after world war ii working with

following the korean war and the 1956 hungarian revolution and the opening of new work in africa asia and the middle east in response to the decline of the british empire7 like other aid agencies save the children was active in the major disasters of the eraespecially the vietnam war and the biafra secession in nigeria the latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the west for the first time in a major way the sort of massmarketing campaigns first used by save the children in the 1920s was repeated with great success in fundraising disasters in ethiopia sudan and many other world hotspots led to appeals that brought public donations on a huge scale and a consequent expansion of the organizations work however the childrens rightsbased approach to development originated by jebb continues to be an important factor it was used in a major campaign in the late 1990s against the use of child soldiers in africa7 during the 2014 ebola outbreak in sierra leone new cases outnumbered the available hospital beds in the country save the children worked with the uk governments department for international development and ministry of
