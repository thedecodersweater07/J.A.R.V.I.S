different sources that microsoft has partnered with2 msn is based in the united states and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world3 its dedicated app is currently available for ios and android systems the first version of msn originally launched on august 24 1995 alongside the release of windows 954 as a subscriptionbased dialup online service called the microsoft network it later became an internet service provider named msn dialup internet access also around this time the company launched a new web portal named microsoft internet start and set it as the default home page of internet explorer its web browser in 1998 microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the domain name msncom where it has remained since5 microsoft subsequently used the msn brand name for a wide variety of products and services over the years notably msn hotmail later outlookcom msn messenger which was once synonymous with msn in internet slang its web search engine which became bing and several other rebranded and discontinued services in 2014 microsoft reworked and relaunched the msn website and suite of apps offered6 following a partial rebranding of the website to microsoft start beginning in 2021 the company reversed course in 2024 and kept msn as the name of the website7 from 1995 to 1998 the msncom domain was primarily used by microsoft to promote the microsoft network as an online service and internet service provider during that period of time msncom also offered a custom start page and an internet tutorial but microsofts major public web portal of that era was known as microsoft internet start and was located at homemicrosoftcom internet start served as the default home page for internet explorer and offered basic information such as news weather sports stocks entertainment reports links to other websites on the internet articles by microsoft staff members and software updates for windows microsofts original news website msnbccom which launched in 1996 and was later divested by microsoft as nbcnewscom was also tied closely to the internet start portal in 1998 the largely underutilized msncom domain name was combined with microsoft internet start and reinvented as both a web portal and as the brand for a family of sites produced inside microsofts interactive media group the new website put msn in direct competition with sites such as yahoo excite and go network because the new format opened up msns content to the world for free the internet service provider and subscription service were renamed to msn internet access at that time that service eventually became known as msn dialup internet access5 the relaunched msncom contained a whole family of sites including original content channels that were carried over from web shows that were part of microsofts msn 20 experiment with its internet service provider in 199697 and new features that were rapidly added msncom became the successor to the default internet explorer start page as all of the previous microsoft internet start website was merged with msncom5 some of the original websites that microsoft launched during that era remained active in some form for decades microsoft investor a business news and investments service that was once produced in conjunction with cnbc became msn money8910 carpoint an automobile comparison and shopping service became msn autos and the internet gaming zone a website offering online casual games became msn games other websites since divested by microsoft include the travel website expedia the

expand the range of msns services some examples include msn adcenter msn shopping affiliated with ebay pricegrabber and shoppingcom and the encarta encyclopedia with various levels of access to information since then msncom remained a popular destination launching many new services and content sites msns hotmail and messenger services were promoted from the msncom portal which provided a central place for all of msns content msn search which became bing a dedicated search engine launched in 1999 the single signin service for microsofts online services microsoft passport later microsoft account also launched across all msn services in 1999 the msncom portal and related group of services under the msn umbrella remained largely the same in the early 2000s this era also saw the introduction of the msn butterfly logo on february 14 2000 which went on to define the brand of all msn services from that point forward11 the sports section of the msn portal was espncom from 2001 to 2004 and foxsportscom from 2004 to 20141213 msn had an exclusive partnership with msnbccom for news content from 1996 until 2012 when microsoft sold its remaining stake in msnbccom to

many of msns services were reorganized in 2005 and 2006 under a new brand name that microsoft championed at the time windows live this move was part of microsofts strategy to improve its online offerings using the windows brand name the company also overhauled its online software and services due to increasing competition from rivals such as yahoo and google the new name was introduced one service at a time the group of windows live services used web 20 technology to offer features and functionality through a web browser that were traditionally only available through dedicated software programs some of the msn services affected by the rebranding included msn hotmail which became windows live hotmail now outlookcom msn messenger which became windows live messenger later integrated into skype msn search which became live search now known as bing msn virtual earth which became live search maps now bing maps msn spaces which became windows live spaces msn alerts which became windows live alerts and msn groups which became windows live groups some other services such as msn direct remained a part of the msn family without transitioning to windows live following the launch of windows live the msn brand took on a different focus msn became primarily an online content provider of news entertainment and common interest topics through its web portal msncom while windows live provided most of microsofts online software and services in 2012 microsoft began to phase out the windows live brand referring to each service separately by its individual brand name without any windows prefix or association23 microsoft launched a completely rewritten and redesigned msn website making use of the companys modern design language on september 30 20146 the new msn portal featured a new version of the logo that followed a style similar to other contemporary microsoft products the website no longer offered original content instead employing editors to repurpose existing content

corresponding apps24 the top of the home page in 2014 provided access to microsoft services bing outlookcom skype office online onenote onedrive bing maps and groove music as well as popular social media services facebook and twitter6 signing into msn with a microsoft account allowed for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the corresponding apps the redesign of the website led to the closure of msns longtime personalized home page service my msn which was made up of customized rss feeds as the new website no longer supported userspecified rss content however it added some customizability allowing each category on the home page to be reordered or hidden with the 2014 relaunch msn began supporting responsive design and eliminated the need for a separate mobile website the redesign of msn proved positive and helped increase traffic with an additional 10 million daily visitors after two months26 in 2021 microsoft began phasing out msn in favor of microsoft start with an updated design news pages being moved to start and ads for the website appearing on the homepage this was reversed in november 2024 with the
