theatre white oak dance project and londons rambert dance company merce cunningham was born in centralia washington in 1919 the second of three sons both of his brothers followed their father clifford d cunningham4 into the legal profession cunningham first experienced dance while living in centralia he took a tap dance class from a local teacher mrs maude barrett whose energy and spirit taught him to love dance her emphasis on precise musical timing and rhythm provided him with a clear understanding of musicality that he implemented in his later dance pieces5 he attended the cornish college of the arts in seattle headed by nellie cornish from 1937 to 1939 to study acting but found dramas reliance on text and miming too limiting and concrete cunningham preferred the ambiguous nature of dance which gave him an outlet for exploration of movement6 during this time martha graham saw cunningham dance and invited him to join her company7 in 1939 cunningham moved to new york city and danced as a soloist in the martha graham dance company for six years he presented his first solo concert in new york in april 1944 with composer john cage who became his lifelong romantic partner and frequent collaborator until cages death in 19928 in the summer of 1953 as a teacher in residence at black mountain college cunningham formed the merce cunningham dance company throughout his career cunningham choreographed more than 200 dances and over 800 events or sitespecific choreographic works in 1963 he joined with cage to create the walker art centers first performance instigating what would be a 25year collaborative relationship with the walker in his performances he often used the i ching to determine the sequence of his dances and often dancers were not informed of the order until the night of the performance in addition to his role as choreographer cunningham performed as a dancer in his company into the early 1990s in 1968 cunningham published his book changes notes on choreography edited by francis starr containing various sketches of his choreography a mural located in washington hall on the campus of centralia college was created in honor of cunningham9 cunningham continued to live in new york city and lead his dance company as artistic director until his death he presented his last work a new work nearly ninety in april 2009 at the brooklyn academy of music new york to mark his 90th birthday10 later that year he died in his home at the age of 9011 cunningham formed merce cunningham dance company mcdc at black mountain college in 1953 guided by its leaders radical approach to space time and technology the company has forged a distinctive style reflecting cunninghams technique and illuminating the near limitless possibility for human movement the original company included dancers carolyn brown viola farber marianne pregersimon paul taylor and remy charlip and musicians john cage and david tudor in 1964 the cunningham dance foundation was established to support his work12 mcdc made its first international tour in 1964 visiting europe and asia12 from 1971 until its dissolution in 2012 the company was based in the westbeth artists community in the west village for a time cunningham himself lived a block away at 107 bank street with john cage on july 20 1999 merce cunningham and mikhail baryshnikov performed together at the new york state theater for cunninghams 80th birthday13 in its later years the company had a twoyear residency at dia beacon where mcdc performed events cunninghams sitespecific choreographic collages in the galleries of richard serra dan flavin and sol lewitt among others in 2007 mcdc premiered xover cunninghams final collaboration with rauschenberg at dartmouth college in new hampshire in 2009 mcdc premiered cunninghams newest work nearly ninety at the brooklyn academy of music the company concluded its farewell tour on december 31 201114 with a performance at the park avenue armory15 merce cunningham dance company frequently collaborated with visual artists architects designers and musicians many of cunninghams most famous innovations were developed in collaboration with composer john cage his life partner cunningham and cage used chance procedures to generate material discarding many artistic traditions of narrative and form famously they asserted that dance and its music should not be intentionally coordinated with one another16 john cage after his death was succeeded in the role of music director by david tudor after 1995 mcdcs music director was takehisa kosugi mcdc commissioned more work from contemporary composers than any other dance company its repertory included works by musicians ranging from cage and gordon mumma to gavin bryars as well as popular bands like radiohead sigur rs and sonic youth17 the company also collaborated with an array of visual artists and designers robert rauschenberg whose famous combines reflect the approach he used to create dcor for several mcdcs early works served as the companys resident designer from 1954 through 1964 jasper johns followed as artistic advisor from 1967 until 1980 and mark lancaster from 1980 through 1984 the last advisors to be appointed were william anastasi and dove bradshaw in 1984 other artists who have collaborated with mcdc include daniel arsham tacita dean liz phillips rei kawakubo roy lichtenstein bruce nauman ernesto neto frank stella benedetta tagliabue and andy warhol john cage and i became interested in the use of chance in the 50s i think one of the very primary things that happened then was the publication of the i ching the chinese book of changes from which you can cast your fortune the hexagrams cage took it to work in his way of making compositions then and he used the idea of 64the number of the hexagrams to say that you had 64 for example sounds then you could cast by chance to find which sound first appeared cast again to say which sound came second cast again so that its done by in that sense chance operations instead of finding out what you think should followsay a particular soundwhat did the i ching suggest well i took this also for dance i was working on a title called untitled solo and i had madeusing the chance operationsa series of movements written on scraps of paper for the legs and the arms the head all different and it was done not to the music but with the music of christian wolff merce cunningham merce cunningham a lifetime of dance 2000 cunningham valued the process of a work over the product because of his strong interest in the creation of the choreography he used chance procedures in his work a chance procedure means that the order of the steps or sequence is unknown until the actual performance and is decided by chance for instance in his work suite by chance he used the toss of a coin to determine how to put the choreographed sequences together indeterminacy was another part of cunninghams work many of his pieces had sections or sequences that were rehearsed so that they could be put in any order and done at any time18 although the use of chance operations was considered an abrogation of artistic responsibility19 cunningham was thrilled by a process that arrives at works that could never have been created through traditional collaboration this does not mean however that cunningham considered every piece created in this fashion a masterpiece those dances that did not work were quickly dropped from the repertory while those that did were celebrated as serendipitous discoveries cunningham used nonrepresentational choreography which simply emphasizes movement and does not necessarily represent any historical narrative emotional situation or idea such nonrepresentational dance appears in many styles throughout history but was not commonly used by ballet or martha graham cunninghams primary influences in the use of chance procedures cunningham abandoned the more traditional structured form of dance he did not believe that dance needs a beginning middle or end1820 in sixteen dances for soloist and company of three 1951 cunningham used indeterminacy for the first time in this piece the changing element for each show was the sequence of the sections in field dances 1963 cunningham experimented with giving the dancer more freedom each dancer was given a sequence of movements with which they could do as they pleased this included exiting and entering at will executing it in any order and as many times as desired in story 1963 cunningham experimented with the variables of costumes and sets before each performance dancers chose an outfit from a pile of secondhand clothes picked out by the designer robert rauschenberg rauschenberg was also responsible for creating a new set for every show with items he found in the theatre suite by chance 1953 was his first work made entirely through chance procedures charts were created listing elements such as space time and positions a coin was then tossed to determine each of these elements canfield 1969 was created by using playing cards each movement was assigned a playing card and chosen randomly21 cunninghams lifelong passion for exploration and innovation made him a leader in applying new technologies to the arts he began investigating dance on film in the 1970s and after 1991 choreographed using the computer program lifeforms a software made by zella wolofsky tom calvert and thecla schiphorst22 cunningham explored motion capture technology with digital artists paul kaiser and shelley eshkar to create handdrawn spaces a threescreen animation that was commissioned by and premiered at siggraph in 1998 this led to a live dance for the stage biped for which kaiser and eshkar provided the projected decor in 2008 cunningham released his loops choreography for the hands as motioncapture data under a creative commons license this was the basis for the opensource collaboration of the same name with the openended group cunningham was one of the first choreographers to begin experimenting with film he created an original work for the video westbeth 1974 in collaboration with filmmaker charles atlas18 the computer program later became danceforms and uses avatars of dancers with colorcoded limbs as a platform for choreography23 in 2009 cunninghams interest in new media led to the creation of the behindthescenes webcast mondays with merce24 the use of stage space also changed in cunninghams choreography the front and centre spot traditionally coveted by soloists no longer exists in his works dance can take place on any part of the stage it need not even be frontally oriented but can be viewed from any angle at performances in cunninghams studio for instance audiences are seated in an lshaped configuration the viewers focus is never directed to a particular spot he must often decide among many centres of activity25 merce cunningham saw randomness and arbitrariness as positive qualities because they exist in real life18 most of cunninghams choreographic process works to break the boundaries of putting on a show the removal of centre stage is an example of thiswithout a focal point for the audience no one dancer or step holds the most value and can be seen as arbitrary or not the cunningham dance foundation announced the legacy plan in june 2009 the plan provided a roadmap for the future of the merce cunningham dance company as envisioned by cunningham the first of its kind in the dance world the plan represented cunninghams vision for continuing his work in the upcoming years transitioning his company once he was no longer able to lead it and preserving his oeuvre the legacy plan included a comprehensive digital documentation and preservation program which ensures that pieces from his repertory can be studied performed and enjoyed by future generations with knowledge of how they originally came to life by other provisions of the plan the merce cunningham trust established by cunningham to serve as the custodian for his works controls his dances for licensing purposes cunningham associates prepared detailed records of the dances so they could be licensed and given authentic productions by other companies26 the legacy plan also outlined a final international tour for the company and ultimately the closure of the cunningham dance foundation and merce cunningham dance company and the transfer of all assets to the merce cunningham trust from merces death at age 90 through the boards last meeting in 2012 the legacy plan implemented his wish that the company complete a worldwide legacy tour and then close the final performance of the merce cunningham dance company was on december 31 2011 at the park avenue armory in new york city the final meeting of the board of directors for the merce cunningham dance company was held march 15 2012 in cunninghams studio at the top of the westbeth building in the west village27 there have been numerous exhibitions
