on 31 august 2025 at 2347 aft 1917 utc a mw 60 earthquake struck eastern afghanistan near the border with pakistan the epicenter of the quake was located in nurgal district kunar province it had a hypocenter eight kilometres 5 miles beneath the surface and a maximum modified mercalli intensity of ix violent in nurgal several geological and structural factors led to a relatively heavy impact for the earthquakes relatively moderate size with more than 2200 deaths 4000 injuries and 8000 collapsed homes almost all of the casualties and destruction occurred in five districts of kunar province where almost all buildings were damaged or destroyed with nearby provinces also suffering damage and casualites it was the deadliest earthquake to affect afghanistan since 19982 much of afghanistan is situated in a broad zone of continental deformation within the eurasian plate seismic activity in afghanistan is influenced by the subduction of the arabian plate to the west and the oblique subduction of the indian plate in the east the subduction rate of the indian plate along the continental convergent boundary is estimated to be 39 mmyr or higher transpression due to the plates interacting is associated with high seismicity within the shallow crust seismicity is detectable to a depth of 300 km 190 mi beneath afghanistan due to plate subduction3 these earthquakes beneath the hindu kush are the result of movement on faults accommodating detachment of the subducted crust4 within the shallow crust the chaman fault represents a major transform fault associated with large shallow earthquakes that forms the transpressional boundary between the eurasian and indian plates this zone consists of seismically active thrust and strikeslip faults that have accommodated crustal deformation since the beginning of the formation of the himalayan orogeny these earthquakes tend to display strikeslip faulting due to its abundance and high deformation rate5 the earthquake occurred as a result of thrust faulting on a shallow fault this fault was either a northeastsouthwest striking fault dipping northwest or westnorthwestsouthsoutheast striking fault dipping southsoutheast6 its epicenter was located in nurgal district in kunar province 37 km 23 mi westsouthwest of the city of asadabad and 27 km 17 mi west of the border with khyber pakhtunkhwa province in pakistan it had a hypocenter 8 km 50 mi beneath the surface7 a maximum modified mercalli intensity of ix violent was estimated by the united states geological survey usgs according to the usgs prompt assessment of global earthquakes for response service approximately 18000 people were within the zone of intensity ix and 107000 people were exposed to viii severe shaking the mmi of the earthquake was estimated to have reached ix at nurgal district viii at chawkay and kuz kunar districts vii very strong at jalalabad and iv light at kabul and the pakistani cities of peshawar and islamabad7 tremors were also felt in lahore and in parts of india including delhi8 at least 17 aftershocks were reportedly felt by 1 september9 the largest aftershock measured mww 56 and struck about 1 km 062 mi northeast of the mainshock at 2126 aft on 4 september with a maximum modified mercalli intensity of viii10 the gfz helmholtz centre for geosciences gfz reported a magnitude of mb 6311 the earthquake killed at least 2217 people left around 4000 injured12 and destroyed 8000 homes13 the usgs estimated between 1000 and 10000 deaths were possible with nearly 890000 people exposed to very strong to violent shaking7 most of the affected homes were made of mud and stone14 the majority of which were built on steep valleys15 doshisha university professor tsutsumi hiroyuki said the destruction and high death toll were attributed to the earthquakes shallow depth low quality building materials and the ground beneath the epicentral area comprising soft sediments which significantly amplified ground motions16 heavy rains in the days before the earthquake also exacerbated the destruction and put the area at risk of landslides17 many affected residents were among four million illegal migrants who had been deported from iran and pakistan18 filippo grandi the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimated that more than 500000 people were affected19 with many others being displaced20 save the children estimated that 260000 children were among those affected with 280 being orphaned due to the earthquake2 a day after the earthquake the full scale of the damage had yet to be known with many affected villages still unreachable21 at least 2205 people were killed 3640 others were injured22 5400 homes23 and up to 65 of buildings collapsed and 98 of structures were damaged24 in kunar province with five districts there particularly affected25 hundreds of casualties were feared in nurgal district alone26 and the villages of wadir shomash masud and areet were reportedly destroyed with many others being substantially damaged1727 up to 90 of residents were feared dead or injured in wadir28 in the village of mazaredara where a resident said 95 of homes were destroyed29 dozens of fatalities and nearly a hundred injuries were reported30 while 79 villagers died in andarlachak9 an additional 200 deaths and 500 injuries were reported in chawkay district21 roads in kunar including the one connecting the province with jalalabad were blocked by landslides caused by the earthquake aftershocks and heavy rains preventing many areas from being accessed quickly2631 in nangarhar province 12 people were killed and 255 others were injured in darai nur district32 eighty people were injured in laghman province26 six of them seriously21 fiftyeight of the injuries in the province occurred in alingar district32 at least 14 homes collapsed in the province33 four people were injured in nurgram district nuristan province and in neighboring panjshir province five houses were destroyed in abshar32 on 2 september a magnitude 52 aftershock34 caused additional damage some injuries and landslides that blocked roads and slowed rescue efforts in the worsthit areas3536 a series of five aftershocks the largest of which measured mw 56 aftershock struck on the evening of 45 september causing two additional deaths including one due to a house collapse in sirkanay district injuring 51 others 22 in nangarhar 20 in kunar and 9 in laghman and destroying 30 homes in kunar laghman and nangarhar provinces fourteen of the injured were students jumping from windows at syed jamaluddin
