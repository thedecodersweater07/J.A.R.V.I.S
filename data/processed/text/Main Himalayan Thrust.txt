the main himalayan thrust mht is a dcollement under the himalaya range this thrust fault follows a northwestsoutheast strike reminiscent of an arc and gently dips about 10 degrees towards the north beneath the region it is the largest active continental megathrust1 fault in the world2 the mht accommodates crustal shortening of india and eurasia as a result of the ongoing collision between the indian and eurasian plates3 the mht absorbs around 20mmyr of slip nearly half of the total convergence rate this slip can be released from smallscale earthquakes and some plastic deformation but the mht still accumulates a deficit of moment of 661019 nmyr the mht also remains locked with the overlying eurasian plate from its surface expression to the front of the higher himalayas nearly 100 kilometres away this locking mechanism combined with the rapid accumulation of deficit of moment are concerning as some professionals estimate that earthquakes up to the size of 89 on the richter scale could be in order for regions such as western nepal earthquakes of this magnitude are estimated to have a return period of over 1000 years in this region4 deformation of the crust is also accommodated along splay structures including the main frontal thrust mft main boundary thrust mbt main central thrust mct and possibly the south tibetan detachment the mht is the root detachment of these splays currently the mft and mht accounts for almost the entire rate of convergence 1521 mmyr56 this fault defines where the indian subcontinent is underthrust beneath the himalayan orogenic wedge the mht is a known hazard and potential source for large earthquakes of magnitude 80 or greater the mht is also associated with other large 20thcentury earthquakes such as the 1934 nepalindia earthquake and the 1950 assamtibet earthquake within the last thousand years multiple earthquakes have occurred with magnitudes of at least mw 80 as deduced by paleoseismology michel et al 2021 suggested the maximum magnitude possible on the mht to be mw 87 with a recurrence interval of 200 years7 in april 2015 a section of the mht produced a blind rupture earthquake killing nearly 9000 people89 researchers who published their findings in nature geoscience revealed that the mw 78 earthquake failed to rupture towards the surface thus still leaving the possibility of future large earthquakes since the rupture ceased 11 km 68 mi beneath the kathmandu region a shallow section of the mht south of the region remains unruptured and could produce an earthquake of comparable size the research lead j r elliott says such an earthquake could be more devastating because of its shallowness10 the main himalayan thrust and its splay branches has been the source of numerous earthquakes including some that are indirectly related
