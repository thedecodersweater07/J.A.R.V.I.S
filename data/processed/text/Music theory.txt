music theory is the study of theoretical frameworks for understanding the practices and possibilities of music the oxford companion to music describes three interrelated uses of the term music theory the first is the rudiments that are needed to understand music notation key signatures time signatures and rhythmic notation the second is learning scholars views on music from antiquity to the present the third is a subtopic of musicology that seeks to define processes and general principles in music the musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis in that it takes as its startingpoint not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built1 music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics because of the everexpanding conception of what constitutes music a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena including silence this is not an absolute guideline however for example the study of music in the quadrivium liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practicen 1 but this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theoryn 2 music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts that composers and other musicians use in creating and performing music the development preservation and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written musicmaking traditions musical instruments and other artifacts for example ancient instruments from prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers in ancient and living cultures around the world the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments oral traditions and current musicmaking many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation practical and scholarly traditions overlap as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research in modern academia music theory is a subfield of musicology the wider study of musical cultures and history guido adler however in one of the texts that founded musicology in the late 19th century wrote that the science of music originated at the same time as the art of sounds3 where the science of music musikwissenschaft obviously meant music theory adler added that music only could exist when one began measuring pitches and comparing them to each other he concluded that all people for which one can speak of an art of sounds also have a science of sounds4 one must deduce that music theory exists in all musical cultures of the world music theory is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems scales consonance and dissonance and rhythmic relationships there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects such as the creation or the performance of music orchestration ornamentation improvisation and electronic sound production5 a person who researches or teaches music theory is a music theorist university study typically to the ma or phd level is required to teach as a tenuretrack music theorist in a us or canadian university methods of analysis include mathematics graphic analysis and especially analysis enabled by western music notation comparative descriptive statistical and other methods are also used music theory textbooks especially in the united states of america often include elements of musical acoustics considerations of musical notation and techniques of tonal composition harmony and counterpoint among other topics several surviving sumerian and akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature mainly lists of intervals and tunings6 the scholar sam mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500 bce a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought further all the mesopotamian texts about music are united by the use of a terminology for music that according to the approximate dating of the texts was in use for over 1000 years7 much of chinese music history and theory remains unclear8 chinese theory starts from numbers the main musical numbers being twelve five and eight twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed five refers to the pentatonic scale primarily uses a 5note scale and eight refers to the eight categories of chinese music instruments classified by the material they are made from metal stone silk bamboo gourd clay leather and wood the lshi chunqiu from about 238 bce recalls the legend of ling lun on order of the yellow emperor ling lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes blowing on one of these like a pipe he found its sound agreeable and named it huangzhong the yellow bell he then heard phoenixes singing the male and female phoenix each sang six tones ling lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets six from the male phoenix and six from the female these were called the ll or later the shierl9 apart from technical and structural aspects ancient chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music the yueji record of music c1st and 2nd centuries bce for example manifests confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context studied and implemented by confucian scholarofficials these theories helped form a musical confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches these include the assertion of mozi c 468 c 376 bce that music wasted human and material resources and laozis claim that the greatest music had no sounds even the music of the qin zither a genre closely affiliated with confucian scholarofficials includes many works with daoist references such as tianfeng huanpei heavenly breeze and sounds of jade pendants8 the samaveda and yajurveda c 1200 1000 bce are among the earliest testimonies of indian music but properly speaking they contain no theory the natya shastra written between 200 bce to 200 ce discusses intervals rutis scales grmas consonances and dissonances classes of melodic structure mrchans modes melodic types jtis instruments etc10 early preserved greek writings on music theory include two types of works11 several names of theorists are known before these works including pythagoras c 570 c 495 bce philolaus c 470 c 385 bce archytas 428347 bce and others works of the first type technical manuals include more philosophical treatises of the second type include the pipa instrument carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the sui and tang theory of 84 musical modes8 medieval arabic music theorists includen 3 the latin treatise de institutione musica by the roman philosopher boethius written c 500 translated as fundamentals of music2 was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval europe boethius represented classical authority on music during the middle ages as the greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later europeans until the 15th century21 this treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes several centuries later treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the plainchant tradition22 at the end of the ninth century hucbald worked towards more precise pitch notation for the neumes used to record plainchant guido darezzo wrote a letter to michael of pomposa in 1028 entitled epistola de ignoto cantu23 in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals this was the source of the hexachordal solmization that was to be used until the end of the middle ages guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes the phrase structure of plainchant the temporal meaning of the neumes etc his chapters on polyphony come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account in the western tradition21 during the thirteenth century a new rhythm system called mensural notation grew out of an earlier more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns the socalled rhythmic modes which were developed in france around 1200 an early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ars cantus mensurabilis the art of measured chant by franco of cologne c 1280 mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern it is a proportional notation in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value or half or a third of the longer value this same notation transformed through various extensions and improvements during the renaissance forms the basis for rhythmic notation in european classical music today derlanger divulges that the arabic music scale is derived from the greek music scale and that arabic music is connected to certain features of arabic culture such as astrology20 music is composed of aural phenomena music theory considers how those phenomena apply in music music theory considers melody rhythm counterpoint harmony form tonal systems scales tuning intervals consonance dissonance durational proportions the acoustics of pitch systems composition performance orchestration ornamentation improvisation electronic sound production etc27 pitch is the lowness or highness of a tone for example the difference between middle c and a higher c the frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies accordingly theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound28 specific frequencies are often assigned letter names today most orchestras assign concert a the a above middle c on the piano to the frequency of 440 hz this assignment is somewhat arbitrary for example in 1859 france the same a was tuned to 435 hz such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena thus in historically informed performance of older music tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written additionally many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre style mood etc the difference in pitch between two notes is called an interval the most basic interval is the unison which is simply two notes of the same pitch the octave interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another the unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of pitch class pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single class by ignoring the difference in octave for example a high c and a low c are members of the same pitch classthe class that contains all cs29 musical tuning systems or temperaments determine the precise size of intervals tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures in western culture there have long been several competing tuning systems all with different qualities internationally the system known as equal temperament is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning eg the piano to sound acceptably in tune in all keys notes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve pitches called a chromatic scale within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a semitone or half step selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales30 the most commonly encountered scales are the seventoned major the harmonic minor the melodic minor and the natural minor other examples of scales are the octatonic scale and the pentatonic or fivetone scale which is common in folk music and blues nonwestern cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelvetone division of the octave for example classical ottoman persian indian and arabic musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones half the size of a semitone as the name indicates for instance in neutral seconds three quarter tones or neutral thirds seven quarter tonesthey do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval30 in traditional western notation the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale as the music progresses the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes often to accommodate the range of a vocalist such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale for example transposition from the key of c major to d major raises all pitches of the scale of c major equally by a whole tone since the interval relationships remain unchanged transposition may be unnoticed by a listener however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music this often affects the musics overall sound as well as having technical implications for the performers31 the interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition during the baroque period emotional associations with specific keys known as the doctrine of the affections were an important topic in music theory but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament however many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states times of day and other extramusical concepts and notably does not employ equal temperament consonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages consonance or concord is a feeling that an interval or chord is stable harmonious or complete while dissonance or discord is a feeling that the interval or chords are incomplete clashing or unresolved in western music theory perfect fourths fifths and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant while other intervals are considered dissonant to a greater or lesser degree32 context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance for example in a debussy prelude a major second may sound stable and consonant while the same interval may sound dissonant in a bach fugue in the common practice era the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth since the early 20th century arnold schoenbergs concept of emancipated dissonance in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as higher more remote consonances has become more widely accepted32 rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time meter measures music in regular pulse groupings called measures or bars the time signature or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat through increased stress or variations in duration or articulation particular tones may be accented there are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter syncopated rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat33 playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called polyrhythm34 in recent years rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars the most highly cited of these recent scholars are maury yeston35 fred lerdahl and ray jackendoff36 jonathan kramer37 and justin london38 a melody is a group of sounds in succession a tune or an arrangement40 melody is often a prominent aspect of music and so its construction and qualities are a primary interest of music theory the basic elements of melody are pitch duration rhythm and tempo the tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as scales or modes melody may consist to increasing degree of the figure motive semiphrase antecedent and consequent phrase and period or sentence the period may be considered the complete melody however some examples combine two periods or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies41 a chord in music is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously42 pp 67 359 43 p 63 these need not actually be played together arpeggios and broken chords may for many practical and theoretical purposes constitute chords chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern western west african44 and oceanian45 music whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world46 p 15 the most frequently encountered chords are triads so called because they consist of three distinct notes further notes may be added to give seventh chords extended chords or added tone chords the most common chords are the major and minor triads and then the augmented and diminished triads the descriptions major minor augmented and diminished are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal quality chords are also commonly classed by their root noteso for instance the chord c major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note c chords may also be classified by inversion the order in which the notes are stacked a series of chords is called a chord progression although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing key in commonpractice harmony to describe this chords are numbered using roman numerals upward from the keynote47 per their diatonic function common ways of notating or representing chords48 in western music other than conventional staff notation include roman numerals figured bass much used in the baroque era chord letters sometimes used in modern musicology and various systems of chord charts typically found in the lead sheets used in popular music to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo in music harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches tones notes or chords46 p 15 the study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them49 harmony is often said to refer to the vertical aspect of music as distinguished from melodic line or the horizontal aspect50 counterpoint which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines and polyphony which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices is thus sometimes distinguished from harmony51 in popular and jazz harmony chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities for example a lead sheet may indicate chords such as c major d minor and g dominant seventh in many types of music notably baroque romantic modern and jazz chords are often augmented with tensions a tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass it is part of a chord but is not one of the chord tones 1 3 5 7 typically in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord chord with tension resolves to a consonant chord harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds in simple words that occurs when there is a balance between tense and relaxed moments52unreliable source timbre sometimes called color or tone color is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright dull shrill etc it is of considerable interest in music theory especially because it is one component of music that has as yet no standardized nomenclature it has been called the psychoacousticians multidimensional wastebasket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness53 but can be accurately described and analyzed by fourier analysis and other methods54 because it results from the combination of all sound frequencies attack and release envelopes and other qualities that a tone comprises timbre is principally determined by two things 1 the relative balance of overtones produced by a given instrument due its construction eg shape material and 2 the envelope of the sound including changes in the overtone structure over time timbre varies widely between different instruments voices and to lesser degree between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction and significantly the performers technique the timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing for example the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell the player changes their embouchure or volumecitation needed a voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus eg the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique volume accent and other means these are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction for example the word dolce sweetly indicates a nonspecific but commonly understood soft and sweet timbre sul tasto instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound cuivre instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound accent symbols like marcato and dynamic indications pp can also indicate changes in timbre55 in music dynamics normally refers to variations of intensity or volume as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in decibels or phons in music notation however dynamics are not treated as absolute values but as relative ones because they are usually measured subjectively there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity such as timbre vibrato and articulation the conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for italian words like forte f for loud and piano p for soft these two basic notations are modified by indications including mezzo piano mp for moderately soft literally half soft and mezzo forte mf for moderately loud sforzando or sforzato sfz for a surging or pushed attack or fortepiano fp for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level the full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible pianissississimo pppp to a loudaspossible fortissississimo ffff greater extremes of pppppp and fffff and nuances such as p or pi piano are sometimes found other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis db decibels numerical scales colored or different sized notes words in languages other than italian and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume crescendo or decreasing volume diminuendo or decrescendo often called hairpins when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above articulation is the way the performer sounds notes for example staccato is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value legato performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation articulation is often described rather than quantified therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation for example staccato is often referred to as separated or detached rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of staccato the manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period eg viol wind classical baroque etc there is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common they arefrom long to short legato smooth connected tenuto pressed or played to full notated duration marcato accented and detached staccato separated detached martel heavily accented or hammeredcontradictory many of these can be combined to create certain inbetween articulations for example portato is the combination of tenuto and staccato some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds such as spiccato for bowed strings where the bow bounces off the string in music texture is how the melodic rhythmic and harmonic materials are combined in a composition thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece texture is often described in regard to the density or thickness and range or width between lowest and highest pitches in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices or parts and the relationship between these voices for example a thick texture contains many layers of instruments one of these layers could be a string section or another brass the thickness also is affected by the number and the richness of the instruments playing the piece the thickness varies from light to thick a lightly textured piece will have light sparse scoring a thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments a pieces texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony tempo and rhythms used57 the types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements primary melody secondary melody parallel supporting melody static support harmonic support rhythmic support and harmonic and rhythmic support58incomplete short citation common types included monophonic texture a single melodic voice such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute biphonic texture two melodic voices such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody polyphonic texture and homophonic texture chords accompanying a melodycitation needed the term musical form or musical architecture refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections60 in the tenth edition of the oxford companion to music percy scholes defines musical form as a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration61 according to richard middleton musical form is the shape or structure of the work he describes it through difference the distance moved from a repeat the latter being the smallest difference difference is quantitative and qualitative how far and of what type different in many cases form depends on statement and restatement unity and variety and contrast and connection62 musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication the elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications such as forte or piano phrasing differing qualities of timbre and articulation color intensity energy and excitement all of these devices can be incorporated by the performer a performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience and to excite calm or otherwise sway the audiences physical and emotional responses musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing and the voices natural ability to express feelings sentiment and deep emotionsclarification needed whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners63 the emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds eg a startlinglyloud bang and of learned associations eg a national anthem but can rarely be completely separated from its contextcitation needed the components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute646566676869 musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music this is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations there are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages traditional western notation evolved during the middle ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation70 in the 2000s computer file formats have become important as well71 spoken language and hand signs are also used to symbolically represent music primarily in teaching in standard western music notation tones are represented graphically by symbols notes placed on a staff or staves the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time note head shapes stems flags ties and dots are used to indicate duration additional symbols indicate keys dynamics accents rests etc verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo technique and other aspects in western music a range of different music notation systems are used in western classical music conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out in popular styles of music much less of the music may be notated a rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the songs chord progression using chord names eg c major d minor g7 etc all of the chord voicings rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members the scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question how does this music work the method employed to answer this question and indeed exactly what is meant by the question differs from analyst to analyst and according to the purpose of the analysis according to ian bent analysis as a pursuit in its own right came to be established only in the late 19th century its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s however it existed as a scholarly tool albeit an auxiliary one from the middle ages onwards72incomplete short citation adolf bernhard marx was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century the principle of analysis has been variously criticized especially by composers such as edgard varses claim that to explain by means of analysis is to decompose to mutilate the spirit of a work73 schenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of heinrich schenker 18681935 the goal of a schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure the theorys basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining tonality in music a schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy the analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration the most fundamental concept of schenkers theory of tonality may be that of tonal space74 the intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a tonal space that is filled with passing and neighbour notes producing new triads and new tonal spaces open for further elaborations until the surface of the work the score is reached although schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction starting from the fundamental structure ursatz to reach the score the practice of schenkerian analysis more often is reductive starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure the graph of the ursatz is arrhythmic as is a strictcounterpoint cantus firmus exercise75 even at intermediate levels of the reduction rhythmic notation open and closed noteheads beams and flags shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitchevents schenkerian analysis is subjective there is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst76 the analysis represents a way of hearing and reading a piece of music transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by david lewin in the 1980s and formally introduced in his 1987 work generalized musical intervals and transformations the theory which models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group can be used to analyze both tonal and atonal music the goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objectssuch as the c major chord or g major chordto relations between objects thus instead of saying that a c major chord is followed by g major a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been transformed into the second by the dominant operation symbolically one might write dominantc major g major while traditional musical set theory focuses on the makeup of musical objects transformational theory focuses on the intervals or types of musical motion that can occur according to lewins description of this change in emphasis the transformational attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified points rather it asks if i am at s and wish to get to t what characteristic gesture should i perform in order to arrive there77 music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both psychology and musicology it aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience including the processes through which music is perceived created responded to and incorporated into everyday life7879 modern music psychology is primarily empirical its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas including music performance composition education criticism and therapy as well as investigations of human aptitude skill intelligence creativity and social behavior music psychology can shed light on nonpsychological aspects of musicology and musical practice for example it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody harmony tonality rhythm meter and form research in music history can benefit from systematic study of the history of musical syntax or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual affective and social responses to their music a music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions80 it is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably81failed verification music can be divided into different genres in many different ways the artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial and some genres may overlap there are even varying academic definitions of the term genre itself in his book form in tonal music douglass m green distinguishes between genre and form he lists madrigal motet canzona ricercar and dance as examples of genres from the renaissance period to further clarify the meaning of genre green writes beethovens op 61 and mendelssohns op 64 are identical in genreboth are violin concertosbut different in form however mozarts rondo for piano k 511 and the agnus dei from his mass k 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form82 some like peter van der merwe treat the terms genre and style as the same saying that genre should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or basic musical language83 others such as allan f moore state that genre and style are two separate terms and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres84 a music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques the style the cultural context and the content and spirit of the themes geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres timothy laurie argues that since the early 1980s genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects85 musical technique is the ability of instrumental and vocal musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or vocal cords to produce precise musical effects improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility to improve technique musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the natural minor major and chromatic scales minor and major triads dominant and diminished sevenths formula patterns and arpeggios for example triads and sevenths teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed scales teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another usually by step arpeggios teach how to play broken chords over larger intervals many of these components of music are found in compositions for example a scale is a very common element of classical and romantic era compositionscitation needed heinrich schenker argued that musical techniques most striking and distinctive characteristic is repetition86 works known as tudes meaning study are also frequently used for the improvement of technique music theorists sometimes use mathematics to understand music and although music has no axiomatic foundation in modern mathematics mathematics is the basis of sound and sound itself in its musical aspects exhibits a remarkable array of number properties simply because nature itself is amazingly mathematical87 the attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory abstract algebra and number theory some composers have incorporated the golden ratio and fibonacci numbers into their work8889 there is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics though ancient chinese egyptians and mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound90 the pythagoreans in particular philolaus and archytas91 of ancient greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios in the modern era musical set theory uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships to analyze the structure of a piece of typically atonal music using musical set theory one usually starts with a set of tones which could form motives or chords by applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion one can discover deep structures in the music operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set expanding on the methods of musical set theory some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music for example the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements it is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group92 in music theory serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements serialism began primarily with arnold schoenbergs twelvetone technique though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of posttonal thinking twelvetone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a compositions melody harmony structural progressions and variations other types of serialism also work with sets collections of objects but not necessarily with fixedorder series and extend the technique to other musical dimensions often called parameters such as duration dynamics and timbre the idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts design and architecture93 integral serialism or total serialism is the use of series for aspects such as duration dynamics and register as well as pitch94 other terms used especially in europe to distinguish postworld war ii serial music from twelvetone music and its american extensions are general serialism and multiple serialism95 musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships many of the notions were first elaborated by howard hanson 1960 in connection with tonal music and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as allen forte 1973 drawing on the work in twelvetone theory of milton babbitt the concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system and to some extent more generally than thatcitation needed one branch of musical set theory deals with collections sets and permutations of pitches and pitch classes pitchclass set theory which may be ordered or unordered and can be related by musical operations such as transposition inversion and complementation the methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as wellcitation needed music semiology semiotics is the study of

for centuries but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent in the 1970s few universities had dedicated music theory programs many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right106 a growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists rather than composers performers or music historians106 this led to the founding of the society for music theory in the united states in 1977 in europe the french socit danalyse musicale was founded in 1985 it called the first european conference of music analysis for 1989 which resulted in the foundation of the socit belge danalyse musicale in belgium and the gruppo analisi e teoria musicale in italy the same year the society for music analysis in the uk in 1991 the vereniging voor muziektheorie in the netherlands in 1999 and the gesellschaft fr musiktheorie in germany in 2000107 they were later followed by the russian society for music theory in 2013 the polish society for music analysis in 2015 and the sociedad de anlisis y teora musical in spain in 2020 and others are in construction these societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers they formed in 2018 a network of european societies for theory andor analysis of music the eurotam as part of their initial training music theorists will typically complete a bmus or a ba in music or a related field and in many cases an ma in music theory some individuals apply directly from a bachelors degree to a phd and in these cases they may not receive an ma in the 2010s given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs some applicants for music theory phd programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music eg a student may apply with a bmus and a masters in music composition or philosophy of music most music theorists work as instructors lecturers or professors in colleges universities or conservatories the job market for tenuretrack professor positions is very competitive with an average of around 25 tenuretrack positions advertised per year in the past decade 80100 phd graduates are produced each year according to the survey of earned doctorates who compete not only with each other for those positions but with job seekers that received phds in previous years who are still searching for a tenuretrack job applicants must hold a completed phd or the equivalent degree or expect to receive one within a year of being hiredcalled an abd for all but dissertation stage and for more senior positions have a strong record of publishing in peerreviewed journals some phdholding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers the job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline teaching undergraduate andor graduate classes in this area of specialization and in many cases some general courses such as music appreciation or introduction to music theory conducting research in this area of expertise publishing research articles in peerreviewed journals authoring book chapters books or textbooks traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field and if the program includes a graduate school supervising ma and phd students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution such as dean or chair of the school of music
