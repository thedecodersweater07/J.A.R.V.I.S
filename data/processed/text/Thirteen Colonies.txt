the thirteen colonies were the english colonies and later british colonies on the atlantic coast of north america which broke away from the british crown in the american revolutionary war 17751783 and joined to form the united states of america the thirteen colonies in their traditional groupings were the new england colonies new hampshire massachusetts rhode island and connecticut the middle colonies new york new jersey pennsylvania and delaware and the southern colonies maryland virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia2 these colonies were part of british america which also included territory in the floridas the caribbean and what is today canada3 the thirteen colonies were separately administered under the crown but had similar political constitutional and legal systems and each was dominated by protestant englishspeakers the first of the colonies virginia was established at jamestown in 1607 maryland pennsylvania and the new england colonies were substantially motivated by their founders concerns related to the practice of religion the other colonies were founded for business and economic expansion the middle colonies were established on the former dutch colony of new netherland between 1625 and 1775 the colonial population grew from 2 thousand to 24 million largely displacing the regions native americans the population included people subject to a system of slavery which was legal in all of the colonies in the 18th century the british government operated under a policy of mercantilism in which the central government administered its colonies for britains economic benefit the 13 colonies had a degree of selfgovernance and active local electionsa and they resisted londons demands for more control over them the french and indian war 17541763 against france and its indian allies led to growing tensions between britain and the 13 colonies during the 1750s the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with britain with the help of colonial printers and newspapers these intercolonial activities and concerns were shared and led to calls for protection of the colonists rights as englishmen especially the principle of no taxation without representation late 18th century conflicts with the british government over taxes and rights led to the american revolution in which the thirteen colonies joined for the first time to form the continental congress and raised the continental army declaring independence in 1776 they fought the revolutionary war with the aid of the kingdom of france and to a much lesser degree the dutch republic and the kingdom of spain6 in 1606 king james i of england granted charters to both the plymouth company and the london company for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in america the london company established the colony of virginia in 1607 the first permanently settled english colony on the continent the plymouth company founded the popham colony on the kennebec river but it was shortlived the plymouth council for new england sponsored several colonization projects culminating with plymouth colony in 1620 which was settled by english puritan separatists known today as the pilgrims7 the dutch swedish and french also established successful american colonies at roughly the same time as the english but they eventually came under the english crown the thirteen colonies were complete with the establishment of the province of georgia in 1732 although the term thirteen colonies became current only in the context of the american revolutionb in london beginning in 1660 all colonies were governed through a state department known as the southern department and a committee of the privy council called the board of trade and plantations in 1768 a specific state department was created for america but it was disbanded in 1782 when the home office took responsibility10 plymouth massachusetts bay connecticut and new haven colonies formed the new england confederation in 1643 and all new england colonies were included in the dominion of new england 16861689 the province of carolina was initially chartered in 1629 and initial settlements were established after 1651 that charter was voided in 1660 by charles ii and a new charter was issued in 1663 making it a proprietary colony the carolina province was divided into separate proprietary colonies north and south in 1712 before both became royal colonies in 1729 earlier along the coast the roanoke colony was established in 1585 reestablished in 1587 and found abandoned in 1590 the first british colony was jamestown established on may 14 1607 near chesapeake bay the business venture was financed and coordinated by the london virginia company a jointstock company looking for gold its first years were extremely difficult with very high death rates from disease and starvation wars with local indians and little gold the colony survived and flourished by turning to tobacco as a cash crop1112 in 1632 king charles i granted the charter for the province of maryland to cecil calvert 2nd baron baltimore calverts father had been a prominent catholic official who encouraged catholic immigration to the english colonies the charter offered no guidelines on religion13 the province of carolina was the second attempted english settlement south of virginia the first being the failed attempt at roanoke it was a private venture financed by a group of english lords proprietors who obtained a royal charter to the carolinas in 1663 hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like jamestown carolina was not settled until 1670 and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area eventually however the lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by sir john colleton the expedition located fertile and defensible ground at charleston originally charles town for charles ii of england14 beginning in 1609 dutch traders established fur trading posts on the hudson river delaware river and connecticut river seeking to protect their interests in the fur trade the dutch west india company established permanent settlements on the hudson river creating the dutch colony of new netherland15 in 1626 peter minuit purchased the island of manhattan from the lenape indians and established the outpost of new amsterdam relatively few dutch settled in new netherland but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade it also served as the base for extensive trade with the english colonies and many products from new england and virginia were carried to europe on dutch ships the dutch also engaged in the burgeoning atlantic slave trade bringing some enslaved africans to the english colonies in north america although many more were sent to barbados and brazil the west india company desired to grow new netherland as it became commercially successful yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the english colonies did many of those who did immigrate to the colony were english german walloon or sephardim16 in 1638 sweden established the colony of new sweden in the delaware valley the operation was led by former members of the dutch west india company including peter minuit new sweden established extensive trading contacts with english colonies to the south and shipped much of the tobacco produced in virginia the colony was conquered by the dutch in 1655 while sweden was engaged in the second northern war17 beginning in the 1650s the english and dutch engaged in a series of wars and the english sought to conquer new netherland richard nicolls captured the lightly defended new amsterdam in 1664 and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of new netherland the 1667 treaty of breda ended the second anglodutch war and confirmed english control of the region the dutch briefly regained control of parts of new netherland in the third anglodutch war but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 treaty of westminster ending the dutch colonial presence in america18 the british renamed the colony of new amsterdam to york city or new york large numbers of dutch remained in the colony dominating the rural areas between manhattan and albany while people from new england started moving in as well as immigrants from germany new york city attracted a large polyglot population including a large black slave population19 in 1674 the proprietary colonies of east jersey and west jersey were created from lands formerly part of new york20 pennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of quaker william penn the main population elements included the quaker population based in philadelphia a scotchirish population on the western frontier and numerous german colonies in between21 philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location excellent port and a population of about 3000022 the pilgrims were a small group of puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the church of england which they perceived as corrupted they initially moved to the netherlands but eventually sailed to america in 1620 on the mayflower upon their arrival they drew up the mayflower compact by which they bound themselves together as a united community thus establishing the small plymouth colony william bradford was their main leader after its founding other settlers traveled from england to join the colony23 more puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the massachusetts bay colony with 400 settlers they sought to reform the church of england by creating a new ideologically pure church in the new world by 1640 20000 had arrived many died soon after arrival but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply the plymouth and massachusetts bay colonies together spawned other puritan colonies in new england including the new haven saybrook and connecticut colonies during the 17th century the new haven and saybrook colonies were absorbed by connecticut24 roger williams established providence plantations in 1636 on land provided by narragansett sachem canonicus williams was a puritan who preached religious tolerance separation of church and state and a complete break with the church of england he was banished from the massachusetts bay colony over theological disagreements he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule in civil things and liberty of conscience in religious matters2526 in 1637 a second group including anne hutchinson established a second settlement on rhode island today called aquidneck samuel gorton and others established a settlement near providence plantations which they called shawomet however massachusetts bay attempted to seize the land and put it under their own authority so gorton travelled to london to gain a charter from the king robert rich 2nd earl of warwick assisted him in gaining the charter so he changed the name of the settlement to warwick roger williams secured a royal charter from the king in 1663 which united all four settlements into the colony of rhode island and providence plantations other colonists settled to the north mingling with adventurers and profitoriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in new hampshire and maine massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s but new hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679 maine remained a part of massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820 in 1685 king james ii of england closed the legislatures and consolidated the new england colonies into the dominion of new england putting the region under the control of governor edmund andros in 1688 the colonies of new york west jersey and east jersey were added to the dominion andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689 after the glorious revolution deposed king james ii the former colonies were reestablished27 according to guy miller the rebellion of 1689 was the climax of the 60yearold struggle between the government in england and the puritans of massachusetts over the question of who was to rule the bay colony28 in 1702 east and west jersey were combined to form the province of new jersey the northern and southern sections of the carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691 when philip ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province from that time until 1708 the northern and southern settlements remained under one government however during this period the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as north carolina and south carolina as the descendants of the colonys proprietors fought over the direction of the colony29 the colonists of charles town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government this marked the start of separate governments in the province of northcarolina and the province of south carolina in 1729 the king formally revoked carolinas colonial charter and established both north carolina and south carolina as crown colonies30 in the 1730s parliamentarian james oglethorpe proposed that the area south of the carolinas be colonized with the worthy poor of england to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors prisons oglethorpe and other english philanthropists secured a royal charter as the trustees of the colony of georgia on june 9 173231 oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated the proprietors gave up their charter in 1752 at which point georgia became a crown colony32 the population of the thirteen colonies grew immensely in the 18th century according to historian alan taylor the population was 15 million in 1750 which represented fourfifths of the population of british north america33 more than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers though some seaports also flourished in 1760 the cities of philadelphia new york and boston had a population of more than 16000 which was small by european standards34 by 1770 the economic output of the thirteen colonies made up forty percent of the gross domestic product of the entire british empire35 as the 18th century progressed colonists began to settle far from the atlantic coast pennsylvania virginia connecticut and maryland all laid claim to the land in the ohio river valley the colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from indian tribes as the british insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases36 virginia was particularly intent on western expansion and most of the elite virginia families invested in the ohio company to promote the settlement of the ohio country37 the british american colonies became part of the global british trading network as the value tripled for exports from america to britain between 1700 and 1754 the colonists were restricted in trading with other european powers but they found profitable trade partners in the other british colonies particularly in the caribbean the colonists traded foodstuffs wood tobacco and various other resources for asian tea west indian coffee and west indian sugar among other items american indians far from the atlantic coast supplied the atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins america had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry and many american merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade38 improved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor particularly in the south the population of slaves in america grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750 and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves slaves supported vast plantation economies in the south while slaves in the north worked in a variety of occupations there were a few local attempted slave revolts such as the stono rebellion and the new york conspiracy of 1741 but these uprisings were suppressed39 a small proportion of the english population migrated to america after 1700 but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other european countries these immigrants traveled to all of the colonies but the middle colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies40 numerous settlers immigrated from ireland41 both catholic and protestantparticularly new light ulster presbyterians42 protestant germans also immigrated in large numbers particularly to pennsylvania43 in the 1740s the thirteen colonies underwent the first great awakening44 in 1738 an incident involving a welsh mariner named robert jenkins sparked the war of jenkins ear between britain and spain hundreds of north americans volunteered for admiral edward vernons assault on cartagena de indias a spanish city in south america45 the war against spain merged into a broader conflict known as the war of the austrian succession but most colonists called it king georges war46 in 1745 british and colonial forces captured the town of louisbourg and the war came to an end with the 1748 treaty of aixlachapelle however many colonists were angered when britain returned louisbourg to france in return for madras and other territories47 in the aftermath of the war both the british and french sought to expand into the ohio river valley48 the french and indian war 17541763 was the american extension of the general european conflict known as the seven years war previous colonial wars in north america had started in europe and then spread to the colonies but the french and indian war is notable for having started in north america and spread to europe one of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between britain and france especially in the great lakes and ohio valley49 the french and indian war took on a new significance for the british north american colonists when william pitt the elder decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to north america in order to win the war against france for the first time the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a world war during the war it became increasingly apparent to american colonists that they were under the authority of the british empire as british military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives the war also increased a sense of american unity in other ways it caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still american throughout the course of the war british officers trained americans for battle most notably george washington which benefited the american cause during the revolution also colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continentwide military effort49 the relations were not always positive between the british military establishment and the colonists setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of british troops at the 1754 albany congress pennsylvania colonist benjamin franklin proposed the albany plan which would have created a unified government of the thirteen colonies for coordination of defense and other matters but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies50 in the treaty of paris 1763 france formally ceded to britain the eastern part of its vast north american empire having secretly given to spain the territory of louisiana west of the mississippi river the previous year before the war britain held the thirteen american colonies most of presentday nova scotia and most of the hudson bay watershed following the war britain gained all french territory east of the mississippi river including quebec the great lakes and the ohio river valley britain also gained spanish florida from which it formed the colonies of east and west florida in removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies the war also largely removed the colonists need for colonial protection the british and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe the colonists loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before however disunity was beginning to form british prime minister william pitt the elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from britain itself this was a successful wartime strategy but after the war was over each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other the british elite the most heavily taxed of any in europe pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers the colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served european interests more than their own this dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the american revolution49 the british were left with large debts following the french and indian war so british leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the thirteen colonies51 they imposed several new taxes beginning with the sugar act 1764 later acts included the currency act 1764 the stamp act 1765 and the townshend acts of 176752 colonial newspapers and printers in particular took strong exception against the stamp act which imposed a tax on newspapers and official documents and played a central role in disseminating literature among the colonists against such taxes and the idea of taxation without colonial representation53 the royal proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the appalachian mountains as this was designated an indian reserve54 some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation however and continued to move west and establish farms55 the proclamation was modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation56 parliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies bypassing the colonial legislatures and americans began to insist on the principle of no taxation without representation with intense protests over the stamp act of 176557 they argued that the colonies had no representation in the british parliament so it was a violation of their rights as englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes colonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 tea act which reduced taxes on tea sold by the east india company in an effort to undercut the competition and prime minister norths ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting british taxation policies trouble escalated over the tea tax as americans in each colony boycotted the tea and those in boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the boston tea party in 1773 when the sons of liberty dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water tensions escalated in 1774 as parliament passed the laws known as the intolerable acts which greatly restricted selfgovernment in the colony of massachusetts these laws also allowed british military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers regardless of whether the american civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes the laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials forcing such trials to be held in england rather than in america parliament also sent thomas gage to serve as governor of massachusetts and as the commander of british forces in north america58 by 1774 colonists still hoped to remain part of the british empire but discontentment was widespread concerning british rule throughout the thirteen colonies59 colonists elected delegates to the first continental congress which convened in philadelphia in september 1774 in the aftermath of the intolerable acts the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king they would accept royal governors as agents of the king but they were no longer willing to recognize parliaments right to pass legislation affecting the colonies most delegates opposed an attack on the british position in boston and the continental congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the continental association the boycott proved effective and the value of british imports dropped dramatically60 the thirteen colonies became increasingly divided between patriots opposed to british rule and loyalists who supported it61 in response the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as provincial congresses and colonists began to boycott imported british merchandise62 later in 1774 12 colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress in philadelphia during the second continental congress the remaining colony of georgia sent delegates as well massachusetts governor thomas gage feared a confrontation with the colonists he requested reinforcements from britain but the british government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the thirteen colonies gage was instead ordered to seize patriot arsenals he dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at concord massachusetts but the patriots learned about it and blocked their advance the patriots repulsed the british force at the april 1775 battles of lexington and concord then lay siege to boston63 by spring 1775 all royal officials had been expelled and the continental congress hosted a convention of delegates for the thirteen colonies it raised an army to fight the british and named george washington its commander made treaties declared independence and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states64 later enumerated in the 1777 articles of confederationc in may 1775 the second continental congress assembled in the revolutionary capital of philadelphia began recruiting soldiers for the revolutionary war against the british printing its own money and appointing george washington as commander of patriot militias those from new england that had launched the siege of boston which forced british troops to withdraw from boston the patriot militias later were formalized into the continental army under washingtons command the second continental congress charged the committee of five including john adams benjamin franklin thomas jefferson robert r livingston and roger sherman with authoring the declaration of independence the committee in turn asked jefferson to author the first draft which jefferson largely wrote in isolation between june 11 1776 and june 28 1776 from the second floor of a threestory home he was renting at 700 market street in philadelphia now called the declaration house and within walking distance of independence hall65 considering congresss busy schedule jefferson probably had limited time for writing over these 17 days and he likely wrote his first draft quickly 104 on july 4 1776 the second continental congress unanimously adopted and issued the declaration as a letter of grievances to king george iii with the help chiefly of france they defeated the british in the american revolutionary war the decisive victory came at the siege of yorktown in 1781 in the treaty of paris 1783 britain officially recognized the independence of the united states of america6667 the colonial population rose to a quarter of a million during the 17th century and to nearly 25 million on the eve of the american revolution the estimates do not include the indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies good health was important for the growth of the colonies fewer deaths among the young meant that a higher proportion of the population reached reproductive age and that fact alone helps to explain why the colonies grew so rapidly69 there were many other reasons for the population growth besides good health such as the great migrationdubious discuss by 1776 about 85 of the white populations ancestry originated in the british isles english scotsirish scottish welsh 9 of german origin 4 dutch and 2 huguenot french and other minorities over 90 were farmers with several small cities that were also seaports linking the colonial economy to the larger british empire these populations continued to grow at a rapid rate during the late 18th and early 19th centuries primarily because of high birth rates and relatively low death rates immigration was a minor factor from 1774 to 183070 according to the united states historical census data base ushcdb the ethnic populations in the british american colonies of 1700 1755 and 1775 were chattel slavery was legal and practiced in all of the thirteen colonies74 in most places it involved house servants or farm workers it was of economic importance in the exportoriented tobacco plantations of virginia and maryland and on the rice and indigo plantations of south carolina75 about 287000 slaves were imported into the thirteen colonies over a period of 160 years or 2 of the estimated 12 million taken from africa to the americas via the atlantic slave trade the great majority went to sugar colonies in the caribbean and to brazil where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished by the mid18th century life expectancy was much higher in the american colonies76 the numbers grew rapidly through a very high birth rate and low mortality rate reaching nearly four million by the 1860 census from 1770 until 1860 the rate of natural growth of north american slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in europe and was nearly twice as rapid as that in england the legal status of chattel slavery has been explained by william m wiecek78 by the time of the revolution each of the mainland colonies had at least the rudiments of a statutory law of slaveryand nine of them had fairly elaborate slave codes that specified four basic legal characteristics of american slavery first the statutes defined slavery as a lifetime condition distinguishing it from servitude and other forms of unfree status which lasted only for a term of years secondslave status was made hereditable through the mother in so providing the american colonies reversed the commonlaw rule that personal status followed the condition of the father the third fundamental statutory characteristic of american slavery was racial identificationthe fourth and most troublesome of the elements of slavery for colonial legislators was the precise legal status of a slave as property southern jurisdictions settled on the legal definition of a slave as a chattel personal the diseases that afflicted the early immigrant settlers was a dangerous threat to life some of the diseases were new and treatments were ineffective malaria was deadly to many new arrivals especially in the southern colonies of newly arrived ablebodied young men over onefourth of the anglican missionaries died within five years of their arrival in the carolinas79 mortality was high for infants and small children especially for diphtheria smallpox yellow fever and malaria most sick people turned to local healers and used folk remedies others relied upon the ministerphysicians barbersurgeons apothecaries midwives and ministers a few used colonial physicians trained either in britain or an apprenticeship in the colonies one common treatment was blood letting the method was crude due to a lack of knowledge about germs and infection among medical practitioners there was little government control regulation of medical care or attention to public health by the 18th century colonial physicians following the models in england and scotland introduced modern medicine to the cities in the 18th century and made some advances in vaccination pathology anatomy and pharmacology808182 according to patricia bonomi early americans in all sections lived not in a spiritual desert but in a world where religion formed a key component of their mental landscape83 protestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the thirteen colonies there were also a few catholics in maryland as well as jews and deists many colonists had no religious connection the church of england was officially established in most of the south the puritan movement divided into the congregational and the unitarian denominations and was the established religious affiliation in massachusetts and connecticut into the 19th century84 in practice this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses the anglican parishes in the south were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor after 1700 the vestry no longer dominated the minister8586 the colonies were religiously diverse with different protestant denominations brought by british german dutch and other immigrants the reformed tradition was the foundation for presbyterian congregationalist and continental reformed denominations french huguenots set up their own reformed congregations the dutch reformed church was strong among dutch americans in new york and new jersey while lutheranism was prevalent among german immigrants germans also brought diverse forms of anabaptism especially the mennonite variety reformed baptist preacher roger williams founded providence plantations which became the colony of rhode island and providence plantations jews were clustered in a few port cities the baltimore family founded maryland and brought in fellow catholics from england87 catholics were about 16 of the population or 40000 in 1775 of the 200250000 irish who came to the colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20000 were catholic many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination between 1770 and 1775 3900 irish catholics arrived out of almost 45000 white immigrants 7000 english 15000 scots 13200 scotsirish 5200 germans88 most catholics were english recusants germans irish or blacks half lived in maryland with large populations also in new york and pennsylvania presbyterians were chiefly immigrants from scotland and ulster who favored the backcountry and frontier districts89 quakers were well established in pennsylvania where they controlled the governorship and the legislature for many years90 quakers were also numerous in rhode island baptists and methodists were growing rapidly during the first great awakening of the 1740s91 many denominations sponsored missions to the local indians92 higher education was available for young men in the north and most students were aspiring protestant ministerscitation needed nine institutions of higher education were chartered during the colonial era these colleges known collectively as the colonial colleges were new college harvard the college of william mary yale college yale the college of new jersey princeton kings college columbia the college of philadelphia university of pennsylvania the college of rhode island brown queens college rutgers and dartmouth college the college of william mary and queens college later became public institutions while the other institutions account for seven of the eight private ivy league universities with the exception of the college of william and mary these institutions were all located in new england and the middle colonies the southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children mirroring the common belief in europe wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from britain or sent children to school in england by the 1700s university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors93 most new england towns sponsored public schools for boys but public schooling was rare elsewhere girls were educated at home or by small local private schools and they had no access to college aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner although some young men went to medical schools in scotland94 the three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial royal colony proprietary and charter these governments were all subordinate to the british monarch with no representation in the parliament of great britain the administration of all british colonies was overseen by the board of trade in london beginning late in the 17th century the provincial colony was governed by commissions created at the pleasure of the king a governor and his council were appointed by the crown the governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly the governors council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session in addition to its role in advising the governor assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters landowners of the province the governor had the power of absolute veto and could prorogue ie delay and dissolve the assembly the assemblys role was to make all local laws and ordinances ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of britain in practice this did not always occur since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown laws could be examined by the british privy council or board of trade which also held veto power of legislation new hampshire new york virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia were crown colonies massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century proprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king they were set up after the english restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty pennsylvania which included delaware new jersey and maryland were proprietary colonies95 charter governments were political corporations created by letters patent giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government the charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative executive and judicial functions with those powers being vested in officials massachusetts providence plantation rhode island warwick and connecticut were charter colonies the massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 169196 providence plantations merged with the settlements at rhode island and warwick to form the colony of rhode island and providence plantations which also became a charter colony in 1636 after 1680 the imperial government in london took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies which were growing rapidly in population and wealth in 1680 only virginia was a royal colony by 1720 half were under the control of royal governors these governors were appointees closely tied to the government in london historians before the 1880s emphasized american nationalism however scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the imperial school led by herbert l osgood george louis beer charles mclean andrews and lawrence h gipson this viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s and they emphasized and often praised the attention that london gave to all the colonies in this view there was never a threat before the 1770s that any colony would revolt or seek independence97 settlers did not come to the american colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system yet they quickly created a broad electorate the 13 colonies had no hereditary aristocrats as in europe there were no rich gentry who owned all the farmland and rented it out to tenants as in england and in the dutch settlements in upstate new york instead there was a political system of local control that was governed by men elected in fair elections the colonies offered a broader base than britain or indeed any other country any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature governors were appointed in london but colonists elected the governor in connecticut and rhode island98 women children indentured servants and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head and did not have a vote or a voice indians and free blacks were politically outside the system and usually could not vote voters were required to hold an interest in society as the south carolina legislature said in 1716 it is necessary and reasonable that none but such persons will have an interest in the province should be capable to elect members of the commons house of assembly99 the main legal criterion for having an interest was ownership of real estate in britain 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords london insisted on this requirement for the colonies telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholdersthat is those who did not own land however in most places good farmland was cheap and so widely owned that 50 to 80 of the men were eligible to vote100 according to historian donald radcliffe the right to vote had always been extraordinarily widespreadat least among adult white maleseven before the country gained its independenceenfranchisement varied greatly by location there certainly were communities particularly newly settled communities where land was inexpensive in which 70 or 80 percent of all white men were enfranchised yet there were also localeswhere the percentages were far lower closer to 40 or 50 percenton the whole the franchise was far more widespread than it was in england yet as the revolution approached the rate of property ownership was falling and the proportion of adult white males who were eligible to vote was probably less than 60 percent101 the colonial political culture emphasized deference so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen but sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes there were no political parties and wouldbe legislators formed ad hoc coalitions of their families friends and neighbors election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat or town center to make merry politick shake hands with the grandees meet old friends and hear the speechesall the while toasting eating treating tippling and gambling they voted by shouting their choice to the clerk as supporters cheered or booed in virginia candidate george washington spent 39 for treats for his supporters the candidates knew that they had to swill the planters with bumbo rum elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed102 voting was voluntary and typically about half the men eligible to vote turned out on election day turnout was usually higher in pennsylvania and new york where longstanding factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate new york and rhode island developed longlasting twofaction systems that held together for years at the colony level but they did not reach into local affairs the factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections and they had little basis in policy or ideology elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl based on personality rather than longlived factions or serious disputes on issues98 the colonies were independent of one other before 1774 indeed all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations further efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the albany congress of 1754 led by benjamin franklin the thirteen all had wellestablished systems of selfgovernment and elections based on the rights of englishmen which they were determined to protect from imperial interference103 the british empire at the time was operated under the mercantile system where all trade was concentrated inside the empire and trade with other empires was forbidden the goal was to enrich britainits merchants and its government whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in london but americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies104 mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth to the exclusion of other empires the government protected its merchantsand kept others outby trade barriers regulations and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm the government had to fight smugglingwhich became a favorite american technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the french spanish or dutch105 the tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses so that gold and silver would pour into london the government took its share through duties and taxes with the remainder going to merchants in britain the government spent much of its revenue on a superb royal navy which not only protected the british colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires and sometimes seized them thus the british navy captured new amsterdam new york in 1664 the colonies were captive markets for british industry and the goal was to enrich the mother country106 colonial commodities were shipped on british ships to the mother country where britain sold them to europe reaping the benefits of the export trade finished goods were manufactured in britain and sold in the colonies or imported by britain for retail to the colonies profiting the mother country like other new world colonial empires the british empires commodity production was dependent on slave labor as observed in 1720s britain all this great increase in our treasure proceeds chiefly from the labour of negroes in britains colonies107 britain implemented mercantilism by trying to block american trade with the french spanish or dutch empires using the navigation acts which americans avoided as often as they could the royal officials responded to smuggling with openended search warrants writs of assistance in 1761 boston lawyer james otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists he lost the case but john adams later wrote then and there the child independence was born108 however the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose british regulation of their external trade they only opposed legislation that affected them internally transportation was primarily done by water although a road network did exist in the colonies as transportation was often done by water a sizable shipbuilding industry developed especially in new england rivers were utilized for transportation purposes109 most roads existed along the atlantic coast and connected other cities to each other some individual colonies built their own road networks by 1764 a stagecoach route existed between philadelphia and new york city and by 1773 the stagecoach network extended to providence and boston109 besides the grouping that became known as the thirteen colonies110 britain in the late18th century had another dozen colonial possessions in the new world surrounding the 13 colonies the british west indies newfoundland the province of quebec nova scotia prince edward island bermuda and east and west florida remained loyal to the british crown throughout the war although spain reacquired florida as the war was ending and in 1821 sold it to the united states several of the other colonies evinced a certain degree of sympathy with the patriot cause but their geographical isolation and the dominance of british naval power precluded any effective participation111 the british crown had only recently acquired several of those lands and many of the issues facing the thirteen colonies did not apply to them especially in the case of quebec and florida112 the first british empire centered on the thirteen colonies which attracted large numbers of settlers from britain the imperial school in the 19001930s took a favorable view of the benefits of empire emphasizing its successful economic integration113 the imperial school included such historians as herbert l osgood george louis beer charles m andrews and lawrence gipson114 the shock of britains defeat in 1783 caused a radical revision of british policies on colonialism thereby producing what historians call the end of the first british empire even though britain still controlled canada and some islands in the west indies115 ashley jackson writes the first british empire was largely destroyed by the loss of the american colonies followed by a swing to the east and the foundation of a second british empire based on commercial and territorial expansion in south asia116 much of the historiography concerns the reasons why the americans rebelled in the 1770s and successfully broke away since the 1960s the mainstream of historiography has emphasized the growth of american consciousness and nationalism and the colonial republican valuesystem in opposition to the aristocratic viewpoint of british leaders117 historians in recent decades have mostly used one of three approaches to analyze the american revolution118
