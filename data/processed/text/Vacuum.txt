a vacuum pl vacuums or vacua is space devoid of matter the word is derived from the latin adjective vacuus neuter vacuum meaning vacant or void an approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure1 physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum which they sometimes simply call vacuum or free space and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space in engineering and applied physics on the other hand vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is considerably lower than atmospheric pressure2 the latin term in vacuo is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum the quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum other things equal lower gas pressure means higherquality vacuum for example a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure by around 203 but higherquality vacuums are possible ultrahigh vacuum chambers common in chemistry physics and engineering operate below one trillionth 1012 of atmospheric pressure 100 npa and can reach around 100 particlescm34 outer space is an even higherquality vacuum with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average in intergalactic space5 vacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient greek times but was not studied empirically until the 17th century clemens timpler 1605 philosophized about the experimental possibility of producing a vacuum in small tubes6 evangelista torricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643 and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure a torricellian vacuum is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container closed at one end and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury see below7 vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes and a wide array of vacuum technologies has since become available the development of human spaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health and on life forms in general the word vacuum comes from latin an empty space void noun use of neuter of vacuus meaning empty related to vacare meaning to be empty vacuum is one of the few words in the english language that contains two consecutive instances of the vowel u8 historically there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist ancient greek philosophers debated the existence of a vacuum or void in the context of atomism which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics lucretius argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century bc and hero of alexandria tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century ad9 following plato however even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism it could not be apprehended by the senses it could not itself provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and by definition it was quite literally nothing at all which cannot rightly be said to exist aristotle believed that no void could occur naturally because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void in his physics book iv aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void for example that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular in the medieval muslim world the physicist and islamic scholar alfarabi wrote a treatise rejecting the existence of the vacuum in the 10th century10 he concluded that airs volume can expand to fill available space and therefore the concept of a perfect vacuum was incoherent11 according to ahmad dallal ab rayhn albrn states that there is no observable evidence that rules out the possibility of vacuum12 the suction pump was described by arab engineer aljazari in the 13th century and later appeared in europe from the 15th century1314 european scholars such as roger bacon blasius of parma and walter burley in the 13th and 14th century focused considerable attention on issues concerning the concept of a vacuum the commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called horror vacui there was even speculation that even god could not create a vacuum if he wanted and the 1277 paris condemnations of bishop tienne tempier which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of god led to the conclusion that god could create a vacuum if he so wished15 from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the aristotelian perspective scholars widely acknowledged that a supernatural void exists beyond the confines of the cosmos itself by the 17th century this idea influenced by stoic physics helped to segregate natural and theological concerns16 almost two thousand years after plato ren descartes also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism without the problematic nothingeverything dichotomy of void and atom although descartes agreed with the contemporary position that a vacuum does not occur in nature the success of his namesake coordinate system and more implicitly the spatialcorporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume by the ancient definition however directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinctcitation needed medieval thought experiments into the idea of a vacuum considered whether a vacuum was present if only for an instant between two flat plates when they were rapidly separated17 there was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated or as walter burley postulated whether a celestial agent prevented the vacuum arising jean buridan reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open bellows when the port was sealed9 the 17th century saw the first attempts to quantify measurements of partial vacuum18 evangelista torricellis mercury barometer of 1643 and blaise pascals experiments both demonstrated a partial vacuum in 1654 otto von guericke invented the first vacuum pump19 and conducted his famous magdeburg hemispheres experiment showing that owing to atmospheric pressure outside the hemispheres teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated robert boyle improved guerickes design and with the help of robert hooke further developed vacuum pump technology thereafter research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when august toepler invented the toepler pump and in 1855 when heinrich geissler invented the mercury displacement pump achieving a partial vacuum of about 10 pa 01 torr a number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level which renewed interest in further research while outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called aether borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of stoic physics aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name see aether mythology early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated additionally the concept informed isaac newtons explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat20 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect a minute drag on the earths orbit while the earth does in fact move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected in 1912 astronomer henry pickering commented while the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether it is characteristic of a gas and free gaseous molecules are certainly there21 thereafter however luminiferous aether was discarded later in 1930 paul dirac proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy called the dirac sea this theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated dirac equation and successfully predicted the existence of the positron confirmed two years later werner heisenbergs uncertainty principle formulated in 1927 predicted a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and momentum or energy and time can be measured this far reaching consequences also threatened whether the emptiness of space between particles exists the strictest criterion to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the stressenergy tensor are zero this means that this region is devoid of energy and momentum and by consequence it must be empty of particles and other physical fields such as electromagnetism that contain energy and momentum in general relativity a vanishing stressenergy tensor implies through einstein field equations the vanishing of all the components of the ricci tensor vacuum does not mean that the curvature of spacetime is necessarily flat the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and gravitational waves technically these phenomena are the components of the weyl tensor the black hole with zero electric charge is an elegant example of a region completely filled with vacuum but still showing a strong curvature in classical electromagnetism the vacuum of free space or sometimes just free space or perfect vacuum is a standard reference medium for electromagnetic effects2223 some authors refer to this reference medium as classical vacuum22 a terminology intended to separate this concept from qed vacuum or qcd vacuum where vacuum fluctuations can produce transient virtual particle densities and a relative permittivity and relative permeability that are not identically unity242526 in the theory of classical electromagnetism free space has the following properties the vacuum of classical electromagnetism can be viewed as an idealized electromagnetic medium with the constitutive relations in si units32 relating the electric displacement field d to the electric field e and the magnetic field or hfield h to the magnetic induction or bfield b here r is a spatial location and t is time in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the vacuum is defined as the state that is the solution to the equations of the theory with the lowest possible energy the ground state of the hilbert space in quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as qed vacuum to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics denoted as qcd vacuum qed vacuum is a state with no matter particles hence the name and no photons as described above this state is impossible to achieve experimentally even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume it would be impossible to eliminate all the blackbody photons nonetheless it provides a good model for realizable vacuum and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next qed vacuum has interesting and complex properties in qed vacuum the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values but their variances are not zero33 as a result qed vacuum contains vacuum fluctuations virtual particles that hop into and out of existence and a finite energy called vacuum energy vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include spontaneous emission and the lamb shift15 coulombs law and the electric potential in vacuum near an electric charge are modified34 theoretically in qcd multiple vacuum states can coexist35 the starting and ending of cosmological inflation is thought to have arisen from transitions between different vacuum states for theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory each stationary point of the energy in the configuration space gives rise to a single vacuum string theory is believed to have a huge number of vacua the socalled string theory landscape outer space has very low density and pressure and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum but no vacuum is truly perfect not even in interstellar space where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter5 stars planets and moons keep their atmospheres by gravitational attraction and as such atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object the earths atmospheric pressure drops to about 32 millipascals 46106 psi at 100 kilometres 62 mi of altitude36 the krmn line which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space beyond this line isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar winds so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure temperature and composition and varies greatly due to space weather astrophysicists prefer to use number density to describe these environments in units of particles per cubic centimetre but although it meets the definition of outer space the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the krmn line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites most artificial satellites operate in this region called low earth orbit and must fire their engines every couple of weeks or a few times a year depending on solar activity37 the drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on solar sails a proposed propulsion system for interplanetary travel38 all of the observable universe is filled with large numbers of photons the socalled cosmic background radiation and quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos the current temperature of this radiation is about 3 k 27015 c 45427 f the quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it vacuum is primarily measured by its absolute pressure but a complete characterization requires further parameters such as temperature and chemical composition one of the most important parameters is the mean free path mfp of residual gases which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other as the gas density decreases the mfp increases and when the mfp is longer than the chamber pump spacecraft or other objects present the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply this vacuum state is called high vacuum and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics the mfp of air at atmospheric pressure is very short 70 nm but at 100 mpa 103 torr the mfp of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes the crookes radiometer turns when the mfp is larger than the size of the vanes vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it these ranges were defined in iso 352912019 as shown in the following table 100 pa corresponds to 075 torr torr is a nonsi unit vacuum is measured in units of pressure typically as a subtraction relative to ambient atmospheric pressure on earth but the amount of relative measurable vacuum varies with local conditions on the surface of venus where groundlevel atmospheric pressure is much higher than on earth much higher relative vacuum readings would be possible on the surface of the moon with almost no atmosphere it would be extremely difficult to create a measurable vacuum relative to the local environment similarly much higher than normal relative vacuum readings are possible deep in the earths ocean a submarine maintaining an internal pressure of 1 atmosphere submerged to a depth of 10 atmospheres 98 metres a 98metre column of seawater has the equivalent weight of 1 atm is effectively a vacuum chamber keeping out the crushing exterior water pressures though the 1 atm inside the submarine would not normally be considered a vacuum therefore to properly understand the following discussions of vacuum measurement it is important that the reader assumes the relative measurements are being done on earth at sea level at exactly 1 atmosphere of ambient atmospheric pressure the si unit of pressure is the pascal symbol pa but vacuum is often measured in torrs named for an italian physicist torricelli 16081647 a torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury mmhg in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 1333223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure vacuum is often also measured on the barometric scale or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury mmhg or pascals pa below standard atmospheric pressure below atmospheric means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure in other words most low vacuum gauges that read for example 5079 torr many inexpensive low vacuum gauges have a margin of error and may report a vacuum of 0 torr but in practice this generally requires a twostage rotary vane or other medium type of vacuum pump to go much beyond lower than 1 torr many devices are used to measure the pressure in a vacuum depending on what range of vacuum is needed39 hydrostatic gauges such as the mercury column manometer consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures the column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube the simplest design is a closedend ushaped tube one side of which is connected to the region of interest any fluid can be used but mercury is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1 torr 100 pa to above atmospheric an important variation is the mcleod gauge which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column the mcleod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 106 torr 01 mpa which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures but only indirectly by measurement of other pressurecontrolled properties these indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement most commonly a mcleod gauge40 the kenotometer is a particular type of hydrostatic gauge typically used in power plants using steam turbines the kenotometer measures the vacuum in the steam space of the condenser that is the exhaust of the last stage of the turbine41 mechanical or elastic gauges depend on a bourdon tube diaphragm or capsule usually made of metal which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question a variation on this idea is the capacitance manometer in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor a change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm which results in a change in capacitance these gauges are effective from 103 torr to 104 torr and beyond thermal conductivity gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure in this type of gauge a wire filament is heated by running current through it a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector rtd can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament this temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas and therefore on the thermal conductivity a common variant is the pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and rtd these gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 103 torr but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured ionization gauges are used in ultrahigh vacuum they come in two types hot cathode and cold cathode in the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam the electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them the resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode the current depends on the number of ions which depends on the pressure in the gauge hot cathode gauges are accurate from 103 torr to 1010 torr the principle behind cold cathode version is the same except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge cold cathode gauges are accurate from 102 torr to 109 torr ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry chemical composition of gases being measured corrosion and surface deposits their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum the composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement42 vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices its first widespread use was in the incandescent light bulb to protect the filament from chemical degradation the chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for electron beam welding cold welding vacuum packing and vacuum frying ultrahigh vacuum is used in the study of atomically clean substrates as only a very good vacuum preserves atomicscale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time on the order of minutes to days high to ultrahigh vacuum removes the obstruction of air allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination this is the principle behind chemical vapor deposition physical vapor deposition and dry etching which are essential to the fabrication of semiconductors and optical coatings and to surface science the reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of thermos bottles deep vacuum lowers the boiling point of liquids and promotes low temperature outgassing which is used in freeze drying adhesive preparation distillation metallurgy and process purging the electrical properties of vacuum make electron microscopes and vacuum tubes possible including cathoderay tubes vacuum interrupters are used in electrical switchgear vacuum arc processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials the elimination of air friction is useful for flywheel energy storage and ultracentrifuges vacuums are commonly used to produce suction which has an even wider variety of applications the newcomen steam engine used vacuum instead of pressure to drive a piston in the 19th century vacuum was used for traction on isambard kingdom brunels experimental atmospheric railway vacuum brakes were once widely used on trains in the uk but except on heritage railways they have been replaced by air brakes manifold vacuum can be used to drive accessories on automobiles the best known application is the vacuum servo used to provide power assistance for the brakes obsolete applications include vacuumdriven windscreen wipers and autovac fuel pumps some aircraft instruments attitude indicator ai and the heading indicator hi are typically vacuumpowered as protection against loss of all electrically powered instruments since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft the engine and an external venturi vacuum induction melting uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum maintaining a vacuum in the condenser is an important aspect of the efficient operation of steam turbines a steam jet ejector or liquid ring vacuum pump is used for this purpose the typical vacuum maintained in the condenser steam space at the exhaust of the turbine also called condenser backpressure is in the range 5 to 15 kpa absolute depending on the type of condenser and the ambient conditions evaporation and sublimation into a vacuum is called outgassing all materials solid or liquid have a small vapour pressure and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure outgassing has the same effect as a leak and will limit the achievable vacuum outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials this is of great concern to space missions where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission the most prevalent outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials it can be reduced by desiccating or baking the chamber and removing absorbent materials outgassed water can condense in the oil of rotary vane pumps and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used high vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing ultrahigh vacuum systems are usually baked preferably under vacuum to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials and boil them off once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual outgassing during actual operation some systems are cooled well below room temperature by liquid nitrogen to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously cryopump the system fluids cannot generally be pulled so a vacuum cannot be created by suction suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur the easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container for example the diaphragm muscle expands the chest cavity which causes the volume of the lungs to increase this expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure to continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off exhausted and expanded again this is the principle behind positive displacement pumps like the manual water pump for example inside the pump a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum because of the pressure differential some fluid from the chamber or the well in our example is pushed into the pumps small cavity the pumps cavity is then sealed from the chamber opened to the atmosphere and squeezed back to a minute size the above explanation is merely a simple introduction to vacuum pumping and is not representative of the entire range of pumps in use many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles momentum transfer pumps which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps entrapment pumps can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state often with no moving parts no seals and no vibration none of these pumps are universal each type has important performance limitations they all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases especially hydrogen helium and neon the lowest pressure that can be attained in a system is also dependent on many things other than the nature of the pumps multiple pumps may be connected in series called stages to achieve higher vacuums the choice of seals chamber geometry materials and pumpdown procedures will all have an impact collectively these are called vacuum technique and sometimes the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic pumping systems differ in oil contamination vibration preferential pumping of certain gases pumpdown speeds intermittent duty cycle reliability or tolerance to high leakage rates in ultra high vacuum systems some very odd leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered the water absorption of aluminium and palladium becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or titanium must be considered some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums the permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face the lowest pressures currently achievable in laboratory are about 11013 torrs 13 ppa43 however pressures as low as 51017 torrs 67 fpa have been indirectly measured in a 4 k 26915 c 45247 f cryogenic vacuum system4 this corresponds to 100 particlescm3 humans and animals exposed to vacuum will lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture the reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 c44 although the blood will not boil the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures known as ebullism is still a concern the gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture45 swelling and ebullism can be restrained by containment in a flight suit shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the crew altitude protection suit caps which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa 15 torr46 rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost particularly in the mouth but this is not a significant hazard animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds while longer fullbody exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful47 a study by nasa on eight chimpanzees found all of them survived two and a half minute exposures to vacuum48 there is only a limited amount of data available from human accidents but it is consistent with animal data limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired49 robert boyle was the first to show in 1660 that vacuum is lethal to small animals an experiment indicates that plants are able to survive in a low pressure environment 15 kpa for about 30 minutes5051 cold or oxygenrich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sealevel atmosphere the colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there49 above this altitude oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent altitude sickness in humans that did not undergo prior acclimatization and spacesuits are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km49 most spacesuits use only 20 kpa 150 torr of pure oxygen this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism but decompression sickness and gas embolisms can still occur if decompression rates are not managed rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself even if the victim does not hold his or her breath venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs49 eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression soft tissues may bruise and seep blood and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia52 injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma a pressure drop of 13 kpa 100 torr which produces no symptoms if it is gradual may be fatal if it occurs suddenly49 some extremophile microorganisms such as tardigrades can survive vacuum conditions for periods of days or weeks53
