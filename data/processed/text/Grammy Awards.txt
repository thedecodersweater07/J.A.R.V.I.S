tenyear broadcast deal between the recording academy and the walt disney company45 midnights cowboy carter the grammys had their origin in the hollywood walk of fame project in the 1950s67 as recording executives on the walk of fame committee compiled a list of significant recording industry people who might qualify for a walk of fame star they realized that many leading people in their business would not earn a star on hollywood boulevard they determined to rectify this by creating awards given by their industry similar to the oscars and the emmys after deciding to go forward with such awards a question remained what to call them one working title was the eddie to honor thomas edison the inventor of the phonograph eventually the name was chosen after a mailin contest whereby approximately 300 contestants submitted the name grammy with the earliest postmark from contest winner jay danna of new orleans louisiana as an abbreviated reference to emile berliners invention the

were added to the general field other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres and for other contributions such as artwork and video special awards are also given for longerlasting contributions to the music industry because of the large number of award categories 94 as of 2024 and a desire to feature several performances by various artists only awards with the most popular interest typically about 10 to 12 including the four general field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres ie pop rock country and rap are presented directly at the televised award ceremony most other grammy trophies are presented in a pretelecast premiere ceremony in the afternoon before the grammy awards telecast on april 6 2011 the recording academy announced a significant overhaul of many grammy award categories for 201230 the number of categories was cut from 109 to 78 the most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duogroups in various genre fields pop rock rhythm and blues rb country and rap additionally several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued recordings in these categories now fall under general categories for best solo performances in the rock field the hard rock and metal album categories were combined the best rock instrumental performance category was also eliminated31 in rb the distinction between best contemporary rb album and other rb albums has been eliminated consolidated into one best rb album category32 in rap the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new best rap performance category the roots category had the most eliminations up through 2011 there were separate categories for regional american music forms such as hawaiian native american and zydecocajun music a consistently low number of entries in these categories led the recording academy to combine these music variations into a new best regional roots music album including polka which had lost its category in 20093334 in samegenre fields the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre due to the number of entries and the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary and traditional blues and folk songs in the world music field the traditional and contemporary categories also were mergedcitation needed in the classical field several categories including its main category best classical album were trimmed down from eleven to seven distinct categories plus two classically focused production prizes classical recordings since then became eligible for the main album of the year category35 a few minor name changes were also made to better reflect the nature of the separate categories the recording academy determined that the word gospel in the gospel genre field tends to connote images and sounds of traditional soul gospel to the exclusion of contemporary christian music ccm therefore the field and some categories were renamed as gospelcontemporary christian music36 since 2012 small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields the number of categories has risen from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 201737 in 2020 amid the george floyd protests several urban rap and latin music categories were renamed38 in 2022 the number of awards was increased from 86 to 9139 performance categories were added for the americana and alternative music genres alongside new categories for video game score and spoken word poetry albums a songwriter category nonclassical and a song for social change category were also added and several categories were adjusted slightly4041 in 2023 several key changes were announced for the 66th annual grammy awards set to take place in 2024 three new categories were announced bringing the total number to 94 the highest since the peak of 109 in 2010 in addition both producer of the year nonclassical and songwriter of the year nonclassical were moved to the general field the first time new categories had been added to this field since the concept of the big four was established42 the total number of fields was consolidated from 26 to 11 to ensure that all voting members would be able to exercise their allocated ten genre votes as some members were prevented from doing so previously due to some fields only containing one category43 the national academy of recording arts and sciences has announced the date for the 68th grammy awards the organizers also introduced two new categories best traditional country album and best album cover members of the national academy of recording arts and sciences naras both media companies and individuals may nominate recordings for consideration entries are made and submitted online when a work is entered review sessions are held that involve over 150

nominate in the general fields record of the year album of the year song of the year and best new artist and in up to nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots the five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees while in some categories craft and specialized categories review committees determine the final five nominees44 there may be over five nominees if a tie occurs in the nomination process although members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences generally are invited to screenings or are sent dvds of films nominated for oscars naras members do not receive nominated recordings but instead receive access to a private online listening service after nominees have been determined final voting ballots are sent to naras voting members who may then vote in the general field and cast ten votes in various genre categories spread to three of the eleven fields members are encouraged but not required to vote only in their fields of expertise ballots are tabulated secretly by the independent accounting firm deloitte touche tohmatsu44 after vote tabulation winners are announced at the grammy awards the recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie in which case the two or more nominees who tie are considered winners winners are presented with a grammy award those who do not win receive a medal for their nominationcitation needed in both voting rounds academy members are required to vote solely based on quality without consideration for sales chart performance personal friendships regional preferences or company loyalty gifts may not be accepted members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the academy and their member community although registered media companies may submit entries they have no votecitation needed in many categories certificates are presented to those ineligible for a grammy award but who did contribute to a winning recording these certificates are known as participation certificates or winners certificates those eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks after the grammy ceremony45 a special grammy award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field46 it has come to be known as the grammy legend award and the grammy living legend award at different ceremonies as of 2018update fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award the grammy salute to industry icons award honors those who have made innovative contributions to the music industry474849 recipients include with 35 grammy awards beyonc is the artist with the most grammy wins5051 u2 with 22 grammy awards holds the record for most awards won by a group52 when pearl jam won a grammy for the best hard rock performance in 1996 the bands lead singer eddie vedder commented on stage i dont know what this means i dont think it means anything53 in 2008 glen hansard leader of the irish rock group the frames stated that the grammys represent something outside of the real world of music thats fully industry based he said he was not particularly interested in attending that years ceremony even though he had been nominated for two awards54 maynard james keenan lead singer of progressive rock band tool did not attend the grammy awards ceremony to receive one of the bands awards explaining that55 i think the grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry they cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses they dont honor the arts or the artist for what he created its the music business celebrating itself thats basically what its all about the grammys have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful ones5657 in 1991 sinad oconnor became the first musician to refuse a grammy boycotting the ceremony after being nominated for record of the year best female pop vocal performance and grammy award for best alternative music performance oconnor would go on to win the latter award58 she said her reasoning came from the grammys extreme commercialism59 in 2024 rhiannon giddens described the financial strain of attending the ceremony for middle and working class musicians she criticized the recording academy for introducing a policy of charging nominees 1200 for a plus one saying the policy makes it ever more obvious who is valued and more specifically what that would be lots of money for the folks in the back a billboard article clarified that the new policy was a tiered system ranging from 375 to 2000 for a ticket to attend the pretelecast ceremony60 the grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists the organizations awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by voting members of the recording academy and that voting members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process such as performers songwriters producers and engineers61 nomination review committees composed of anonymous industry figures were established following the 37th grammy awards which attracted criticism for the slate of album of the year nominations6263 the winner tony bennetts live album mtv unplugged competed against the live classical album the three tenors in concert 1994 seals second eponymous album and the twelfth albums from bonnie raitt and eric clapton both longtime musical mainstays not nominated that year were several albums that would later be recognized as classics including nass debut album illmatic oasiss debut album definitely maybe holes album live through this jeff buckleys grace and the debut album from wutang clan the nomination review committees would be disbanded in 2021 following criticism of the lack of nominations for the weeknds album after hours64 at the 38th annual grammy awards artist mariah carey was nominated for six awards for her album daydream including album of the year and record of the year for her single one sweet day although critics believed carey would be cleaning up that year carey ultimately lost in all her nominated categories that night much to the shock of critics and carey herself65 in 2011 los angeles times journalist randall roberts criticized the exclusion of kanye wests my beautiful dark twisted fantasy from album of the year nominations for the 54th grammy awards he described wests album as the most critically acclaimed album of the year a careerdefining record66 roberts went on to criticize the grammy awards for being mired in the past and out of touch with new media and trends among music listeners such as music sharing stating66 the major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be allinclusive but more significantly they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general populationthe focus is still on the old music industry model of cashcow hits major label investments and commercial radio in an article for time journalist tour also responded to the snub and expressed general displeasure with the awards stating i dont pretend to understand the grammys i have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues i comprehend the particular logic of the oscars but not the big awards for music my normal state of confusion around what drives grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when to the shock of many kanyes masterpiece my beautiful dark twisted fantasy was not nominated for a grammy for album of the year67 he went on to compare understanding the grammy awards to kremlinology and commented on the recording academys exclusion of more mature hip hop albums as album of the year nominees noting that it occasionally opts to nominate popfriendly hip hop albums instead67 in a 2011 profile for the new york times after the 53rd grammy awards frontman justin vernon of indie band bon iver was asked about the grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group to which he responded68 you know i was thinking about that a couple of months ago someone asked me that and i was like i would go and i would and i dont think the bon iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a grammy i would get up there and be like this is for my parents because they supported me because i know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there but i kinda felt like going up there and being like everyone should go home this is ridiculous you should not be doing this we should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important thats what i would say he reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the grammys saying68 ninetyeight percent of the people in that room their art is compromised by the fact that theyre thinking that and that theyre hoping to get that award and who is that award given by its like they think its literally handed down by the musicalhistory gods and i dont know who the voters are like i have a friend whos a voter who was like i had to be a voter because i dont trust the other voters and i was like me either and its just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it bon iver subsequently received four nominations in november for the 54th grammy awards68 after winning vernon said in his acceptance its really hard to accept this award theres so much talent out here and theres a lot of talent thats not here tonight its also hard to accept because you know when i started to make songs i did it for the inherent reward of making songs so im a little bit uncomfortable up here69 in his article everything old is praised again jon caramanica of the new york times criticized grammy voters for being conservative and disregarding more forwardlooking music and wrote in response to the 54th grammy awards for the umpteenth time the grammys went with familiarity over risk bestowing album of the year honors and several more on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change70 he cited the grammy successes of lauryn hills the miseducation of lauryn hill 1998 norah jones come away with me 2003 and adeles 21 2011 as examples of the grammys dropping a boatload of awards on a young female singersongwriter and her breakthrough album of kanye wests absence from the ceremony caramanica stated he didnt even bother to show up for the broadcast which was well enough because hiphop was almost completely marginalized70 in an article for the huffington post music executive and author steve stoute criticized the recording academy and the grammy awards for having lost touch with contemporary popular culture and noted two key sources for it 1 overzealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and 2 fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic71 stoute accused the academy of snubbing artists with more cultural impact citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in eminems the marshall mathers lp 2000 and kanye wests graduation 2007 in the album of the year category stoute asserted71 as an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians singers songwriters producers and technical specialists we have come to expect that the grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture unfortunately the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate while there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of steely dan or herbie hancock we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of eminem and kanye west and how their music is shaping influencing and defining the voice of a generation it is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of michael jacksons thriller in 1984 in 2020 canadian artist abel tesfaye known by his stage name the weeknd was shut out from the grammys when his fourth studio album after hours received no nominations at the 63rd annual grammy awards this came as a surprise to critics fans and tesfaye himself who had a successful run in 2020 with the success of both his album and the single blinding lights tesfaye responded by social media calling the grammys corrupt72 speculation arose that the announcement of his thenupcoming super bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus rb contributed to the snubs73 harvey mason jr ceo of the recording academy responded by saying74 we understand that the weeknd is disappointed at not being nominated i was surprised and can empathize with what hes feeling his music this year was excellent and his contributions to the music community and broader world are worthy of everyones admiration we were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming super bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the grammy stage the weekend before unfortunately every year there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists but as the only peervoted music award we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community to be clear voting in all categories ended well before the weeknds performance at the super bowl was announced so in no way could it have affected the nomination process all grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence and we congratulate them all the grammys eligibility period runs from october 1 of one year until september 30 of the next year75 records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that years awards the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time this is despite the quarter falling during the christmas and holiday season when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving and when christmas music is at its natural peak fans unfamiliar with the grammys voting window perennially hold a mistaken notion that a favorite artist has then been snubbed for example adeles album 25 was released in november 2015 and thus was ineligible for nomination for the 2015 awards despite its massive sales earning its grammys including album of the year instead in 201776 conversely the grammys often recognize work more than a year after it was released taylor swifts 1989 won album of the year in 2016 even though the album came out in october 201477 the grammys have also been accused of a racist bias against black recording artists in a 2017 interview canadian artist drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a popmusic artist due to his previous work and heritage he criticized the snubbing of one dance for the record of the year award and the nomination of hotline bling for best rap song and best rapsung performance despite it not being a rap song78 the atlantics spencer kornhaber accused the grammys of sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one79 drake did not attend the 2017 awards ceremony where he was nominated he had a performance in manchester england on february 12 2017 the same night as the ceremony frank ocean was vocal about boycotting the same grammy awards and did not submit his album blonde for award consideration as a protest80 the grammys were also criticized after the 59th annual grammy awards when adeles 25 as mentioned above released in late 2015 won album of the year over beyoncs album lemonade released in april 2016 which many music publications believed should have won the award steve knopper of rolling stone magazine believed that she lost due to the grammy voters being all white males and for her problack performance during the super bowl 50 halftime show81 usa today also criticized beyoncs loss stating that black artists have struggled to win album of the year they also felt 25 won only due to the albums recordbreaking sales rather than having cultural significance and the large impact that lemonade had in 201682 adele also expressed that lemonade should have won over her for album of the year stating in her acceptance speech i cant possibly accept this award and im very humbled and im very grateful and gracious but my artist of my life is beyonc and this album to me the lemonade album is just so monumental beyonc its so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soulbaring and we all got to see another side to you that you dont always let us see and we appreciate that and all us artists here adore you you are our light83 in 2019 for the first time since outkast won album of the year in 2004 rap artists won major award nominations outside the rap categories when childish gambino won the first song and record of the year awards ever for a rap song84 hispanic and latino americans the largest minority in america are also considered to be underrepresented at the grammy awards and their music is prone to be shifted to the categories of the latin grammy awards unless they have a mainstream following8586 in april 2022 the late indian singer lata mangeshkar was omitted from the in memoriam segment and the nations domestic media criticized the grammys and oscars for their westerncentric view of artists receiving attention over those throughout the rest of the world87 the grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically notably at the 60th annual grammy awards in 2018 new zealand singer lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony she suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to tom petty but was refused a solo slot despite being nominated for the album of the year award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance lordes mother sonja yelich also criticized the grammys pointing out an article that only nine percent of the nominees at the previous six grammy ceremonies were women88 after the ceremony several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist sza who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories and to the best pop solo performance category which included four female nominees but was won by ed sheeran89 neil portnow president of the recording academy sparked controversy after stating in an interview that female artists needed to step up in order to win awards portnows comments were criticized by many female musicians including pink katy perry vanessa carlton sheryl crow iggy azalea halsey and charli xcx90 they also caused the hashtag grammyssomale to trend on social media91 before the 61st annual grammy awards in 2019 singer ariana grande decided not to perform or attend that years ceremony over a disagreement about the song choices for her performance an anonymous source told variety that grande felt insulted when producers refused to let the singer perform her latest single 7 rings they compromised by having her perform the song as part of a medley but the condition that the producers choose the second song led grande to withdraw from the show the source said that the same stipulations were not imposed on other performers92 grande later accused grammy producer ken ehrlich of lying about why she dropped out of the show ehrlich had said that grande felt it was too late for her to pull something together grande responded i can pull together a performance over night and you know that ken it was when my creativity and self expression was stifled by you that i decided not to attend i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more93 despite the controversy grande won for best pop vocal album and in 2020 performed at the 62nd annual grammy awards when nominated for five awards including album of the year but won none94 despite past controversies female artists dominated the 63rd annual grammy awards with the big four awards being awarded entirely to women several women also broke records at that ceremony95 in may 2018 it was revealed that money intended for the recording academy charity musicares was siphoned off to pay for the cost overruns of hosting the 60th annual grammy awards at new york citys madison square garden96 concerning the controversies of hosting that years grammy awards in new york dana tomarken the former executive vice president of the musicares foundation claimed wrongful termination she alleges that she was fired for pushing back against the academys boys club she claimed that by having the musicares person of the year tribute to fleetwood mac at radio city music hall the event had to forgo its traditional vip dinner and silent auction she had already been offered a deal to have the event at the barclays center in brooklyn the barclays center is owned by aeg which competes directly with the madison square garden company which owns madison square garden and radio city irving azoff who then had a joint venture with the madison square garden company told tomarken that the event can not be held at barclays and had to be held at radio city oak view group which is associated with azoff received 300 of the highest price tickets to the musicares event at radio city oak view group was supposed to sell them as a package deal which also included tickets to the grammy awards themselves musicares was promised to receive 15 million from those tickets according to tomarken those 300 tickets were never sold and were then returned to musicares which resulted in a loss97 in june 2019 rapper nicki minaj spoke up against the grammys for allegedly blackballing her after her controversial performance of roman holiday at the 54th annual grammy awards98 minaj claimed that producer ken ehrlich who had previously accepted the performance wanted her to cancel it last minute due to what he excused as the passing of whitney houston minaj however refused his request and performed anyway she accused that shortly after the performance ehrlich had snubbed her from winning the best new artist category which was awarded to bon iver in october 2022 minaj went after the grammys again for snubbing her song super freaky girl from the rap categories at the 65th annual grammy awards and instead placing it in the pop categories by way of comparison minaj mentioned lattos 2021 song big energy being potentially considered for the rap categories saying that if minajs own single is not being qualified as a rap song neither should be lattos99 she also accused the grammys of purposely placing her in those categories to favor other artists over her such as adele and harry styles after minajs comments latto later responded to her in a series of tweets leading them into a backandforth argument100 subsequently minajs song was not nominated for any categories for the ceremony while latto received nominations for the best new artist category as well as the best melodic rap performance category for the latter song recording academy ceo deborah dugan was placed on leave on january 16 2020 after a complaint of bullying from a member of staff according to an anonymous new york times source ten days before the 62nd annual grammy awards101 dugan had complained internally alleging a broken system of voting that was subject to conflicts of interest and unnecessary spending101 on the nominations for the 61st annual grammy awards she stated that the voting process was an outrageous conflict of interest with several nominated artists sitting on the voting boards of their prospective categories she claimed that one artist who initially ranked 18 out of 20 in the 2019 song of the year category ended up with a nomination she also claimed that a few artists like ed sheeran and ariana grande had the votes to be nominated for the category but were ultimately omitted102 in 2020 comedy star tiffany haddish turned down the invitation to host the 63rd annual grammy awards pretelecast premiere ceremony when they said that she would have to pay her own way in an exclusive interview with variety haddish revealed that she was told to cover the cost of hair makeup and wardrobe for the threehour event adding i dont know if this might mean i might not get nominated ever again but i think its disrespectful when contacted the recording academy explained that the premiere ceremony is not a cbs program and is hosted by the academy a notforprofit organization meaning that artists hosts and performers have to perform free every year they also noted that the issue would have no impact in haddishs future nomination103 in 2022 the grammys were criticized for nominating and subsequently awarding louis ck a best comedy album prize for his comedy special sincerely louis ck the album made light of and included jokes about the multiple sexual misconduct revelations he had admitted to years earlier104105 in 2023 the grammys faced significant backlash for debuting a new award called the dr dre global impact award due to the rappers history of violence against women106107108 before the first live grammys telecast in 1971 on abc a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called the best on record was broadcast on nbc the first grammy award telecast took place on the night of november 29 1959 as an episode of the nbc anthology series nbc sunday showcase which normally was
