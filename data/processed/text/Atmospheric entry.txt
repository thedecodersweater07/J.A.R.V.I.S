atmospheric entry sometimes listed as vimpact or ventry is the movement of an object from outer space into and through the gases of an atmosphere of a planet dwarf planet or natural satellite atmospheric entry may be uncontrolled entry as in the entry of astronomical objects space debris or bolides it may be controlled entry or reentry of a spacecraft that can be navigated or follow a predetermined course methods for controlled atmospheric entry descent and landing of spacecraft are collectively termed as edl objects entering an atmosphere experience atmospheric drag which puts mechanical stress on the object and aerodynamic heatingcaused mostly by compression of the air in front of the object but also by drag these forces can cause loss of mass ablation or even complete disintegration of smaller objects and objects with lower compressive strength can explode objects have reentered with speeds ranging from 78 kms for low earth orbit to around 125 kms for the stardust probe1 they have high kinetic energies and atmospheric dissipation is the only way of expending this as it is highly impractical to use retrorockets for the entire reentry procedure crewed space vehicles must be slowed to subsonic speeds before parachutes or air brakes may be deployed ballistic warheads and expendable vehicles do not require slowing at reentry and in fact are made streamlined so as to maintain their speed furthermore slowspeed returns to earth from nearspace such as highaltitude parachute jumps from balloons do not require heat shielding because the gravitational acceleration of an object starting at relative rest from within the atmosphere itself or not far above it cannot create enough velocity to cause significant atmospheric heating for earth atmospheric entry occurs by convention at the krmn line at an altitude of 100 km 62 miles 54 nautical miles above the surface while at venus atmospheric entry occurs at 250 km 160 mi 130 nmi and at mars atmospheric entry occurs at about 80 km 50 mi 43 nmi uncontrolled objects reach high velocities while accelerating through space toward the earth under the influence of earths gravity and are slowed by friction upon encountering earths atmosphere meteors are also often travelling quite fast relative to the earth simply because their own orbital path is different from that of the earth before they encounter earths gravity well most objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their suborbital eg intercontinental ballistic missile reentry vehicles orbital eg the soyuz or unbounded eg meteors trajectories various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities an alternative method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancy2 which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres strong gravity or both factors complicate highvelocity hyperbolic entry such as the atmospheres of venus titan and the giant planets3 the concept of the ablative heat shield was described as early as 1920 by robert goddard in the case of meteors which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as 30 miles 48 km per second the interior of the meteors remains cold and the erosion is due to a large extent to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface for this reason if the outer surface of the apparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between the surface would not be eroded to any considerable extent especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not be nearly so great as that of the average meteor4 practical development of reentry systems began as the range and reentry velocity of ballistic missiles increased for early shortrange missiles like the v2 stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues many v2s broke apart during reentry but heating was not a serious problem mediumrange missiles like the soviet r5 with a 1200kilometer 650nauticalmile range required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry the first icbms with ranges of 8000 to 12000 km 4300 to 6500 nmi were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and bluntshaped vehicles in the united states this technology was pioneered by h julian allen and a j eggers jr of the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca at ames research center5 in 1951 they made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape high drag made the most effective heat shield6 from simple engineering principles allen and eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the drag coefficient ie the greater the drag the less the heat load if the reentry vehicle is made blunt air cannot get out of the way quickly enough and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward away from the vehicle since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere the allen and eggers discovery though initially treated as a military secret was eventually published in 19587 when atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery particularly on a planetary body other than earth entry is part of a phase referred to as entry descent and landing or edl8 when the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from the event is referred to as reentry almost always referring to earth entry the fundamental design objective in atmospheric entry of a spacecraft is to dissipate the energy of a spacecraft that is traveling at hypersonic speed as it enters an atmosphere such that equipment cargo and any passengers are slowed and land near a specific destination on the surface at zero velocity while keeping stresses on the spacecraft and any passengers within acceptable limits9 this may be accomplished by propulsive or aerodynamic vehicle characteristics or parachute means or by some combination there are several basic shapes used in designing entry vehicles the simplest axisymmetric shape is the sphere or spherical section10 this can either be a complete sphere or a spherical section forebody with a converging conical afterbody the aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using newtonian impact theory likewise the spherical sections heat flux can be accurately modeled with the fayriddell equation11 the static stability of a spherical section is assured if the vehicles center of mass is upstream from the center of curvature dynamic stability is more problematic pure spheres have no lift however by flying at an angle of attack a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some crossrange capability and widening its entry corridor in the late 1950s and early 1960s highspeed computers were not yet available and computational fluid dynamics was still embryonic because the spherical section was amenable to closedform analysis that geometry became the default for conservative design consequently crewed capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section pure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early soviet vostok and voskhod capsules and in soviet mars and venera descent vehicles the apollo command module used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical afterbody it flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of 27 0 is bluntend first to yield an average ld lifttodrag ratio of 036812 the resultant lift achieved a measure of crossrange control by offsetting the vehicles center of mass from its axis of symmetry allowing the lift force to be directed left or right by rolling the capsule on its longitudinal axis other examples of the spherical section geometry in crewed capsules are soyuzzond gemini and mercury even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak gforce reducing it from 89 g for a purely ballistic slowed only by drag trajectory to 45 g as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat13 the spherecone is a spherical section with a frustum or blunted cone attached the spherecones dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section the vehicle enters spherefirst with a sufficiently small halfangle and properly placed center of mass a spherecone can provide aerodynamic stability from keplerian entry to surface impact the halfangle is the angle between the cones axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface and thus half the angle made by the cones surface edges the original american spherecone aeroshell was the mk2 rv reentry vehicle which was developed in 1955 by the general electric corp the mk2s design was derived from bluntbody theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system tps based upon a metallic heat shield the different tps types are later described in this article the mk2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system ie it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower ballistic coefficient and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to radar these defects made the mk2 overly susceptible to antiballistic missile abm systems consequently an alternative spherecone rv to the mk2 was developed by general electriccitation needed this new rv was the mk6 which used a nonmetallic ablative tps a nylon phenolic this new tps was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possiblecitation needed however the mk6 was a huge rv with an entry mass of 3360 kg a length of 31 m and a halfangle of 125 subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative tps design allowed rvs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the mk6 since the 1960s the spherecone has become the preferred geometry for modern icbm rvs with typical halfangles being between 10 and 11citation needed reconnaissance satellite rvs recovery vehicles also used a spherecone shape and were the first american example of a nonmunition entry vehicle discovereri launched on 28 february 1959 the spherecone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space eg stardust probe unlike with military rvs the advantage of the blunt bodys lower tps mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the galileo probe with a halfangle of 45 or the viking aeroshell with a halfangle of 70 space exploration spherecone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of mars venus jupiter and titan the biconic is a spherecone with an additional frustum attached the biconic offers a significantly improved ld ratio a biconic designed for mars aerocapture typically has an ld of approximately 10 compared to an ld of 0368 for the apollocm the higher ld makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to mars due to the lower peak deceleration arguably the most significant biconic ever flown was the advanced maneuverable reentry vehicle amarv four amarvs were made by the mcdonnell douglas corp and represented a significant leap in rv sophistication three amarvs were launched by minuteman1 icbms on 20 december 1979 8 october 1980 and 4 october 1981 amarv had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg a nose radius of 234 cm a forwardfrustum halfangle of 104 an interfrustum radius of 146 cm aftfrustum halfangle of 6 and an axial length of 2079 meters no accurate diagram or picture of amarv has ever appeared in the open literature however a schematic sketch of an amarvlike vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published14 amarvs attitude was controlled through a split body flap also called a splitwindward flap along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicles sides hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps amarv was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading antiballistic missile abm interception the mcdonnell douglas dcx also a biconic was essentially a scaledup version of amarv amarv and the dcx also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the lockheed martin x33 nonaxisymmetric shapes have been used for crewed entry vehicles one example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a delta wing for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider this approach has been used by the american space shuttle the soviet buran and the indevelopment starship the lifting body is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the x23 prime precision recovery including maneuvering entry vehiclecitation needed objects entering an atmosphere from space at high velocities relative to the atmosphere will cause very high levels of heating atmospheric entry heating comes principally from two sources as velocity increases both convective and radiative heating increase but at different rates at very high speeds radiative heating will dominate the convective heat fluxes as radiative heating is proportional to the eighth power of velocity while convective heating is proportional to the third power of velocity radiative heating thus predominates early in atmospheric entry while convection predominates in the later phases15 during certain intensity of ionization a radioblackout with the spacecraft is produced16 while nasas earth entry interface is at 400000 feet 122 km the main heating during controlled entry takes place at altitudes of 65 to 35 kilometres 213000 to 115000 ft peaking at 58 kilometres 190000 ft17 at typical reentry temperatures the air in the shock layer is both ionized and dissociatedcitation needed18 this chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layers thermal and chemical properties there are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields almost all aeronautical engineers are taught the perfect ideal gas model during their undergraduate education most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in naca report 113519 excerpts from naca report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft the perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft but assumes that the gas is chemically inert from the standpoint of aircraft design air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than 550 k 277 c 530 f at one atmosphere pressure the perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 k and is not usable at temperatures greater than 2000 k 1730 c 3140 f for temperatures greater than 2000 k a heat shield designer must use a real gas model an entry vehicles pitching moment can be significantly influenced by realgas effects both the apollo command module and the space shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate realgas modelling the apollocms trimangle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor the actual aerodynamic center of the columbia was upstream from the calculated value due to realgas effects on columbias maiden flight sts1 astronauts john young and robert crippen had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle20 an equilibrium realgas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature this is called thermodynamic equilibrium when air is processed by a shock wave it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shocklayer heating it is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heatingoriginal research the distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicles leading edge is called shock wave stand off an approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 014 times the nose radius one can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 78 kms and a nose radius of 1 meter ie time of travel is about 18 microseconds this is roughly the time required for shockwaveinitiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 78 kms entry into air during peak heat flux consequently as air approaches the entry vehicles stagnation point the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable for this case most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and not in a state of equilibrium the fayriddell equation11 which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium the time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layers pressure for example in the case of the galileo probes entry into jupiters atmosphere the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39 kms during peak heat flux determining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model under a perfect gas model the ratio of specific heats also called isentropic exponent adiabatic index gamma or kappa is assumed to be constant along with the gas constant for a real gas the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the isentropic chain for a real gas the isentropic chain is unusable and a mollier diagram would be used instead for manual calculation however graphical solution with a mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table another form of mollier diagram or a chemistry based thermodynamics program the chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the gibbs free energy method gibbs free energy is simply the total enthalpy of the gas minus its total entropy times temperature a chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reactionrate equations the program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible gibbs free energy is calculated a newtonraphson method is the usual numerical scheme the data base for a gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining partition functions among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program chemical equilibrium with applications cea which was written by bonnie j mcbride and sanford gordon at nasa lewis now renamed nasa glenn research center other names for cea are the gordon and mcbride code and the lewis code cea is quite accurate up to 10000 k for planetary atmospheric gases but unusable beyond 20000 k double ionization is not modelled cea can be downloaded from the internet along with full documentation and will compile on linux under the g77 fortran compiler a nonequilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layers gas physics but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model the simplest nonequilibrium model is the lighthillfreeman model developed in 19582122 the lighthillfreeman model initially assumes a gas made up of a single diatomic species susceptible to only one chemical formula and its reverse eg n2 n n and n n n2 dissociation and recombination because of its simplicity the lighthillfreeman model is a useful pedagogical tool but is too simple for modelling nonequilibrium air air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 07812 molecular nitrogen 02095 molecular oxygen and 00093 argon the simplest real gas model for air is the five species model which is based upon n2 o2 no n and o the five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide when running a gibbs free energy equilibrium programclarification needed the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate with a nonequilibrium program the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas the five species model has 17 chemical formulas 34 when counting reverse formulas the lighthillfreeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation the five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equationscitation needed because the 5 ordinary differential equations are tightly coupled the system is numerically stiff and difficult to solve the five species model is only usable for entry from low earth orbit where entry velocity is approximately 78 kms 28000 kmh 17000 mph for lunar return entry of 11 kms23 the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen the fivespecies model is no longer accurate and a twelvespecies model must be used instead atmospheric entry interface velocities on a marsearth trajectory are on the order of 12 kms 43000 kmh 27000 mph24 modeling highspeed mars atmospheric entrywhich involves a carbon dioxide nitrogen and argon atmosphereis even more complex requiring a 19species modelcitation needed an important aspect of modelling nonequilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux if a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed hyperbolic trajectory lunar return and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate tps heating radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules eg cyanogen cn carbon monoxide nitric oxide no single ionized molecular nitrogen etc these molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species the newly formed diatomic molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the vibrational energy into radiant energy ie radiative heat flux the whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge the experimental measurement of radiative heat flux typically done with shock tubes along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady schrdinger equation are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s but largely discontinued after conclusion of the apollo program radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure apollos success however radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide mars entry is still barely understood and will require major researchcitation needed the frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium the name frozen gas can be misleading a frozen gas is not frozen like ice is frozen water rather a frozen gas is frozen in time all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules if gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium however it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop for that situation the gas is considered frozencitation needed the distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties speedofsound viscosity etc for the same thermodynamic state eg pressure and temperature frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle during reentry free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicles shock wave nonequilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicles leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing the frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult thermal protection shield tps heating in the vehicles afterbody is usually not very high but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicles wake can significantly influence aerodynamics pitching moment and particularly dynamic stabilitycitation needed a thermal protection system or tps is the barrier that protects a spacecraft during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use among them ablative heat shields passive cooling and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces in general they can be divided into two categories ablative tps and reusable tps ablative tps are required when space craft reach a relatively low altitude before slowing downdubious discuss spacecraft like the space shuttle are designed to slow down at high altitude so that they can use reuseable tps see space shuttle thermal protection system thermal protection systems are tested in high enthalpy ground testing or plasma wind tunnels that reproduce the combination of high enthalpy and high stagnation pressure using induction plasma or dc plasma the ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shields outer wall creating a cooler boundary layer the boundary layer comes from blowing of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux the overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shields outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called blockage ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative tps the outer surface of the tps material chars melts and sublimes while the bulk of the tps material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases the gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis so that the ablative performance can be evaluated25 ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the galileo probe tps material carbon phenolic early research on ablation technology in the usa was centered at nasas ames research center located at moffett field california ames research center was ideal since it had numerous wind tunnels capable of generating varying wind velocities initial experiments typically mounted a mockup of the ablative material to be analyzed within a hypersonic wind tunnel26 testing of ablative materials occurs at the ames arc jet complex many spacecraft thermal protection systems have been tested in this facility including the apollo space shuttle and orion heat shield materials27 carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material used in the space shuttle solid rocket booster and for reentryvehicle nose tips the thermal conductivity of a particular tps material is usually proportional to the materials density28 carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material but also has high density which is undesirable the nasa galileo probe used carbon phenolic for its tps material29 if the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the tps materials conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the tps bondline material thus leading to tps failure consequently for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lowerdensity tps materials such as the following examples can be better design choices sla in sla561v stands for super lightweight ablator sla561v is a proprietary ablative made by lockheed martin that has been used as the primary tps material on all of the 70 spherecone entry vehicles sent by nasa to mars other than the mars science laboratory msl sla561v begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110 wcm2 but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300 wcm2 the msl aeroshell tps is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234 wcm2 the peak heat flux experienced by the viking 1 aeroshell which landed on mars was 21 wcm2 for viking 1 the tps acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation viking 1 was the first mars lander and based upon a very conservative design the viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 354 meters the largest used on mars until mars science laboratory sla561v is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is prebonded to the aeroshells structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield30 phenolicimpregnated carbon ablator pica a carbon fiber preform impregnated in phenolic resin31 is a modern tps material and has the advantages of low density much lighter than carbon phenolic coupled with efficient ablative ability at high heat flux it is a good choice for ablative applications such as highpeakheating conditions found on samplereturn missions or lunarreturn missions picas thermal conductivity is lower than other highheatfluxablative materials such as conventional carbon phenolicscitation needed pica was patented by nasa ames research center in the 1990s and was the primary tps material for the stardust aeroshell32 the stardust samplereturn capsule was the fastest manmade object ever to reenter earths atmosphere at 28000 mph ca 125 kms at 135 km altitude this was faster than the apollo mission capsules and 70 faster than the shuttle1 pica was critical for the viability of the stardust mission which returned to earth in 2006 stardusts heat shield 081 m base diameter was made of one monolithic piece sized to withstand a nominal peak heating rate of 12 kwcm2 a pica heat shield was also used for the mars science laboratory entry into the martian atmosphere33 an improved and easier to produce version called picax was developed by spacex in 2006201033 for the dragon space capsule34 the first reentry test of a picax heat shield was on the dragon c1 mission on 8 december 201035 the picax heat shield was designed developed and fully qualified by a small team of a dozen engineers and technicians in less than four years33 picax is ten times less expensive to manufacture than the nasa pica heat shield material36 a second enhanced version of picacalled pica3was developed by spacex during the mid2010s it was first flight tested on the crew dragon spacecraft in 2019 during the flight demonstration mission in april 2019 and put into regular service on that spacecraft in 202037 pica and most other ablative tps materials are either proprietary or classified with formulations and manufacturing processes not disclosed in the open literature this limits the ability of researchers to study these materials and hinders the development of thermal protection systems thus the high enthalpy flow diagnostics group hefdig at the university of stuttgart has developed an open carbonphenolic ablative material called the hefdig ablationresearch laboratory experiment material harlem from commercially available materials harlem is prepared by impregnating a preform of a carbon fiber porous monolith such as calcarb rigid carbon insulation with a solution of resole phenolic resin and polyvinylpyrrolidone in ethylene glycol heating to polymerize the resin and then removing the solvent under vacuum the resulting material is cured and machined to the desired shape3839 siliconeimpregnated reusable ceramic ablator sirca was also developed at nasa ames research center and was used on the backshell interface plate bip of the mars pathfinder and mars exploration rover mer aeroshells the bip was at the attachment points between the aeroshells backshell also called the afterbody or aft cover and the cruise ring also called the cruise stage sirca was also the primary tps material for the unsuccessful deep space 2 ds2 mars impactor probes with their 035meterbasediameter 11 ft aeroshells sirca is a monolithic insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation it is the only tps material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft there is no postprocessing heat treating or additional coatings required unlike space shuttle tiles since sirca can be machined to precise shapes it can be applied as tiles leading edge sections full nose caps or in any number of custom shapes or sizes as of 1996update sirca had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications but not yet as a forebody tps material40 avcoat is a nasadeveloped material used in the design of several ablative heat shields41 nasa originally used it for the apollo command module in the 1960s and then utilized the material for its nextgeneration beyond low earth orbit orion crew module which first flew in a december 2014 test and then operationally in november 202242 the avcoat to be used on orion has been reformulated to meet environmental legislation that has been passed since the end of apollo4344 thermal soak is a part of almost all tps schemes for example an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis from that time to the end of the heat pulse heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shields outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payloadcitation needed this outcome can be prevented by ejecting the heat shield with its heat soak prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall refractory insulation keeps the heat in the outermost layer of the spacecraft surface where it is conducted away by the air45 the temperature of the surface rises to incandescent levels so the material must have a very high melting point and the material must also exhibit very low thermal conductivity materials with these properties tend to be brittle delicate and difficult to fabricate in large sizes so they are generally fabricated as relatively small tiles that are then attached to the structural skin of the spacecraft there is a tradeoff between toughness and thermal conductivity less conductive materials are generally more brittle the space shuttle used multiple types of tiles tiles are also used on the boeing x37 dream chaser and starships upper stage because insulation cannot be perfect some heat energy is stored in the insulation and in the underlying material thermal soaking and must be dissipated after the spacecraft exits the hightemperature flight regime some of this heat will reradiate through the surface or will be carried off the surface by convection but some will heat the spacecraft structure and interior which may require active cooling after landing45 typical space shuttle tps tiles li900 have remarkable thermal protection properties an li900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1000 k on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side however they are relatively brittle and break easily and cannot survive inflight rain46 in some early ballistic missile rvs eg the mk2 and the suborbital mercury spacecraft radiatively cooled tps were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse and then after the heat pulse radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere however the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal tps eg titanium beryllium copper etc modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermalsoak tps instead thermal protection systems relying on emissivity use high emissivity coatings hecs to facilitate radiative cooling while an underlying porous ceramic layer serves to protect the structure from high surface temperatures high thermally stable emissivity values coupled with low thermal conductivity are key to the functionality of such systems47 radiatively cooled tps can be found on modern entry vehicles but reinforced carboncarbon rcc also called carboncarbon is normally used instead of metal rcc was the tps material on the space shuttles nose cone and wing leading edges and was also proposed as the leadingedge material for the x33 carbon is the most refractory material known with a oneatmosphere sublimation temperature of 3825 c 6917 f for graphite this high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled tps material disadvantages of rcc are that it is currently expensive to manufacture is heavy and lacks robust impact resistance48 some highvelocity aircraft such as the sr71 blackbird and concorde deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft but at much lower intensity and for hours at a time studies of the sr71s titanium skin revealed that the metal structure was restored to its original strength through annealing due to aerodynamic heating in the case of the concorde the aluminium nose was permitted to reach a maximum operating temperature of 127 c 261 f approximately 180 c 324 f warmer than the normally subzero ambient air the metallurgical implications loss of temper that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft a radiatively cooled tps for an entry vehicle is often called a hotmetal tps early tps designs for the space shuttle called for a hotmetal tps based upon a nickel superalloy dubbed ren 41 and titanium shingles49 this shuttle tps concept was rejected because it was believed a silica tilebased tps would involve lower development and manufacturing costscitation needed a nickel superalloyshingle tps was again proposed for the unsuccessful x33 singlestagetoorbit ssto prototype50 recently newer radiatively cooled tps materials have been developed that could be superior to rcc known as ultrahigh temperature ceramics they were developed for the prototype vehicle slender hypervelocity aerothermodynamic research probe sharp these tps materials are based on zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride sharp tps have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained mach 7 flight at sea level mach 11 flight at 100000foot 30000 m altitudes and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight sharp tps materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combinedcyclepropelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies sharp materials have exhibited effective tps characteristics from zero to more than 2000 c 3630 f with melting points over 3500 c 6330 f they are structurally stronger than rcc and thus do not require structural reinforcement with materials such as inconel sharp materials are extremely efficient at reradiating absorbed heat thus eliminating the need for additional tps behind and between the sharp materials and conventional vehicle structure nasa initially funded and discontinued a multiphase rd program through the university of montana in 2001 to test sharp materials on test vehicles5152 various advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperatureresistant metal alloys that incorporate a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them such a tps concept was proposed for the x30 national aerospace plane nasp in the mid80scitation needed the nasp was supposed to have been a scramjet powered hypersonic aircraft but failed in developmentcitation needed in 2005 and 2012 two unmanned lifting body craft with actively cooled hulls were launched as a part of the german sharp edge flight experiment shefexcitation needed in early 2019 spacex was developing an actively cooled heat shield for its starship spacecraft where a part of the thermal protection system will be a transpirationally cooled outerskin design for the reentering spaceship5354 however spacex abandoned this approach in favor of a modern version of heat shield tiles later in 20195556 the stoke space nova second stage announced in october 2023 and not yet flying uses a regeneratively cooled by liquid hydrogen heat shield57 in the early 1960s various tps systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer or passed through channels in the heat shield advantages included the possibility of more allmetal designs which would be cheaper to develop be more rugged and eliminate the need for classified and unknown technology the disadvantages are increased weight and complexity and lower reliability the concept has never been flown but a similar technology the plug nozzle49 did undergo extensive ground testing fuel permitting nothing prevents a vehicle from entering the atmosphere with a retrograde engine burn which has the double effect of slowing the vehicle down much faster than atmospheric drag alone would and forcing the compressed hot air away from the vehicles body during reentry the first stage of the spacex falcon 9 performs an entry burn to rapidly decelerate from its initial hypersonic speedcitation needed in 2004 aircraft designer burt rutan demonstrated the feasibility of a shapechanging airfoil for reentry with the suborbital spaceshipone the wings on this craft rotate upward into the feathered configuration that provides a shuttlecock effect thus spaceshipone achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads the configuration increases drag as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise the aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry secondly the aircraft will automatically orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude58 however the velocity attained by spaceshipone prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft and engineers including rutan recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit on 4 may 2011 the first test on the spaceshiptwo of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release from the white knight two premature deployment of the feathering system was responsible for the 2014 vss enterprise crash in which the aircraft disintegrated killing the copilot the feathered reentry was first described by dean chapman of naca in 195859 in the section of his report on composite entry chapman described a solution to the problem using a highdrag device it may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to achieve some advantages for landing maneuverability it obviously is advantageous to employ a lifting vehicle the total heat absorbed by a lifting vehicle however is much higher than for a nonlifting vehicle nonlifting vehicles can more easily be constructed by employing for example a large light drag device the larger the device the smaller is the heating rate nonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry an evident composite type of entry which combines some of the desirable features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories would be to enter first without lift but with a drag device then when the velocity is reduced to a certain value the device is jettisoned or retracted leaving a lifting vehicle for the remainder of the descent deceleration for atmospheric reentry especially for higherspeed marsreturn missions benefits from maximizing the drag area of the entry system the larger the diameter of the aeroshell the bigger the payload can be60 an inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a lowmass design such an inflatable shieldaerobrake was designed for the penetrators of mars 96 mission since the mission failed due to the launcher malfunction the npo lavochkin and dasaesa have designed a mission for earth orbit the inflatable reentry and descent technology irdt demonstrator was launched on soyuzfregat on 8 february 2000 the inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered6162 the subsequent missions flown on the volna rocket failed due to launcher failure63 nasa launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 august 2009 with the successful first test flight of the inflatable reentry vehicle experiment irve the heat shield had been vacuumpacked into a 15inchdiameter 38 cm payload shroud and launched on a black brant 9 sounding rocket from nasas wallops flight facility on wallops island virginia nitrogen inflated the 10footdiameter 30 m heat shield made of several layers of siliconecoated kevlar fabric to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff60 the rocket apogee was at an altitude of 131 miles 211 km where it began its descent to supersonic speed less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of 124 miles 200 km the inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds60 following the success of the initial irve experiments nasa developed the concept into the more ambitious hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator hiad the current design is shaped like a shallow cone with the structure built up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major diameter the forward convex face of the cone is covered with a flexible thermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of atmospheric entry or reentry6465 in 2012 a hiad was tested as inflatable reentry vehicle experiment 3 irve3 using a suborbital sounding rocket and worked66 8 see also lowdensity supersonic decelerator a nasa project with tests in 2014 and 2015 of a 6 m diameter siadr a 6meter 20 ft inflatable reentry vehicle lowearth orbit flight test of an inflatable decelerator loftid67 was launched in november 2022 inflated in orbit reentered faster than mach 25 and was successfully recovered on november 10 there are four critical parameters considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entrycitation needed peak heat flux and dynamic pressure selects the tps material heat load selects the thickness of the tps material stack peak deceleration is of major importance for crewed missions the upper limit for crewed return to earth from low earth orbit leo or lunar return is 10g68 for martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity the upper limit is 4g68 peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost tps material if spallation is an issue the reentry vehicles design parameters may be assessed through numerical simulation including simplifications of the vehicles dynamics such as the planar reentry equations and heat flux correlations69 starting from the principle of conservative design the engineer typically considers two worstcase trajectories the undershoot and overshoot trajectories the overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowestallowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skipoff the overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the tps thickness the undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory for crewed missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration the undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure consequently the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the tps material there is no one size fits all tps material a tps material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive too dense for a long duration heat load a lowdensity tps material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high a tps material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased this happened with nasas r4 test spacecraft68 older tps materials tend to be more laborintensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials however modern tps materials often lack the flight history of the older materials an important consideration for a riskaverse designer based upon allen and eggers discovery maximum aeroshell bluntness maximum drag yields minimum tps mass maximum bluntness minimum ballistic coefficient also yields a minimal terminal velocity at maximum altitude very important for mars edl but detrimental for military rvs however there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon shock wave detachment a shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cones halfangle is below a critical value this critical halfangle can be estimated using perfect gas theory this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds for a nitrogen atmosphere earth or titan the maximum allowed halfangle is approximately 60 for a carbon dioxide atmosphere mars or venus the maximumallowed halfangle is approximately 70 after shock wave detachment an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point the subsonic cap consequently the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability it is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for titan entry huygens probe in a nitrogen atmosphere for mars entry beagle 2 in a carbon dioxide atmospherecitation neededoriginal research prior to being abandoned the soviet mars lander program achieved one successful landing mars 3 on the second of three entry attempts the others were mars 2 and mars 6 the soviet mars landers were based upon a 60 halfangle aeroshell design a 45 halfangle spherecone is typically used for atmospheric probes surface landing not intended even though tps mass is not minimized the rationale for a 45 halfangle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entrytoimpact the heat shield is not jettisoned or a shortandsharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison a 45 spherecone design was used with the ds2 mars impactor and pioneer venus probes not all atmospheric reentries have been completely successful some reentries have resulted in significant disasters of satellites that reenter approximately 1040 of the mass of the object may reach the surface of the earth72 on average about one catalogued object reentered per day as of 2014update73 because the earths surface is predominantly water most objects that survive reentry land in one of the worlds oceans the estimated chance that a given person would get hit and injured during their lifetime is around 1 in a trillion74 on january 24 1978 the soviet kosmos 954 3800 kilograms 8400 lb reentered and crashed near great slave lake in the northwest territories of canada the satellite was nuclearpowered and left radioactive debris near its impact site75 on july 11 1979 the us skylab space station 77100 kilograms 170000 lb reentered and spread debris across the australian outback76 the reentry was a major media event largely due to the cosmos 954 incident but not viewed as much as a potential disaster since it did not carry toxic nuclear or hydrazine fuel nasa had originally hoped to use a space shuttle mission to either extend its life or enable a controlled reentry but delays in the shuttle program plus unexpectedly high solar activity made this impossible7778 on february 7 1991 the soviet salyut 7 space station 19820 kilograms 43700 lb with the kosmos 1686 module 20000 kilograms 44000 lb attached reentered and scattered debris over the town of capitn bermdez argentina794980 the station had been boosted to a higher orbit in august 1986 in an attempt to keep it up until 1994 but in a scenario similar to skylab the planned buran shuttle was cancelled and high solar activity caused it to come down sooner than expected on september 7 2011 nasa announced the impending uncontrolled reentry of the upper atmosphere research satellite 6540 kilograms 14420 lb and noted that there was a small risk to the public81 the decommissioned satellite reentered the atmosphere on september 24 2011 and some pieces are presumed to have crashed into the south pacific ocean over a debris field 500 miles 800 km long82 on april 1 2018 the chinese tiangong1 space station 8510 kilograms 18760 lb reentered over the pacific ocean halfway between australia and south america83 the china manned space engineering office had intended to control the reentry but lost telemetry and control in march 201784 on may 11 2020 the core stage of chinese long march 5b cospar id 2020027c weighing roughly 20000 kilograms 44000 lb made an uncontrolled reentry over the atlantic ocean near west african coast8586 few pieces of rocket debris reportedly survived reentry and fell over at least two villages in ivory coast8788 on may 8 2021 the core stage of chinese long march 5b cospar id 20210035b weighing 23000 kilograms 51000 lb made an uncontrolled reentry just west of the maldives in the indian ocean approximately 7247e longitude and 265n latitude89 witnesses reported rocket debris as far away as the arabian peninsula90 salyut 1 the worlds first space station was deliberately deorbited into the pacific ocean in 1971 following the soyuz 11 accident its successor salyut 6 was deorbited in a controlled manner as well on june 4 2000 the compton gamma ray observatory was deliberately deorbited after one of its gyroscopes failed the debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the pacific ocean the observatory was still operational but the failure of another gyroscope would have made deorbiting much more difficult and dangerous with some controversy nasa decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random in 2001 the russian mir space station was deliberately deorbited and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric reentry mir entered the earths atmosphere on march 23 2001 near nadi fiji and fell into the south pacific ocean on february 21 2008 a disabled us spy satellite usa193 was hit at an altitude of approximately 246 kilometers 153 mi with an sm3 missile fired from the us navy cruiser lake erie off the coast of hawaii the satellite was inoperative having failed to reach its intended orbit when it was launched in 2006 due to its rapidly deteriorating orbit it was destined for uncontrolled reentry within a month us department of defense expressed concern that the 1000pound 450 kg fuel tank containing highly toxic hydrazine might survive reentry to reach the earths surface intact several governments including those of russia china and belarus protested the action as a thinly veiled demonstration of us antisatellite capabilities91 china had previously caused an international incident when it tested an antisatellite missile in 2007 atmospheric entry has a measurable impact on earths atmosphere particularly the stratosphere atmospheric entry by spacecrafts accounted for 3 of all atmospheric entries by 2021 but in a scenario in which the number of satellites since 2019 are doubled artificial entries would make 40 of all entries92 which would cause atmospheric aerosols to be 94 artificial93 the impact of spacecrafts burning up in the atmosphere during artificial atmospheric entry is different to meteors due to the spacecrafts generally larger size and different composition the atmospheric pollutants produced by artificial atmospheric burningup have been traced in the atmosphere and identified as reacting and possibly negatively impacting the composition of the atmosphere and particularly the ozone layer92 considering space sustainability in regard to atmospheric impact of reentry is by 2022 just developing94 and has been identified in 2024 as suffering from atmosphereblindness causing global environmental injustice95 this is identified as a result of the current endof life spacecraft management which favors the station keeping practice of controlled reentry95 this is mainly done to prevent the dangers from uncontrolled atmospheric entries and space debris95 suggested alternatives are the use of less polluting materials and by inorbit servicing and potentially inspace recycling9495
