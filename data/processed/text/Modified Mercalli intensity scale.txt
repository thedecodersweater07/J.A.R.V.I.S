the modified mercalli intensity scale mm mmi or mcs measures the effects of an earthquake at a given location this is in contrast with the seismic magnitude usually reported for an earthquake magnitude scales measure the inherent force or strength of an earthquake an event occurring at greater or lesser depth the mw scale is widely used the mmi scale measures intensity of shaking at any particular location on the surface it was developed from giuseppe mercallis mercalli intensity scale of 1902 while shaking experienced at the surface is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves they also differ in the depth at which they occur deeper earthquakes have less interaction with the surface their energy is spread throughout a larger volume and the energy reaching the surface is spread across a larger area shaking intensity is localised it generally diminishes with distance from the earthquakes epicentre but it can be amplified in sedimentary basins and in certain kinds of unconsolidated soils intensity scales categorise intensity empirically based on the effects reported by untrained observers and are adapted for the effects that might be observed in a particular region1 by not requiring instrumental measurements they are useful for estimating the magnitude and location of historical preinstrumental earthquakes the greatest intensities generally correspond to the epicentral area and their degree and extent possibly augmented by knowledge of local geological conditions can be compared with other local earthquakes to estimate the magnitude italian volcanologist giuseppe mercalli formulated his first intensity scale in 18832 it had six degrees or categories has been described as merely an adaptation of the thenstandard rossiforel scale of 10 degrees and is now more or less forgotten3 mercallis second scale published in 1902 was also an adaptation of the rossiforel scale retaining the 10 degrees and expanding the descriptions of each degree4 this version found favour with the users and was adopted by the italian central office of meteorology and geodynamics5 in 1904 adolfo cancani proposed adding two additional degrees for very strong earthquakes catastrophe and enormous catastrophe thus creating a 12degree scale6 his descriptions being deficient august heinrich sieberg augmented them during 1912 and 1923 and indicated a peak ground acceleration for each degree78 this became known as the mercallicancani scale formulated by sieberg or the mercallicancanisieberg scale or simply mcs8 and was used extensively in europe and remains in use in italy by the national institute of geophysics and volcanology ingv9 when harry o wood and frank neumann translated this into english in 1931 along with modification and condensation of the descriptions and removal of the acceleration criterion they named it the modified mercalli intensity scale of 1931 mm3110 some seismologists refer to this version as the woodneumann scale8 wood and neumann also had an abridged version with fewer criteria for assessing the degree of intensity the woodneumann scale was revised in 1956 by charles francis richter and published in his influential textbook elementary seismology11 not wanting to have this intensity scale confused with the richter scale he had developed he proposed calling it the modified mercalli scale of 1956 mm568 in their 1993 compendium of historical seismicity in the united states12 carl stover and jerry coffman ignored richters revision and assigned intensities according to their slightly modified interpretation of wood and neumanns 1931 scalea effectively creating a new but largely undocumented version of the scale13 the basis by which the united states geological survey and other agencies assigns intensities is nominally wood and neumanns mm31 however this is generally interpreted with the modifications summarised by stover and coffman because in the decades since 1931 some criteria are more reliable than others as indicators of the level of ground shaking14 also construction codes and methods have evolved making much of built environment stronger these make a given intensity of ground shaking seem weaker15 also some of the original criteria of the most intense degrees x and above such as bent rails ground fissures landslides etc are related less to the level of ground shaking than to the presence of ground conditions susceptible to spectacular failure14 the categories catastrophe and enormous catastrophe added by cancani xi and xii are used so infrequently that current usgs practice is to merge them into a single category extreme abbreviated as x16 the lesser degrees of the mmi scale generally describe the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people the greater numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage this table gives mmis that are typically observed at locations near the epicentre of the earthquake17 magnitude and intensity while related are very different concepts magnitude is a function of the energy liberated by an earthquake while intensity is the degree of shaking experienced at a point on the surface and varies from some maximum intensity at or near the epicentre out to zero at distance it depends upon many factors including the depth of the hypocentre terrain distance from the epicentre whether the underlying strata there amplify surface shaking and any directionality due to the earthquake mechanism for example a magnitude 82 quake between la paz and beni departments bolivia in 1994 that was 6313 km deep had a maximum felt intensity of iv19 while a magnitude 22 event in barrowinfurness england in 1865 about 1 km deep had a maximum felt intensity of viii20 despite the magnitude 82 earthquake releasing 1000000000 times more energy than the magnitude 22 earthquake21 the small table is a rough guide to the degrees of the mmi scale1722 the colours and descriptive names shown here differ from those used on certain shake maps in other articles dozens of intensityprediction equations23 have been published to estimate the macroseismic intensity at a location given the magnitude sourcetosite distance and perhaps other parameters eg local site conditions these are similar to ground motionprediction equations for the estimation of instrumental strongmotion parameters such as peak ground acceleration a summary of intensity prediction equations is available24 such equations can be used to estimate the seismic hazard in terms of macroseismic intensity which has the advantage of being related more closely to seismic risk than instrumental strongmotion parameters25 the mmi scale is not defined in terms of more rigorous objectively quantifiable measurements such as shake amplitude shake frequency peak velocity or peak acceleration humanperceived shaking and building damage are best correlated with peak acceleration for lowerintensity events and with peak velocity for higherintensity events26 the effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place so many mmi values may be measured for the same earthquake these values can be displayed best using a contoured map of equal intensity known as an isoseismal map however each earthquake has only one magnitude
