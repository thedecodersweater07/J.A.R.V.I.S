international incidents the munich massacre was a terrorist attack during the 1972 summer olympics in munich west germany carried out by eight members of the palestinian militant organisation black september the militants infiltrated the olympic village killed two members of the israeli olympic team and took nine other israeli team members hostage those hostages were later also killed by the militants during a failed rescue attempt3456 black september commander and negotiator luttif afif named the operation iqrit and biram789 after two palestinian christian villages whose inhabitants were expelled by israel during the 1948 palestine war101112 intelligence files suggest that some west german neonazis may have assisted black september in the 1972 munich massacre though the extent of their involvement remains debated13 shortly after the hostages were taken afif demanded the release of a significant number of palestinians and nonarab prisoners held in israel as well as one of the west germanimprisoned founders of the red army faction ulrike meinhof the list included 328 detainees14 west german police from the bavarian police ambushed the terrorists killing five of the eight black september members but the rescue attempt failed resulting in the deaths of all the hostages15 a west german police officer was also killed in the crossfire the west german government faced criticism for the rescue attempt and its handling of the incident the three surviving perpetrators were arrested but were released the following month in a hostage exchange after the hijacking of lufthansa flight 615 by then the israeli government had launched an assassination campaign which authorised mossad to track down and kill anyone who had played a role in the attack1617 two days before the start of the 2016 summer olympics brazilian and israeli officials led a ceremony where the international olympic committee ioc honoured the eleven israelis and one german killed at munich18 during the 2020 summer olympics a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony19 ahead of the 1972 olympics the west german olympic organizing committee aimed to discard germanys military image wary of the propaganda portrayed by the 1936 summer olympics under nazi dictator adolf hitler20 the ioc president at the time avery brundage had been involved in the 1936 olympics and had lived through the experience of those games security personnel known as olys were inconspicuous and primarily prepared to handle ticket fraud and drunkenness21 the documentary film one day in september claims that security in the athletes village was inadequate for the games athletes could bypass security and enter other countries rooms by climbing over the 2 m 6 ft 7 inhigh chainlink fence surrounding the olympic village rather than using the official entrances21 the absence of armed personnel worried israeli delegation head shmuel lalkin even before his team arrived in munich in later interviews with journalists serge groussard and aaron j klein lalkin said he had expressed concerns to the relevant authorities about his teams lodgings the team was housed in a relatively isolated part of the olympic village on the ground floor of a small building close to a gate which lalkin felt made them particularly vulnerable to an outside assault the west german authorities assured lalkin that extra security would be provided for the israeli team but lalkin doubts that any additional measures were taken21 olympic organisers asked west german forensic psychologist georg sieber de to present some threat scenarios to aid in planning security and he presented 26 scenarios20 his situation 21 scenario accurately predicted an incursion of palestinian elements into the olympic village20 however the organizers did not forward the document to the west german authorities as guarding the games against such threats conflicted with their goal of hosting carefree games without heavy security2021 despite having clear intelligence from multiple sources and technically considering the possibility of such an attack the bavarian state police were still taken by surprise20 the german news magazine der spiegel reported in 2012 that west german authorities had received a tipoff from a palestinian informant in beirut three weeks before the massacre22 the informant warned that palestinians were planning an incident at the olympic games and the federal foreign office in bonn took the tipoff seriously enough to pass it to the bavarian state secret service in munich urging that all possible security measures be taken22 according to der spiegel the authorities failed to act on the tip and never acknowledged it in the following 40 years22 the magazine claimed this was part of a 40year coverup by german authorities regarding their mishandling of the response to the massacre23 historical documents released to der spiegel by the german secret service show that dortmund police had been aware of collaboration between abu daoud and neonazi willi pohl aka e w pless and since 1979 officially named willi voss seven weeks before the attack24 the historian wolfgang kraushaar has suggested that the leftwing militant wilfried bse may have also provided support for the attack25 the attackers were reported to be palestinian terrorists from refugee camps in lebanon syria and jordan they were identified as luttif afif code name issa the leader three of issas brothers were also reportedly members of black september with two in israeli jails his deputy yusuf nazzal tony and junior members afif ahmed hamid paolo khalid jawad salah ahmed chic thaa abu halla mohammed safady badran adnan algashey denawi and algasheys cousin jamal algashey samir26 according to the author simon reeve afif nazzal and one of their confidantes had all worked in various capacities in the olympic village and had spent a couple of weeks scouting for their potential target a member of the uruguay olympic delegation which shared housing with the israelis claimed that he found nazzal inside 31 connollystrae less than 24 hours before the attack however since nazzal was recognized as a worker in the village nothing was thought of it at the time the other members of the group entered munich via train and plane in the days leading up to the attack on monday evening 4 september the israeli athletes enjoyed a night out watching a performance of fiddler on the roof and dining with the star of the play israeli actor shmuel rodensky before returning to the olympic park in munich27 on the return trip in the team bus lalkin denied his 13yearold sonwho had befriended weightlifter yossef romano and wrestler eliezer halfinpermission to spend the night in their olympic village apartment at connollystrae 31 a decision that may have saved the boys life28 the hostages were taken during the second week of the games at 410 am local time on 5 september2029 as the athletes slept eight tracksuitclad members of the black september faction of the palestine liberation organization carrying duffel bags loaded with akm assault rifles tokarev pistols and hand grenades scaled a 2metre 612 ft chainlink fence with the assistance of unsuspecting athletes who were also sneaking into the olympic village20 the athletes were originally identified as americans but were later claimed to be canadians30 they entered the twostory apartment building at connollystrae 31 which housed the israeli hong kong31 and uruguay olympic delegations through an unlocked front door29 yossef gutfreund a wrestling referee was awakened by a faint scratching noise at the door of apartment 1 which housed the israeli coaches and officials investigating the noise he saw the door begin to open and masked men with guns on the other side shouting a warning to his sleeping roommates he threw his 135 kg 300 lb weight against the door in an attempt to stop the intruders from forcing their way in29 gutfreunds actions gave his roommate weightlifting coach tuvia sokolovsky enough time to escape through a window29 meanwhile wrestling coach moshe weinberg known as muni fought the intruders32 who shot him through his cheek and then forced him to help them find more hostages2933 leading the intruders past apartment 2 weinberg lied telling them that the residents were not israelis instead he directed them to apartment 3 where the gunmen corralled six wrestlers and weightlifters as additional hostages weinberg might have hoped that the stronger men would have a better chance of fighting off the attackers than those in apartment 2 but they were all surprised in their sleep33 as the athletes from apartment 3 were marched back to the coaches apartment the wounded weinberg attacked the gunmen again allowing one of his wrestlers gad tsobari to escape via the underground parking garage34 weinberg knocked one of the intruders unconscious and slashed at another with a fruit knife but failed to draw blood before being shot to death35 weightlifter yossef romano a veteran of the 1967 sixday war also attacked and wounded one of the intruders before being shot and later succumbed to his wounds29 according to a report by the new york times on 1 december 2015 romano after he was shot was slowly left to bleed to death and at some point over many hours was castrated3637 the gunmen were left with nine hostages in addition to gutfreund they had shooting coach kehat shorr track and field coach amitzur shapira fencing master andre spitzer weightlifting judge yakov springer wrestlers eliezer halfin and mark slavin and weightlifters david berger and zeev friedman berger was an expatriate american with dual citizenship while slavin the youngest of the hostages at 18 had only arrived in israel from the soviet union four months before the olympic games began gutfreund physically the largest of the hostages was bound to a chair groussard describes him as being tied up like a mummy the rest were lined up four apiece on the two beds in springer and shapiras room and bound at the wrists and ankles and then to each other romanos bulletriddled corpse was left at his bound comrades feet as a warning several of the hostages were beaten during the standoff with some suffering broken bones as a result36 of the other members of the israeli team in apartment 2 racewalker shaul ladany was abruptly awakened by sports shooter zelig shtroch who said something like arabs have shot muni referring to moshe weinberg32 ladany escaped by jumping from the rear secondstory balcony he then ran to the american dormitory woke up us track coach bill bowerman and informed him of the attack383940 ladany a survivor of the bergenbelsen concentration camp was the first person to spread the alert38 the remaining four residents of apartment 2shooters henry hershkowitz and zelig shtroch and fencers dan alon and yehuda weisenstein32along with chef de mission shmuel lalkin and the two team doctors were also able to flee the besieged building the two female members of israels olympic team sprinter and hurdler esther shahamorov and swimmer shlomit nir were housed in a separate part of the olympic village the hostagetakers demanded the release of a significant number of palestinians and nonarabs imprisoned in israel including kz okamoto of the japanese red army along with one west german insurgent held by the west german penitentiary system ulrike meinhof who was one of the founders of the west german red army faction14 evidence uncovered in later years from the munich public prosecutors office held in the munich state archives revealed that the original typewritten englishlanguage communiqus of black september contained a list of 328 names14 the hostagetakers threw the body of weinberg out of the front door of the apartment building to demonstrate their resolve32 israels response was immediate and absolute there would be no negotiation israels official policy at the time was to refuse to negotiate with terrorists under any circumstances as according to the israeli government such negotiations would give an incentive to future attacks41 under chancellor willy brandt and federal interior minister hansdietrich genscher zvi zamir the head of israels mossad later reported the german authorities had rejected his repeated offer to deploy the idfs sayeret matkal insisting instead the bavarian state police would handle the crisis20414243 the bavarian interior minister bruno merk who headed the crisis centre jointly with genscher and munichs police chief manfred schreiber denies that such an israeli offer ever existed44 furthermore such an offer of foreign military intervention could never be entertained due to the sovereignty of the federal republic of germany according to journalist john k cooley the hostage situation presented an extremely difficult political situation for the germans because the hostages were jewish munich police chief manfred schreiber and bruno merk the interior minister of bavaria negotiated directly with the kidnappers repeatedly offering an unlimited ransom according to cooley the reply was that money means nothing to us our lives mean nothing to us the germans also offered the palestinians the substitution of highranking german officials the kidnappers refused both offers45 meanwhile the olympic committees refusal to suspend the games amid the emerging crisis intensified the pressure on the west german authorities and police to find a resolution20 magdi gohary and mohammad khadif both egyptian advisers to the arab league and ahmed el demerdash touny an egyptian member of the international olympic committee ioc also helped try to win concessions from the kidnappers but to no avail however the german negotiators were able to convince the terrorists that their demands were being considered as issa granted several deadline extensions29 elsewhere in the village athletes carried on as normal seemingly oblivious to the events unfolding nearby the games continued until mounting pressure on the ioc forced a suspension 12 hours after the first athlete had been murdered united states marathon runner frank shorter observing the unfolding events from the balcony of his nearby lodging was quoted as saying imagine those poor guys over there every five minutes a psycho with a machine gun says lets kill em now and someone else says no lets wait a while how long could you stand that46 shortly before 500 am the munich police the organising committee and paramedics were alerted14 ambulances arrived and the bloodsoaked body of weinberg who had been thrown in front of the apartment building entrance connollystrae 31 by the terrorists and could not be saved was recovered32 the paramedics also tried in vain to negotiate with the attackers at the building entrance to attend to the injured person inside romano despite their efforts the attackers would not allow them to enter the building and he eventually succumbed to his gunshot injuries the terrorists demanded by 9 am the release of palestinians and nonarabs held captive in israel as well as meinhof who was imprisoned in west germany14 they also requested safe passage for themselves and the hostages to an arab capital using a plane provided for this purpose where the hostage exchange would take place14 the terrorists warned that they would shoot the hostages immediately if their demands were not met14 there are different reports about the exact number of people to be released and whether nonarab terrorists were included for a long time there was talk of two hundred palestinians in nonfiction books by simon reeve luis palme and kay schiller it was stated from 2006 onwards without further source evidence that the hostagetakers had demanded the release of 234 palestinians from israeli custody as well as the german red army faction terrorists meinhof and andreas baader according to historians anna greithanner dominik aufleger and robert wolff who found the original list of the hostagetakers in the staatsarchiv mnchen munich state archives it contains 328 names including meinhof and okamoto of the japanese red army14 one of the perpetrators of the massacre at lod airport on 30 may 1972 various news reports and television documentaries had also claimed that the red army faction founder baader was listed along with meinhof but the original communiqu held in the munich state archives issued by the black september group to the west german government only listed meinhof not baader47 a copy of the initial communiqu shown in the movie one day in september shows meinhof baader and okamoto listed between 540 am and 9 am29 the crisis team was set up onsite and met with federal minister of the interior hansdietrich genscher bavarian minister of the interior bruno merk munich police president manfred schreiber state secretary erich kiesl german national olympic committee president willi daume and ioc president avery brundage while the cabinet met in bonn the crisis team was given full authorisation by chancellor willy brandt and the german federal government to do whatever was needed to rescue the hostages29 at 845 am the israeli foreign ministry received the initial news about the attack from the israeli embassy in bonn this information was then forwarded to prime minister golda meir minister of education and culture yigal allon who had responsibility for the olympic team and minister of defence moshe dayan41 as the ultimatum neared its expiry the crisis team resumed negotiations with the germanspeaking leader of the terrorists issa who hid his face under a mask and wore a white hat14 with the assistance of an envoy from the arab league and the head of the egyptian ioc delegation they managed to extend the ultimatum that evening at the press center mark spitzs first postcompetition press conference was held rather than ask about his performance reporters questioned him about his reaction to the ongoing hostage situationnote 1 spitz himself of jewish origin was advised by officials to leave munich the same day48 a quarter of an hour before the noon ultimatum expired an extension of three hours until 3 pm was negotiated with the terrorists during the negotiations the mayor of the olympic village walther trger along with willi daume manfred schreiber the munich police president and the head of security for the games of the xx olympiad bavarian minister of the interior bruno merk and federal minister of the interior and vice president of the german noc hansdietrich genscher offered themselves to the terrorists as replacement hostages but to no avail14 the israeli ambassador to germany eliashiv benhorin announced around midday that the israeli cabinet had decided not to accept the demands of the hostagetakers14 meir rejected the demands in order not to risk the lives of its citizens abroad for all time14 ambassador ben horin underscored israels faith in the german authorities ability to save the hostages and demanded that the sporting competitions be halted until the hostagetaking was concluded1441 at one point during the crisis the german negotiators demanded direct contact with the hostages to satisfy themselves the israelis were still alive fencing coach andre spitzer who spoke fluent german and shooting coach kehat shorr the senior member of the israeli delegation had a brief conversation with west german officials while standing at the secondfloor window of the besieged building with two kidnappers holding guns on them when spitzer attempted to answer a question he was clubbed with the butt of an ak47 in full view of international television cameras and pulled away from the window32 at 325 pm the ultimatum was postponed to 5 pm14 by 338 pm the olympic games were suspended after allowing ongoing competitions to be completed the terrorists repeatedly changed their clothes and appeared on the balcony with their number estimated at five meanwhile the terrorists learned from radio and television broadcasts that the police were approaching and had planned a rescue operation29 the authorities had failed to cut off the terrorists electricity and remove the press from the olympic village in the early 1970s counterterrorism and tactical policing were largely unheardof methods for combating terrorism and no military force worldwide had a unit specifically trained for managing hostage crises20 in west germany the absence of specialised units in the modern sense meant that such responsibilities were reactive and improvised measures falling under the remit of ordinary law enforcement agencies although special military combat units existed within the bundeswehr their combatant status under the postworld war ii german constitution prohibited their deployment for internal operations during peacetime as a result these duties fell within the jurisdiction of the regional state and municipal police20 the ensuing events in munich would mark a critical juncture compelling governments to recognise terrorism as a persistent security challenge and address it with diverse resources20 by 430 pm a hastily improvised team of 13 west german police officers who had signed a declaration to willingly participate in a bold and risky hostage rescue operation could be seen scaling the building in the olympic village4950 awkwardly disguised in olympic training suits wearing heavy bulletproof vests beneath and carrying walther mp submachine guns they were thought to be members of the german federal border guard4950 according to former munich police officer heinz hohensinn49 who was a lead officer einsatzleiter and part of the police assault operation on the ground they were regular munich police officers from the bavarian state police with no experience in counterterrorism or hostage rescue2049 quoting hohensinn they realised from the onset that the bulletproof vests would not withstand the russian ammunition the terrorists were using49 the police officers were also informed and had signed a declaration that they had to return the olympic training suits the next day washed and cleaned despite not knowing if they would survive or what was about to confront them49 they planned to crawl down from the ventilation shafts and overpower the terrorists the police officers took up positions awaiting the codeword sunshine which upon hearing they were to begin the assault in the meantime camera crews filmed the actions of the police officers from nearby apartments in the olympic village and broadcast the images live on television49 this allowed the terrorists to watch the police prepare for the attack and hear it on the radio49 a press image shows one of the terrorists peering from the balcony dooran image that became worldfamouswhile an armed police officer stood on the roof less than 12 m 40 ft away51 after issa threatened to kill some of the hostages and the police cover had been blown by the television coverage the police were forced to suspend the rescue operation to avoid a bloodbath and retreated from the premises4952 the press were also removed from the olympic village shortly before the 5 pm deadline the terrorists demanded safe passage for themselves and the hostages on a plane to cairo where they intended to continue negotiations for the prisoners release14 to verify the hostages were still alive minister genscher and walter trger the mayor of the olympic village were briefly allowed into the apartments to speak with the hostages clearly in fear for their lives they agreed to fly to the egyptian capital with the terrorists29 trger noticed that several of the hostages especially gutfreund showed signs of having suffered physical abuse at the hands of the terrorists and that david berger had been shot in his left shoulder trger spoke of being very moved by the dignity with which the israelis held themselves and that they seemed resigned to their fate43 while being debriefed by the crisis team genscher and trger reported seeing five terrorists inside the apartment29 fatefully this number rather than eight was accepted as definitive as a sovereign state the federal republic of germany could not tolerate the hostagetakers forcibly transporting foreign guests to another territory at gunpoint14 moreover none of the arab states supported the diplomatic efforts of brandt consequently no agreement was reached as they did not want to be involved in the situation29 a feigned agreement had been reached the terrorists from black september and their nine israeli hostages were to be flown out of the munich olympic village by helicopter to an awaiting aircraft at frstenfeldbruck airbase it was only through this manoeuvre that they were able to extend the ultimatum to 7 pm from 6 pm schreibers deputy georg wolf and five police officers began preparing for a potential operation in frstenfeldbruck airbase knowing it would be their last option for freeing the hostages29 the west german plan was to deceptively offer to transport the terrorists and the hostages by plane to cairo2915 two bell uh1 helicopters from the federal border guard were assigned to take them to nearby frstenfeldbruck a west german air force nato airbase initially the perpetrators planned to go to munichriem airport which was the international airport near munich at the time but the german negotiators convinced them that frstenfeldbruck would be more practical the operation in frstenfeldbruck was designed as an alternative to one in the olympic village29 georg wolf schreibers deputy who later led the police team in frstenfeldbruck advocated to the crisis team for freeing the hostages at the frstenfeldbruck airbase29 this location was advantageous because the west german police could arrive before the hostagetakers and set up the operation being a military airbase it could be easily cleared ensuring no external parties would be at risk during a shootout29 a plan was devised to walk the palestinians and israelis through the basement garage of the olympic village to the helicopters the west german police saw an opportunity to ambush the terrorists and positioned sharpshooters in the garage basement29 however at 830 pm issa insisted on checking the route first from connollystrae 31 to the helicopters29 he became suspicious and demanded to travel the entire route from munich to frstenfeldbruck by bus29 the german negotiators did not agree to this as the entire route could not be adequately secured29 eventually the crisis team and the hostagetakers agreed to transport the group by bus to the helicopters thus the plan to free the hostages in the basement garage of the olympic village had failed29 the terrorists wanted to first check the transport that would drive them the 400 m 1300 ft to the helicopters and requested it be brought to the basement garage jrgen kuhr a soldier and driver in a transport squadron with the air transport wing 63 of the german air force was assigned along with five colleagues and four civilian drivers to provide transport during the games for athletes visitors officials and security personnel using two mercedes minibuses with a total of 22 seats between them in the evening they received a request for one of the minibuses to go to the basement garage kuhr volunteered because he was single while his colleague on the other bus was married with children at 903 pm kuhr made his way he was instructed to drive the minibus to the underground garage with exterior lights off and interior lights on and wait53 moments later he met issa who was carrying a weapon issa didnt check kuhr for weapons and even reassured him by saying in german that he had nothing to fear and only wanted to inspect the bus after issa checked the bus with a torch he found it too small and told kuhr he could drive away the encounter lasted two minutes the hostagetakers and hostages later boarded a larger bus from the basement garage to the helicopters an event that was filmed live and captured by news photographers2953 the crisis team made a final attempt to buy time by announcing that no plane was available for the flight to cairo which extended the ultimatum to 9 pm this deadline also passed29 at 936 pm the lufthansa plane was ready at frstenfeldbruck and wolf then flew back to the airbase at 943 pm with five police officers29 by 1006 pm the heavily armed hostagetakers led the bound hostages onto the bus that transported them to the helicopters after a brief inspection issa ordered the israeli athletes to board them with four hostagetakers sitting next to the hostages in each helicopter29 police chief schreiber discovered the exact number of hostagetakers when they boarded the helicopters realising there were eight instead of the previously believed five29 he did not relay this information to frstenfeldbruck airbase assuming the operations team was already aware29 the first helicopter to arrive carrying crisis team members advisors and two israeli security experts landed at frstenfeldbruck airbase29 this helicopter was separate from the two others carrying the hostagetakers and hostages that would arrive shortly after five west german police officers were deployed around the airbase in sniper roles29 from behind the cover provided by the balustrade of the control tower platform sniper no 3 supported by an observer was positioned with a field of fire to the east29 sniper no 4 had a field of fire to the northeast while sniper no 5 was at the northeast corner of the platform with a field of fire to the east but could also fire north29 sniper no 1 along with an observer was positioned behind a fire engine to the side of and at a distance from the switchyard on the grass area beyond the runway northeast of the control tower with a field of fire in all directions29 sniper no 2 was positioned behind the low concrete square frame surrounding the switchyard with a field of fire to the southeast the field of fire was intensely illuminated with airbase mast lighting designed to enhance the snipers accuracy and blind the hostagetakers29 however none of them had any sniper training or special weapons29 being equipped with the hk g3 the standardissue battle rifle of the german armed forces without telescopic sights or night vision devices the officers were chosen due to their performance in shooting exercises29 at that time the munich police had already acquired the relatively new steyr ssg 69 sniper rifles in their inventory but no precision shooters had been trained to use them the members of the crisis teamschreiber genscher merk and schreibers deputy georg wolfsupervised and observed the attempted rescue from the airbase control tower ulrich wegener a liaison officer from the german federal border guard mossad chief zamir and victor cohen from the israel security agency were also present41 but the german authorities strictly limited the two israelis to observing29 a fully fuelled lufthansa boeing 727 aircraft was positioned on the tarmac east of the airbase control tower with its engines running the plan was to have the police officers involved in the earlier assault attempt disguised as flight crew inside49 it was agreed that issa and tony would inspect the plane the police officers would then overpower them as they boarded giving the snipers a chance to eliminate the remaining terrorists at the helicopters29 however the police officers arriving by car with blue lights flashing were initially hampered by airbase security and informed they were not authorised to allow anyone onto the airfield49 the officers took cover in a ditch and could see the aircraft with engines running loudly 150 metres 490 ft away49 heinz hohensinn one of the lead police officers then received a radio message to proceed to the aircraft and was informed of the plan49 in the complete helplessness of the situation he learned they were to disguise themselves as flight crew board the aircraft and conduct the assault inside49 however he rejected the idea as a certain failure49 he believed the terrorists would not board the aircraft like a goose march and if they realised that it was an ambush and that they would not be flown out the outcome with a fully fuelled aircraft would be disastrous49 during the final moments as the two federal border guard helicopters approached frstenfeldbruck airbase with the terrorists and hostages on board the west german police officers assigned to board the awaiting 727 aircraft decided it was too dangerous due to inadequate security precautions29 they were illequipped and poorly protected inside the aircraft resolving to abandon their mission2949 this left only the five police sharpshooters to try to overpower a larger and more heavily armed group wolf could not adjust the operation plan as the two helicopters with the hostagetakers and hostages were already approaching frstenfeldbruck29 at that point oberleutnant ulrich wegener hansdietrich genschers federal border guard liaison officer at the federal ministry of the interior remarked im sure this will blow the whole affair43 wegener who later founded and commanded the elite german counterterrorism intervention unit gsg 9 had an incredulous exchange with genscher only hours earlier regarding the actions of the munich and bavarian police preparing to ambush the terrorists in the olympic village apartment54 at around 435 pm wegener had remarked in consternation to his boss genscher this contradicts all basic tactical rules to which genscher replied many of the police know nothing about this54 the helicopters landed next to each other just after 1030 pm29 and the four pilots got out first as previously agreed with the operations team they opened the doors to the passenger compartments where the hostagetakers and the hostages were the operational plan called for the pilots to then head north to avoid coming under fire but two of the hostagetakers had already exited and prevented them from doing so meanwhile operations manager wolf was lying on the roof of the airbase tower still unaware of the exact number of hostagetakers additionally the helicopters rotor blades cast large shadows providing cover for the hostagetakers this crucial detail had not been considered during daylight planning29 while two of the hostagetakers threatened the pilots at gunpoint their leader issa went to inspect the 727 aircraft immediately after landing with tony the second leader following at a distance wolf decided to first free the four pilots from their dangerous situation two police snipers took positions on the northern balustrade of the tower and targeted the hostagetakers threatening the pilots only after they fired would the third sniper on the airbase tower open fire on issa and tony however the order to fire was delayed because the pilots were in the line of fire meanwhile issa and tony had arrived at the 727 aircraft realising there were no personnel on board they recognised the trap and immediately sprinted back to the helicopters29 only when issa and tony had almost reached the eastern helicopter did the police snipers simultaneously shoot at the two hostagetakers threatening the pilots both fell to the ground unable to use their weapons the pilots tried to get to safety with one fleeing behind the low wall of the switchyard where he encountered a police sniper the third sniper on the airbase tower had already targeted issa and tony and was waiting for the first shot however when he opened fire he could no longer hit them from his position the two snipers on the tower who had already shot at the hostagetakers near the helicopters turned and aimed at issa and tony although issa was hit in the leg he managed to hide with tony in the shadow of the eastern helicopters rotor blades from where they kept the upper part of the airbase tower under constant fire the two snipers positioned on the ground were barely able to intervene in the exchange of fire due to their positions to the east and north of the helicopters after the first shots were fired one of the hostagetakers lay behind the rear of the western helicopter pretending to be dead until he was arrested29 over the next hour shots were repeatedly fired as the tense standoff continued police chief schreiber had instructed officer anton fliegerbauer and two colleagues to provide fire support for the snipers positioned on the airfield29 armed with standard policeissue 6shot walther pp sidearms one spare magazine each and one radio between them they had taken up positions crouched behind a wall at the foot of the frstenfeldbruck airbase control tower directly across from where the two helicopters landed42 amid the gunfire fliegerbauers team leader zugfhrer arved semerak recalls standing 20 m 66 ft away when fliegerbauer was fatally hit by a stray bullet from the hostagetakers2942 in the chaos semerak did not notice what had happened until paramedics began attending to fliegerbauer42 the bullet struck the side of his head killing him2642 due to the danger to the police officers lives wolf felt it was unjustifiable to risk freeing the hostages who might still be alive he decided to wait for the police armoured personnel carriers requested from the olympic village before attempting another assault however these vehicles had only been ordered to frstenfeldbruck airbase ten minutes after the first shots were fired onlookers had flocked to the scene in droves blocking traffic29 meanwhile israeli security expert cohen grabbed a megaphone and addressed the members of black september in arabic surrender save your lives the response was a hail of bullets29 around 1150 pm six mowag mr 8 police armoured personnel carriers which had been held up in traffic arrived from munich they were tasked with rescuing the injured and providing protection for police officers approaching the helicopters as wolf drove towards the helicopters in an armoured personnel carrier he was shot at one of the hostagetakers threw a hand grenade into the eastern helicopter and attempted to flee towards the switchyard but was shot by a police sniper the grenade detonated setting the helicopter ablaze david berger died in the helicopter from smoke inhalation the other eight hostages had already been shot by the hostagetakers yossef gutfreund kehat shorr mark slavin andre spitzer and amitzur shapira in the western helicopter and yakov springer eliezer halfin zeev friedman and david berger in the eastern one29 more police armoured personnel carriers arrived on the airbase the arriving police officers confused by the situation mistakenly shot at a police sniper and the helicopter pilot at the switchyard thinking they were hostagetakers both were injured five hostagetakers including the leaders issa and tony had been shot dead by the west german police three hostagetakers survived the exchange of fire by pretending to be dead and were arrested jamal algashey had been shot through his right wrist43 mohammed safady had sustained a flesh wound to his leg55 and adnan algashey had escaped injury completely almost 90 minutes had passed since the helicopters had landed by around midnight on 6 september the battle was over the operation had failed none of the hostages were rescued29 a time magazine reconstruction of the longsuppressed bavarian prosecutors report indicates that a third hostagetaker reeve identifies him as adnan algashey stood at the door of the western helicopter and raked the remaining five hostages with machine gun fire gutfreund shorr slavin spitzer and shapira were shot an average of four times each2155 of the four hostages in the eastern helicopter only zeev friedmans body was relatively intact he had been blown clear of the helicopter by the explosion in some cases the exact cause of death for the hostages in the eastern helicopter was difficult to establish because the rest of the corpses were burned almost beyond recognition in the explosion and subsequent fire43 between 1130 pm and midnight conrad ahlers de spoke as a spokesperson for the german government in several tv interviews50 despite the ongoing attempt to rescue the israeli team he described it based on the information he had received as a fortunate and successful operation50 initial news reports published all over the world indicated that all the hostages were alive and that all the attackers had been killed only later did a representative for the ioc suggest that initial reports were overly optimistic at 255 am israels ambassador in bonn benhorin reported that he had received information that all the hostages had been killed and at 310 am mossads chief zamir confirmed this information41 at 317 am reuters issued a corrected breaking news story all israeli hostages captured by arab guerrillas are dead29 jim mckay who was covering the olympics that year for the american broadcasting company abc had taken on the job of reporting the events as roone arledge fed them into his earpiece at 324 am mckay received the official confirmation when i was a kid my father used to say our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized our worst fears have been realized tonight theyve now said that there were eleven hostages two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning nine were killed at the airport tonight theyre all gone56 several sources listed ladany as having been killed57 ladany recalled later the impact did not hit me at the time when we were in munich it was when we arrived back in israel at the airport in lod there was a huge crowdmaybe 20000 peopleand each one of us the survivors stood by one of the coffins on the runway some friends came up to me and tried to kiss me and hug me as if i was almost a ghost that came back alive it was then that i really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me57 the shootout with the welltrained black september members underscored a significant lack of preparation by the german authorities they were illequipped to handle such an unprecedented threat previously unknown in germany20 there was no single authority overseeing the situation the munich police bavarian authorities west german authorities and even the olympic committee all intervened which increased the confusion and difficulty in handling the crisis20 german authorities faced several critical constraints first due to restrictions in the postwar west german constitution the army could not participate in the attempted rescue as the german armed forces were not allowed to operate inside germany during peacetime20 the responsibility fell entirely on the munich police and the bavarian authorities2058 the munich massacre was a critical juncture prompting governments to think about terrorism as an enduring challenge to security international and domestic and to respond to it with a wide range of government resources20 this led directly to the founding of the german federal border guards counterterrorism intervention unit gsg 9 less than two weeks later20 it was known half an hour before the hostages and kidnappers arrived at frstenfeldbruck airbase that the number of kidnappers was larger than initially believed despite this new information schreiber decided to proceed with the rescue operation as originally planned the new information could not reach the police snipers because they had no radios59 it is a basic tenet of sniping operations that there are enough snipers at least two for each known target or in this case a minimum of ten deployed to neutralise as many of the attackers as possible with the first volley of shots60 the 2006 national geographic channels seconds from disaster profile on the massacre stated that the helicopters were supposed to land sideways and to the west of the control tower which would have allowed the snipers clear shots into them as the kidnappers threw open the helicopter doors instead the helicopters landed facing the control tower and at the centre of the airstrip this not only gave them a place to hide after the gunfight began but put snipers 1 and 2 in the line of fire of the other three snipers on the control tower according to the same programme the crisis committee responsible for making decisions on how to handle the incident consisted of bruno merk the bavarian interior minister hansdietrich genscher the west german interior minister and manfred schreiber munichs chief of police the program mentioned that a year before the games schreiber had participated in another hostage crisis a failed bank robbery where he ordered a sharpshooter to shoot one of the perpetrators but only managed to wound the robber as a result the robbers shot an innocent woman dead schreiber was consequently charged with involuntary manslaughter the five police snipers lacked radio contact with each other and the german authorities conducting the rescue operation making it impossible to coordinate their fire their only contact with the operational leadership was through georg wolf schreibers deputy who was lying next to the three snipers on the control tower giving them direct orders61 the two snipers at ground level received vague instructions to shoot when the other snipers began firing and were left to fend for themselves62 the police snipers did not have the proper equipment for this hostage rescue operation the g3 rifles used were considered by several experts to be inadequate for the distance at which the snipers were trying to shoot the g3 the standard service rifle of the bundeswehr at that time had a 460millimetre 18 in barrel at the distances the snipers were required to shoot a 690millimetre 27 in barrel would have ensured far greater accuracy63 none of the rifles were equipped with telescopic or night vision sights64 additionally none of the snipers were equipped with a steel helmet or bulletproof vest64 no armoured vehicles were at the scene at frstenfeldbruck airbase and were only called in after the gunfight was well underway65 there were also numerous tactical errors sniper 2 who was stationed behind the switchyard was directly in the line of fire of his fellow snipers on the control tower without any protective gear and without any other police officer being aware of his location64 because of this sniper 2 did not fire any shots until late in the gunfight when hostagetaker khalid jawad attempted to escape on foot and ran at the exposed sniper sniper 2 killed the fleeing perpetrator but was in turn badly wounded by a fellow police officer who was unaware that he was shooting at one of his own men one of the helicopter pilots gunnar ebel was lying near sniper 2 and was also wounded by friendly fire both ebel and the sniper recovered from their injuries66 many of the errors made by the german authorities during the rescue attempt were detailed by leading police officer heinz hohensinn who had participated in operation sunshine earlier that day49 in one day in september he stated that he had also been directed to pose as a flight crew member in the second assault plan involving the 727 aircraft49 he and his fellow police officers who had volunteered to undertake the hostage rescue operation during the first assault attempt in the olympic village understood the second assault plan to be a suicide mission consequently the group unanimously resolved to abandon the second assault plan in the 72749 none of them were reprimanded67 on 20 september the west german report was published it examined three key aspects security measures in munich and the olympic village efforts to release the hostages without force and the police operation at the olympic village and frstenfeldbruck airbase the report noted warnings of potential terrorist attacks during the olympics though none specifically targeted israelis it described contacts with israeli representatives about the security of the israeli olympic team indicating no dissatisfaction with the arrangements the authors concluded that given the terrorists intent even significant security reinforcements would not have prevented the attack on the israelis41 the second section reviewed the efforts to release the hostages concluding that a rescue without force or flying them to cairo was impossible partly due to israels refusal to release palestinian prisoners the third section examined the airbase operation raising operational questions but finding no fault with the police the bundestag interior committee adopted these conclusions resulting in no disciplinary actions or removals41 the significant differences between the israeli and german assessments of the operation led to a wave of claims and counterclaims following the release of reports by mossad chief zamir and the german authorities the israeli foreign ministry summarised these differences highlighting major discrepancies between the west german report and the comments by zamir and benhorin directorgeneral mordechai gazit sent this summary to meir41 on 22 september zamir also reported to the knesset foreign affairs and defence committee he explained that while the west german authorities had a plan and were fully committed to rescuing the hostages they struggled to improvise and adapt to the unfolding events this inability to find solutions as the events were occurring partially contributed to the operations failure41 the bodies of the five palestinian attackersafif nazzal chic thaa hamid and jawad were delivered to libya where they received heroes funerals and were buried with full military honours68 on 8 september israeli planes bombed ten plo bases in syria and lebanon in response to the massacre killing a reported 200 militants and 11 civilians6970 the three surviving black september gunmen had been arrested and were being held in a munich prison for trial on 29 october lufthansa flight 615 was hijacked and threatened to be blown up if the munich attackers were not released safady and the algasheys were immediately released by west germany receiving a tumultuous welcome when they touched down in libya and as seen in one day in september giving their own firsthand account of their operation at a press conference broadcast worldwide167172 further international investigations into the lufthansa flight 615 incident have produced theories of a secret agreement between the german government and black september on the release of the surviving terrorists in exchange for assurances of no further attacks on germany7374 in the wake of the hostagetaking competition was suspended for 34 hours for the first time in modern olympic history75 after public criticism of the iocs decision to continue the games on 6 september a memorial service attended by 80000 spectators and 3000 athletes was held in the olympic stadium ioc president avery brundage made little reference to the murdered athletes during a speech praising the strength of the olympic movement and equating the attack on the israeli sportsmen with the recent arguments about encroaching professionalism and disallowing rhodesias participation in the games which outraged many listeners76 the victims families were represented by andre spitzers widow ankie moshe weinbergs mother and a cousin of weinberg carmel eliash during the memorial service eliash collapsed from a heart attack77 many of the 80000 people who filled the olympic stadium for west germanys football match with hungary carried noisemakers and waved flags but when several spectators unfurled a banner reading 17 dead already forgotten security officers removed the sign and expelled those responsible from the grounds21 during the memorial service the olympic flag was flown at halfmast along with the flags of most of the other competing nations at the request of brandt ten arab nations objected to their flags flying at halfmast and the mandate was rescinded78 willi daume president of the munich organizing committee initially sought to cancel the remainder of the games but in the afternoon brundage and others who wished to continue the games prevailed stating that they could not let the incident halt the games21 brundage stated the games must go on and we must and we must continue our efforts to keep them clean pure and honest79 the decision was endorsed by the israeli government and israeli olympic team chef de mission shmuel lalkin80 on 6 september after the memorial service the remaining members of the israeli team withdrew from the games and left munich all jewish sportsmen were placed under guard mark spitz the american swimming star who had already completed his competitions left munich during the hostage crisis it was feared that as a prominent jew he might be a kidnapping target the egyptian team left the games on 7 september stating they feared reprisals81 the philippine and algerian teams also left the games as did some members of the dutch and norwegian teams american marathon runner kenny moore who wrote about the incident for sports illustrated quoted dutch distance runner jos hermens as saying its quite simple we were invited to a party and if someone comes to the party and shoots people how can you stay82 dutch sprinter wilma van gool had qualified for the semifinals in the 200 m sprint the time that she ran in the quarterfinals was faster than the time of the eventual gold medal winner renate stecher of east germany83 she withdrew from the competition in sympathy with the israeli victims84 she said that she was leaving in protest of the obscene decision to continue with the olympic games85 four years later at the 1976 summer olympics in montreal the israeli team commemorated the massacre when they entered the stadium at the opening ceremony their national flag was adorned with a black ribbon the families of some victims have asked the ioc to establish a permanent memorial to the athletes the ioc has declined saying that introducing a specific reference to the victims could alienate other members of the olympic community according to the bbc86 alex gilady an israeli ioc official told the bbc we must consider what this could do to other members of the delegations that are hostile to israel the ioc rejected an international campaign in support of a minute of silence at the opening ceremony of the 2012 london olympics in honour of the israeli victims on the 40th anniversary of the massacre8788 jacques rogge the ioc president said it would be inappropriate although the opening ceremony included a memorial for the victims of the 7 july 2005 london bombings89 speaking of the decision olympian shaul ladany who survived the attack commented i do not understand i do not understand and i do not accept it16 in 2014 the ioc agreed to contribute 250000 towards a memorial to the murdered israeli athletes90 after 44 years91 the ioc commemorated the victims of the munich massacre for the first time in the rio 2016 olympic village on 4 august 201692 there is a memorial to those who died outside the olympic stadium in munich in the form of a stone tablet at the bridge linking the stadium to the former olympic village and a memorial tablet outside the front door of their former lodging at 31 connollystrae on 15 october 1999 almost a year before the sydney 2000 games a memorial plaque was unveiled in one of the large light towers tower 14 outside the sydney olympic stadium9394 in the 2020 summer olympics a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony in 2021 a year before its 50th anniversary this was the first time in history this happened in the opening ceremony19 in 2024 adidas launched an ad campaign for retro sneakers inspired by a model from the 1972 munich olympics featuring bella hadid known for her propalestinian activism the campaign faced criticism from various groups due to hadids controversial remarks prompting adidas to issue an apology the company acknowledged the unintended connection to tragic events and announced plans to revise the campaign9596 on 5 september 2024 the 52nd anniversary of the massacre shots were fired at the israeli consulate in munich979899 king hussein of jordan the only leader of an arab country to denounce the attack publicly called it a savage crime against civilization perpetrated by sick minds45 us president richard nixon privately discussed several possible american responses such as declaring a national day of mourning favoured by secretary of state william p rogers or having nixon fly to the athletes funerals nixon and us national security advisor henry kissinger decided instead to press the united nations to take steps against international terrorism100 on 5 september meir appealed to other countries to save our citizens and condemn the unspeakable criminal acts committed she also stated if we israel should give in then no israeli anywhere in the world shall feel that his life is safe its blackmail of the worst kind101 meir and the israeli defence committee secretly authorized mossad to track down and kill those allegedly responsible for the munich massacre102 zamir described the mission as putting an end to the type of terror that was perpetrated in europe103 mossad set up several special teams to locate and kill these fedayeen aided by the agencys stations in europe104 in a february 2006 interview103 zamir answered direct questions was there no element of vengeance in the decision to take action against the terrorists no we were not engaged in vengeance we are accused of having been guided by a desire for vengeance that is nonsense what we did was to concretely prevent in the future we acted against those who thought that they would continue to perpetrate acts of terror i am not saying that those who were involved in munich were not marked for death they definitely deserved to die but we were not dealing with the past we concentrated on the future did you not receive a directive from golda meir along the lines of take revenge on those responsible for munich golda meir abhorred the necessity that was imposed on us to carry out the operations golda never told me to take revenge on those who were responsible for munich no one told me that103 the israeli mission later became known as operation wrath of god or mivtza zaam hael43 reeve quotes general aharon yarivwho he writes was the general overseer of the operationas stating that after munich the israeli government felt it had no alternative but to exact justice we had no choice we had to make them stop and there was no other way we are not very proud about it but it was a question of sheer necessity we went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye i approach these problems not from a moral point of view but hard as it may sound from a costbenefit point of view if im very hardheaded i can say what is the political benefit in killing this person will it bring us nearer to peace will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the palestinians or not in most cases i dont think it will but in the case of black september we had no other choice and it worked is it morally acceptable one can debate that question is it politically vital it was43 benny morris writes that a target list was created using information from turned plo personnel and friendly european intelligence services once completed a wave of assassinations of suspected black september operatives began across europe on 9 april 1973 israel launched operation spring of youth a joint mossadidf operation in beirut the targets were mohammad yusuf alnajjar abu yusuf head of fatahs intelligence arm which ran black september according to morris kamal adwan who headed the plos western sector which controlled plo action inside israel and kamal nassir the plo spokesman a group of sayeret matkal commandos was taken in nine missile boats and a small fleet of patrol boats to a deserted lebanese beach before driving in two cars to downtown beirut where they killed najjar adwan and nassir two further detachments of commandos blew up the pflps headquarters in beirut and a fatah explosives plant on 21 july 1973 in the lillehammer affair a team of mossad agents mistakenly killed ahmed bouchiki a moroccan man unrelated to the munich attack in lillehammer norway105 after an informant mistakenly said bouchiki was ali hassan salameh the head of force 17 and a black september operative five mossad agents including two women were captured by the norwegian authorities while others managed to slip away102 the five were convicted of the killing and imprisoned but were released and returned to israel in 1975 mossad later found ali hassan salameh in beirut and killed him on 22 january 1979 with a remotecontrolled car bomb the attack killed four passersby and injured 18 others106 according to cia officer duane dewey claridge chief of operations of the cia near east division from 1975 to 1978 in mid1976 salameh offered americans assistance and protection with arafats blessings during the american embassy pullout from beirut during the lebanese civil war there was a general feeling that americans could be trusted however the cooperation ended abruptly after the assassination of salameh americans were generally blamed as israels principal benefactors107 simon reeve writes that the israeli operations continued for more than twenty years he details the assassination in paris in 1992 of atef bseiso the plos head of intelligence and says that an israeli general confirmed there was a link back to munich reeve also writes that while israeli officials have stated operation wrath of god was intended to exact vengeance for the families of the athletes killed in munich few relatives wanted such a violent reckoning with the palestinians reeve states the families were instead desperate to know the truth of the events surrounding the munich massacre reeve outlines what he sees as a lengthy coverup by german authorities to hide the truth43 after a lengthy court fight in 2004 the families of the munich victims reached a settlement of 3 million with the german government an article in 2012 in a frontpage story of the german news magazine der spiegel reported that much of the information on the mishandling of the massacre was covered up by the german authorities20 for twenty years germany refused to release any information about the attack and did not accept responsibility for the results the magazine reported that the government had been hiding 3808 files which contained tens of thousands of documents der spiegel said it obtained secret reports by authorities embassy cables and minutes of cabinet meetings that demonstrate the lack of professionalism of the german officials in handling the massacre the newspaper also wrote that the german authorities were told that palestinians were planning an incident at the olympics three weeks before the massacre but failed to take the necessary security measures and these facts are missing from the official documentation of the german government22108109110 in august 2012 der spiegel reported that following the massacre the west german government began secret meetings with black september due to the fear that they would carry out other terrorist attacks in germany the government proposed a clandestine meeting between german foreign minister walter scheel and a member of black september to create a new basis of trust in return for an exchange of the political status of the plo the plo would stop terrorist attacks on german soil when french police arrested abu daoud one of the chief organizers of the munich massacre and inquired about extraditing him to germany bavarias justice secretary alfred seidl de recommended that germany should not take any action causing the french to release abu daoud and the assad regime to shelter him until he died at a damascus hospital in 2010111 two of the three surviving gunmen mohammed safady and adnan algashey were allegedly killed by mossad as part of operation wrath of god algashey was allegedly located after making contact with a cousin in a gulf state and safady was found by remaining in touch with family in lebanon112 this account was challenged in a book by aaron j klein who claims that algashey died of heart failure in the 1970s and that safady was killed by christian phalangists in lebanon in the early 1980s in july 2005 plo veteran tawfiq tirawi told klein that safady whom tirawi claimed as a close friend was as alive as you are21113 in 2022 a man claiming to be and closely resembling safady was interviewed for a german documentary about the 50th anniversary of the massacre the third surviving gunman jamal algashey was known to be alive as of 1999 hiding in north africa or syria claiming to still fear retribution from israel he is the only one of the surviving terrorists to consent to interviews since 1972 having granted an interview in 1992 to a palestinian newspaper and having briefly emerged from hiding in 1999 to participate in an interview for the film one day in september during which he was disguised and his face shown only in blurry shadow114 of those believed to have planned the massacre only abu daoud the man who claimed that the attack was his idea is known to have died of natural causes in january 1977 abu daoud was intercepted by french police in paris while travelling from beirut under an assumed name115 under protest from the plo iraq and libya who claimed that because daoud was travelling to a plo comrades funeral he should receive diplomatic immunity the french government refused a west german extradition request on grounds that forms had not been filled in properly and put him on a plane to algeria before germany could submit another request115 daoud was allowed safe passage through israel in 1996 so he could attend a plo meeting in the gaza strip to rescind an article in its charter that called for israels eradication21 in his autobiography from jerusalem to munich first published in france in 1999 and later in a written interview with sports illustrated116 daoud wrote that funds for munich were provided by mahmoud abbas chairman of the plo since 11 november 2004 and president of the palestinian national authority since 15 january 2005117 though he claims he didnt know what the money was being spent for longtime fatah official mahmoud abbas aka abu mazen was responsible for the financing of the munich attack118 daoud believed that if the israelis knew that mahmoud abbas was the financier of the operation the 1993 oslo accords would not have been achieved during which mahmoud abbas was seen at the white house116 ankie spitzer the widow of fencing coach and munich victim andre declined several offers to meet with abu daoud saying that the only place she wants to meet him is in a courtroom according to spitzer he abu daoud didnt pay the price for what he did119 in 2006 during the release of steven spielbergs film munich der spiegel interviewed daoud regarding the munich massacre he was quoted as saying i regret nothing you can only dream that i would apologize120 daoud died of kidney failure on 3 july 2010 in damascus syria121 fliegerbauer was born in westerndorf lower bavaria and grew up on a farm with his two siblings he initially attended agricultural school before taking up an apprenticeship with the bavarian state police in 1963122 in 1964 he met his future wife whom he married in 1966 two years later they had a son named alfred122 on 19 november 1970 fliegerbauer was appointed to the rank of polizeiobermeister police sergeant in the munich municipal police stationed in the implerstrae police district42122 during the olympics fliegerbauer was temporarily assigned to a bavarian readiness riot police unit bayerische bereitschaftspolizei122 on 5 september he was recalled to his police district and proceeded with a 30officer support team in the direction of munichriem airport42 midway they were informed that their destination was frstenfeldbruck air base where the munich police had planned to rescue the nine israeli hostages held by eight black september terrorists2642 their initial task was to set up barriers at the airbase no one was allowed in no one was allowed out42 as the situation evolved fliegerbauer and two other colleagues were instructed to take up positions at the foot of the airbase control tower crouched behind a wall directly across from where the two bell uh1 helicopters transporting the hostages and terrorists would land2942 armed with their standard policeissue 6shot walther pp sidearms a spare magazine each and one radio between them they were to provide fire support for the snipers on the airfield2942 amid the gunfire that ensued fliegerbauers team leader zugfhrer arved semerak recalled standing 20 m 66 ft away when fliegerbauer was fatally hit by a stray bullet from the hostagetakers42 in the chaos semerak did not notice what had happened until paramedics began attending to fliegerbauer42 according to simon reeve author of one day in september fliegerbauer had fired less than half the rounds in his magazine when a stray bullet from the hostagetakers struck him in the side of the head killing him2642 fliegerbauer was buried on 8 september after a civic funeral the ceremony was attended by the mayor of munich georg kronawitter and prime minister of bavaria alfons goppel with wreaths laid on behalf of brandt and president
