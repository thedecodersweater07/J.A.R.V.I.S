as the emperor gaozu of southern han was the first emperor of the chinese southern han dynasty one of the ten kingdoms during the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period liu yan was born in 889 during the reign of emperor zhaozong of tang3 his father liu zhiqian also known as liu qian was then the prefect of feng prefecture in modern fengkai guangdong and was married to a lady wei the niece of wei zhou a prior military governor jiedushi of lingnan east circuit headquartered in modern guangzhou guangdong which feng prefecture belonged to however he also secretly had a concubine outside the home a lady duan and it was to lady duan that liu yan was born when lady wei found out she killed lady duan but could not bear to kill the infant liu yan and she took him back home to be raised as her own as a younger brother to her own sons liu yin and liu tai 56 as liu yan grew up it was said that he was tall and capable in both horsemanship and archery5 after liu yan became the commander of the army of the circuit which had been renamed qinghai by that point under the military governor li zhirou the prince of xue in 8967 liu yan was also given the title of military advisor to li zhirou as the prince of xue and his name was changed from liu yan to liu zhi5 in 901 li zhirous successor xu yanruo died leaving a recommendation to emperor zhaozong that liu yin be made acting military governor and liu yin subsequently took that title8 liu zhi continued serving under his brother and was first recorded to have participated in a campaign in 902 when lu guangchou who controlled the qian prefecture in modern ganzhou jiangxi region as qians prefect attacked qinghai capturing shao prefecture in modern shaoguan guangdong and giving it to his son lu yanchang and then putting chao prefecture in modern chaozhou guangdong under siege liu yin personally led an army and repelled lu guangchou from chao and then prepared to attack shao under liu zhis advice as liu zhi believed that a direct attack would not be successful due to the strength of lu yanchangs army he put shao under siege to try to wear out lu yanchangs defense but the strategy backfired when due to high water levels on the river the qinghai armys food supplies were disrupted lu guangchou then launched a relief army from qian repelling liu yin from shao9 meanwhile emperor zhaozong commissioned the chancellor cui yuan as the new military governor of qinghai but cui while on the way to qinghai heard about popular uprisings in the region and also was worried that liu yin would not yield the position to him and therefore returned to thencapital luoyang subsequently after liu yin bribed the powerful warlord zhu quanzhong the military governor of xuanwu circuit headquartered in modern kaifeng henan who had the tang imperial court under his physical control by that point emperor zhaozongs son and successor emperor ai of tang commissioned liu yin as full military governor in 90410 liu zhi served as liu yins deputy military governor it was said that at that time in addition to the continued conflict with lu guangchou substantial portions of the region were controlled by other warlordskhc ho at jiao prefecture in modern hanoi vietnam liu shizheng at gui prefecture in modern guilin guangxi ye guangle at yong prefecture in modern nanning guangxi pang juzhao at rong prefecture in modern rong county guangxi liu changlu at gao prefecture in modern gaozhou guangdong and liu qian different person than liu zhis father at xin prefecture in modern yunfu guangdong in addition east of the pearl river there were some 70 camps of people who did not recognize liu yins authorities it was said that after liu yin entrusted the military matters to liu zhi liu zhi gradually had these warlords expelled or forced into submission such that he became known as the preeminent general in the lingnan region5 one of these campaigns was described as in or around 910 by which time liu yin was a vassal of the new later liang which zhu had established as its emperor taizu and carried the title of prince of nanping or nanhai when liu zhi attacked liu changlu at gao prefecture liu changlu repelled his attack but figured that he would not be able to indefinitely hold out against the liu brothers and therefore along with pang offered to submit to ma yin the prince of chu ma sent troops to safely escort liu changlu and pang back to his territory and had his general yao yanzhang take up garrison at rong prefecture11 in 911 liu yin grew deathly ill he submitted a petition recommending liu zhi as acting military governor and died shortly after liu zhi took over the circuit shortly after later liangs emperor taizu made liu zhi full military governor12 his name was changed back to liu yan5 it was said that liu yan while serving as military governor frequently invited members of the intelligentsia who had fled from the central plain to serve on his staff and often made them prefects of the circuits prefectures so among the prefects there were no military officers12 meanwhile also in 911 lu guangchous son and successor lu yanchang was assassinated by his officer li qiu who subsequently died and was succeeded by another officer li yantu as li qiu had considered killing lu guangchous chief strategist tan quanbo tan claimed to be ill and retired from the qian prefecture army hearing of this liu yan dispatched an army to attack shao prefecture and captured it its prefect liao shuang fled to chu allowing liu yan to take shao under his control meanwhile he also again attacked rong prefecture yao yanzhang was unable to stand up against his attacks despite being aided by a chu relief force commanded by xu dexun so yao took the people and left rong prefecture allowing liu to take control of the rong prefecture region as well as gao prefecture hearing of the war between two of his vassals later liangs emperor taizu sent a delegation led by the official wei jian to try to mediate a peace between ma and liu12 liu responded by sending a large tribute of gold silver rhinoceros horns ivory and other assorted jewels and spices to emperor taizu5 in late 912 emperor taizu was assassinated and succeeded by his son zhu yougui the prince of ying12 in early 913 zhu yougui bestowed the honorary title of acting taifu emperors professor on liu5 he was subsequently defeated in a countercoup led by his brother zhu youzhen the prince of jun and committed suicide zhu youzhen who took the throne and changed his name to zhu zhen12 then gave liu the title of not only military governor of qinghai but also of jianwu circuit headquartered at yong prefecture and also created him the prince of nanping a title previously held by liu yin5 also in 913 liu yan sought a marital alliance with ma yin and ma agreed12 in 915 liu sent a delegation to chus capital changsha to welcome mas daughter empress ma as his bride and ma sent his brother ma cun to escort her to qinghai meanwhile liu was dissatisfied that he was only given the title of prince of nanping while another later liang vassal qian liu carried the greater title of prince of wuyue he made a request to zhu zhen that he be created the similarly honored title of prince of nanyue and be given a further title as commander of the circuits when zhu zhen refused liu commented13 now the central plain is in confusion no one knows who is the true son of heaven with the mandate of heaven how can i send emissaries over the mountains and the seas to serve a false dynasty thereafter liu stopped sending tributes and emissaries to the later liang court13 in fall 917 liu went further and declared himself emperor of a new state of yue at his capital of panyu which he renamed xingwang he posthumously honored his grandfather liu anren father liu qian and brother liu yin as emperors2 he commissioned the later liang emissaries zhao guangyi and li yinheng who were previously detained by liu yin11 as well as his deputy military governor yang dongqian chancellors2 also in 917 liu yan gave his niece liu hua the daughter of his brother liu yin whom he had created the princess qingyuan in marriage to wang yanjun a son of his northeastern neighbor wang shenzhi the prince of min who remained a later liang vassal to cement a relationship between the two states2514 in 918 after liu yan offered sacrifices to heaven and earth and issued a general pardon he changed the name of his state from yue to han and thus his state became known as southern han2 in 919 liu yan pronounced his wife lady ma empress2 in 920 at yang dongqians request liu yan established schools and imperial examinations apparently following the tang model he also sent emissaries to former shu seeking friendly relations15 in 922 there was an incident where liu yan believing in the words of a sorcerer that he needed to leave the capital to avoid a disaster left xingwang to visit meikou in modern meizhou guangdong near the min border the min general wang yanmei wang shenzhis son or nephew decided to launch a surprise attack on liu yans train but before wang yanmeis forces arrived liu yan received the news and fled meikou before min forces could attack15 in 924 liu yan launched an attack on min advancing on the borders of mins ting in modern longyan fujian and zhang in modern zhangzhou fujian prefectures a min counterattack defeated him and he fled16 meanwhile in 923 later liang had been conquered by its northern rival jin whose prince li cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new later tang as emperor zhuangzong17 when the news reached liu yan liu yan became fearful of this powerful new state in the north and in 925 sent his official he ci to later tang to try to seek friendly relations in humble terms16 referring to himself as the king of the great han rather than emperor while addressing emperor zhuangzong as the emperor of the great tang5 and to find out more about the strength of this new dynasty after he ci returned he ci reported that emperor zhuangzong had become arrogant and excessive and that there was no need to be fearful of him liu yan was pleased and from this point on no longer sought communications with later tang16 later in the year it was said that a white dragon was discovered in the han palace in response liu yan changed his era name to bailong white dragon and changed his own name to gong 18 however later in the year when foreign monks informed him that the character gong was not favorable to southern hans fortune he further changed his name to a newly created character yn showing the character of a dragon over that of heaven the pronunciation was similar to his birth name but distinct in tone1920 the zizhi tongjian placed this second name change in 94121 also in 925 when zheng min the emperor of changhe sent his brother zheng zhaochun to southern han to seek a marriage alliance liu yan gave another niece the princess zengcheng to zheng min in marriage61819 in 928 a chu fleet attacked southern han and put feng prefecture under siege in response liu yan believing that dayou was a phrase from the i ching that would portend good fortune in battle changed the era name to dayou and also sent the general su zhang to take a fleet manned with welltrained archers to try to lift the siege on feng su engaged the chu fleet and pretended to withdraw after a skirmish inducing the chu fleet to chase he then caught the chu fleet in an ambush and defeated it forcing the chu forces to withdraw22 in 930 liu yan sent his generals liang kezhen and li shoufu to attack jiao prefecture they captured it and took khc tha m son and successor of khc ho captive taking for the time being jinghai circuit vietnamese tnh hi headquartered at jiao prefecture under southern han control and ending the control of the circuit by the khc family liang further advanced to champa and pillaged it of its treasure liu stationed his general li jin at jiao prefecture to defend it23 the southern han hold on jinghai would not last long however after the fall of the khcs dng nh ngh the prefect of ai prefecture vietnamese i chu in modern thanh ha province vietnam built up a personal army of 3000 adoptive sons wanting to take control of jinghai although li knew about this he did nothing as he was receiving regular bribes from dng in 931 dng nh ngh put jiao prefecture under siege liu yan sent the general cheng bao to try to lift the siege but before cheng could get there the city fell li fled back to xingwang where liu put him to death cheng tried to recapture jiao prefecture but dng nh ngh defeated and killed him in battle23 in 932 liu yan created his 19 sons as imperial princes24 in 934 empress ma died25 also in 934 liu yan allowed his thensurviving oldest son liu hongdu the prince of qin liu hongdus older brothers liu yaoshu and liu guitu having died earlier6 to form a guard force of his own but these guard ranks were filled with hoodlums that liu hongdu was close to when yang dongqian tried to speak on this matter to advise liu yan to curb liu hongdus activities as liu hongdu was commonly regarded as the heir liu yan refused to listen when yang subsequently observed the guards pillage gold and silk from merchants and the merchants fear causing them not to report the matter yang lamented if the rule is as troubled as this what is a chancellor for he thus claimed an illness and retired to his mansion liu yan subsequently never again summoned yang for any audiences and yang eventually died at his home without returning to chancellorship25 in 936 liu yan sent his general sun dewei to attack chus meng in modern wuzhou guangxi and gui in modern guilin guangxi when chus prince ma xifan ma yins son personally went to gui prefecture to defend against the attack sun withdrew26 in 937 dng nh ngh was killed by his general kiu cng tin who took over jinghai in 938 when another former general of dngs ng quyn rose at ai prefecture and subsequently attacked jiao prefecture kiu cng tin sought aid from southern han liu yan wanted to use this opportunity to take over jinghai again so he commissioned his son liu hongcao as the military governor of jinghai and changed his title to prince of jiao having him command an army to head to jiao prefecture while liu yan himself commanded a followup army by the time that liu hongcao was approaching jiao prefecture however ng quyn had already defeated and killed kiu cng tin and occupied jiao prefecture when liu hongcao prepared to attack ng quyn set a trap for himsetting large wooden planks covered with iron into the tidal zone such that when liu hongcao attacked at high tide the planks were invisible but when the tide fell the southern han ships became stuck on the planks and unable to move ng quyn then counterattacked killing more than half of the southern han soldiers including liu hongcao liu yan hearing the news cried bitterly and withdrew his own fleet27 this became known as the battle of bch ng river in 939 zhao guangyi pointing out that there had not been any emissaries sent between southern han and chu after empress mas death and that the two states related by marriage should be friendly to each other recommended the official li shu as an appropriate emissary liu yan agreed and after li visited chu chu also sent emissaries to southern han reestablishing relations between the two states despite this in 941 liu yan sent an emissary to later jins emperor gaozu whose later jin state had earlier taken over later tangs territory seeking a military alliance where they would attack chu and divide its territory the later jin emperor declined21 in 942 liu yan grew seriously ill he considered both of his oldest surviving sons liu hongdu and liu hongxi the prince of jin to be arrogant and unrestrained and considered a younger son liu hongchang the prince of yue to be an appropriate successor he thus considered sending liu hongdu and liu hongxi out of the capital and making liu hongchang his heir however the official xiao yi persuaded him that bypassing older sons would cause disturbances and so liu yan did not carry out this plan he soon died and liu hongdu became emperor as emperor shang4 the zizhi tongjian summarizing the opinions from other sources commented about liu yans reign4 gaozu ie liu yan was observant and capable of political tactics but was selfimportant often referring to the emperors of the central plain as prefect of luo prefecture ie luoyang which often served as the capital of five dynasties states the lingnan region was where rare jewels could be gathered so he was luxurious in his living and favored beautiful things adorning his palaces with gold jades and pearls he was cruel in his punishments using methods including cutting off noses cutting off tongues dismemberment cutting pregnant women open tying people to heated iron poles and boiling people he also sometimes put poisonous snakes in the water and threw criminals into the water referring to this as water prison when the chancellor yang dongqian tried to correct his ways he would not listen to yang in his late years he was particularly suspicious of the intelligentsia believing that the officials would be more concerned about the welfare of their descendants rather than of the state and therefore became trusting of eunuchs therefore from this point on southern han had many eunuchs
