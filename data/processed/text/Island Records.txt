until 2014 current key people include imran majid and justin eshak who were named coceos of island records in 2021 partially due to its significant legacy island remains one of umgs preeminent record labels island records was founded in jamaica on 4 july 1959 by chris blackwell graeme goodall and leslie kong and financed by stanley borden from rko its name was inspired by the harry belafonte song island in the sun23 blackwell stated in 2009 i loved music so much i just wanted to get into it or be as close to it as i could2 blackwells first album was lance hayward at the half moon hotel which was recorded in late 19594 tom hayes the labels sales manager between 1965 and 1967 referred to the early period of the label in the uk as organized chaos the 1964 hit my boy lollipop sung by jamaican singer millie small 19472020 was the labels first success in the uk and led to a world tour that also involved blackwell in a 50th anniversary documentary blackwell stated that he was only interested in building longterm careers at that stage in time rather than shortterm projects2 suzette newman has been a close colleague of chris blackwells since working together in the early days of island records and while there she ran the mango world music label5 suzette newman and chris salewicz were the editors for the book the story of island records keep on running6 blackwell relocated to england in may 1962 to garner greater levels of attention after the local jamaican sound systems proved to be overwhelmingly successful the label was based at a now demolished basement in kilburn london borough of brent in a property that was used by sonny robertss planetone label and whose landlord was lee gopthal who would later create trojan records78 the vast majority of the artists who had signed to blackwells fledgling label while he was in jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the uk while in england blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city he did not provide any copies to radio stations as they would not play any of the island music the music was also not reviewed by the press2 meanwhile goodall left to start the doctor bird record label in 19659 blackwell signed the spencer davis group to the label at that time many island releases were being distributed by philipsfontana the group became very popular and island started their own independent series to spotlight uk rock talent they signed artists such as john martyn fairport convention free and greatly influenced the growing fm radio market by the late 1960s and early 1970s they were a major label in england with artists including roxy music king crimson sparks traffic the wailers cat stevens steve winwood and many others in the us many of their releases were licensed to am prior to signing up distribution deals with capitol and later atlantic and also independent distribution for toots and the maytals the group that introduced the term reggae in song with their 1968 single do the reggay10 chris blackwell was the one who decided on the lineup of the group before introducing them to an international audience blackwell had signed bob marley and now toots and the maytals in november 2016 jackie jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for kool 97 fm jamaica11 accompanied by paul douglas and radcliffe dougie bryan in studio jackson explained were all original members of toots and the maytals band first it was toots and the maytals three guys toots raleigh and jerry and then they were signed to island records chris blackwell and we were their recording band one day we were summoned to chris house and he says alright gentleman i think its time this toots and the maytals looks like its going to be a big thing by this time he had already signed bob marley so in his camp island records there was toots and the maytals the late bob marley we were talking about reggae is going international now we kept on meeting and he blackwell decided that the backing band that back all of the songs the recording band should be the maytals band so everything came under toots and the maytals so we became maytals also and then we hit the road in 1975 we were the opening act for the eagles linda ronstadt and jackson browne we were the opening act for the who for about two weeks11 in 1969 island records acquired a deconsecrated 17th century church building at 810 basing street in the ladbroke grove area of notting hill in west london the building was refurbished to create the island studios recording studio while also serving as the new location for island records offices12 the first toots and the maytals album released and distributed by chris blackwells island records was funky kingston the maytals had recently added a fulltime backing band that included drummer paul douglas and bassist jackie jackson and chris blackwell joined the group in the studio as a coproducer for the album13 music critic lester bangs described the album in stereo review as perfection the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released14 as blackwell says the maytals were unlike anything else sensational raw and dynamic15 blackwell had a strong commitment to toots and the maytals saying ive known toots longer than anybody much longer than bob bob marley toots is one of the purest human beings ive met in my life pure almost to a fault16 despite the initial establishment work that blackwell completed almost singlehandedly island struggled as a business in the late 1970s and early 1980s bob marleys 1981 death was detrimental to the label especially after its having engineered marleys international breakthrough only a few years earlier while irish rock band u2 which had signed to island in march 1980 was growing in popularity but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come in 1981 blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company producing the film countryman17 in 1982 paul morley and producer trevor horn started the ztt label under the island banner and blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label1 morley recalls in a 2009 book about island records i eventually grew to appreciate how chris blackwell and therefore island records was not about one thing or one style or one system or one way of doing things i began reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid sometimes dangerous always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs18 in 1983 the film production company formed a partnership with shep gordons alive enterprises to form island alive and had success with kiss of the spider woman koyaanisqatsi and stop making sense17 the partnership was dissolved in 198517 in august 1987 the company was not able to pay us5 million that it owed to u2 in royalties for the joshua tree album as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films u2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they received a stake in the label that was estimated to be around 10 per cent19 the labels 4th broadway division operating since the mid1980s achieved some success marketing alternative hip hop and dancepop music with artists such as eric b and rakim and the stereo mcs mango chaka demus and pliers was another island danceoriented subsidiary while it was singer robert palmer who achieved worldwide success with the rock song addicted to love in 1986 african musicians such as king sunny ad and anglique kidjo were also championed by blackwell1 in july 1989 blackwell sold island records and island music to the polygram uk group for 180 million18 he explained in 2009 it became too big and too corporate for me and i couldnt really handle itcitation needed following the sale island was no longer an independent company but blackwell was given a position on polygrams board and stayed on as ceo of polygrams new island entertainment division for ten years20 polygram immediately began reissuing much of the island back catalogue on compact disc and expanded islands reach through its global manufacturing and distribution network but the label was relatively unfocused in the 1990scitation needed between 1993 and 1995 island had a sublabel called the island red label which focused on independent artists21 blackwell eventually ended his association with the company in 1997 as the corporate life hindered the independent ethos of his personal life i never really had a job until i sold island to polygram in 1989 it had gotten too corporate he commented afterwards after blackwell left polygram closed islands film business22 blackwell left to found the palm pictures company and run a chain of boutique hotels in miami us and the caribbean including the very exclusive goldeneye once the jamaican home of james bond creator ian fleming2 then in may 1998 all of polygram and its associated labels were purchased by seagram which announced its plan to integrate polygram with umg to produce an estimated cost savings within a couple of years of between us275 million and 300 million annually seagram further explained that the acquisition would unite a significant international presence with a thriving domestic business as more than threequarters of polygrams sales were outside the us23 in december 1998 and the first three months of 1999 umg placed three divisions under the management of the island brand one in the uk one in the us and one in germanycitation needed in each territory these companies were merged under umbrella groups however in 2001 umg was merged with french company vivendi sa to create vivendi universal sa but the music company remains under the name universal music group umg25 in the us island became a predominantly poprock label as their urban artists were assigned to either def jam or def soul a new islanddef jam rb imprintcitation needed following the takeover of island by umg flagship band u2 were dissatisfied after chief jason iley moved to the mercury label in the mid2000s and signed with mercury for the uk and interscope records for the us26 however successful artists such as tricky and pj harvey were impressed by the label and signed on as artists tricky explained i knew i could get freedom i knew i could do what i wanted to do2 while harvey later stated i came to work with them sort of fully formedthe way that i looked the way that i sounded that was already there and i felt like that they just supported where that was going to go2 the label celebrated its 50th
