in september 2014 and february 2015 aimed to resolve the conflict but ceasefires and further negotiations failed70 the wests weak response to russias attack led russia to believe the west would not react strongly to the 2022 invasion717273 several political scientists said this encouraged further russian aggression747576 economic interests were also a motive for russias attack on ukraine and its annexation of the southeast control of lithium deposits in the donbas and ukraines grain wealth would give russia a monopoly on the world market77 in 2022 russian general vladimir ovchinsky confirmed

ukraine issuing denials up until the day before the invasion818283 while russian troops massed on ukraines borders russias proxy forces launched thousands of attacks on ukrainian troops in the donbas84 observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce which includes ukraine and russia reported more than 90000 ceasefire violations throughout 2021 most in russiancontrolled territory85 in july 2021 putin published an essay on the historical unity of russians and ukrainians in which he called ukraine historically russian lands and claimed there is no historical basis for the idea of ukrainian people as a nation separate from the russians8687 putin claimed ukraine never had real statehood and the creation of modern ukraine was a mistake88 putin was accused of promoting russian imperialism89 historical revisionism and disinformation9091 the december 2021 russian ultimatum to nato included demands that nato end activity in its eastern european member states and ban ukraine or any former soviet state from ever joining the alliance189293 russias government said nato was a threat and warned of a military response if it followed an aggressive line94 some demands had already been ruled out by nato a us official said the us was willing to discuss the proposals but there were some the russians know are unacceptable92 eastern european states willingly joined nato for security reasons and the last time a country bordering russia had joined was in 2004 ukraine had not yet applied and some members were wary of letting it join95 barring ukraine would go against natos open door policy and against treaties agreed to by russia96 nato secretary general jens stoltenberg replied that russia has no say on whether ukraine joins and no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours97 nato underlined that it is a defensive alliance and it had cooperated with russia until the latter annexed crimea96 it offered to improve communication with russia and negotiate limits on missile placements and military exercises as long as russia withdrew troops from ukraines borders98 but russia did not western leaders vowed heavy sanctions would be imposed should putin invade rather than negotiate99 french president emmanuel macron100 and german chancellor olaf scholz met putin in february 2022 to dissuade him from an invasion putin told him that ukraine should not be an independent state101 scholz told ukrainian president zelenskyy to declare ukraine a neutral country and renounce its aspirations to join nato zelenskyy replied that putin could not be trusted as he had broken agreements102 ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when russia occupied crimea and invaded the donbas65103 on 19 february zelenskyy made a speech at the munich security conference calling for western powers to end their appeasement towards putin and give a clear timeframe for when ukraine could join nato104 analysts taras kuzio and vladimir socor agree that when russia made its decision to invade ukraine that country was more remote than ever not only from nato membership but from any track that might lead to membership93 shortly before the invasion russias proxy forces stepped up attacks on ukrainian forces and civilians in the donbas105106 separatist leaders warned that ukraine was about to launch an offensive but they gave no evidence and the guardian noted it would be exceedingly risky for ukraine to assault the donbas while russian troops were massed on its borders106 ukraine and western leaders accused russia of staging false flag attacks and trying to provoke retaliation to give russia a pretext for invading105106 on 17 february russian proxy forces shelled a kindergarten in ukrainianheld territory then blamed it on ukraine106 zelenskyy said his military would not respond to the provocations105 the royal united services institute reported that russias plan involved defeating ukraine within ten days and capturing or killing its government followed by mopping up operations establishing filtration camps for ukrainians setting up occupation regimes executing people involved in the revolution of dignity and lastly annexation107108109 the decision to invade was reportedly made by putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in putins inner circle including national security adviser nikolai patrushev and defence minister sergei shoigu110 after the start of the invasion ukrainian and western analysts tentatively assessed that putin seemed to have assumed that the russian armed forces would be capable of capturing the ukrainian capital city of kyiv within days this assessment eventually led to the commonly reached conclusion that taking kyiv in three days had been the original objective or expectation of the invasion111112113 aleksandr lukashenko had already stated that in case of war kyiv would be taken in 3 4 days114115 margarita simonyan editorinchief of the russian statecontrolled broadcaster rt had made similar remarks about russia being able to defeat ukraine in 2 days116 the narrative of the planned three day capture of kyiv was further reinforced on 2 march when the security service of ukraine sbu repeated the claim following its release of a video showing a captured russian soldier claiming that his unit was sent into ukraine with food supplies for only three days117118 documents found inside russian tanks mention how the special military operation would conclude in ten days119 ukraine also captured flagship tanks as used in parades along with military parade uniforms suggesting that russia expected to stage a victory parade in kyiv after a quick conquest120121 three days after the invasion began ria novosti a russian state news agency mistakenly published an article entitled russias coming and the new world which was prepared in advance in anticipation of a russian victory it announced that russia had won the russoukrainian war and that ukraine had returned to russia122123 zelenskyy also admitted that he had received an ultimatum to be replaced with viktor medvedchuk124125 on 21 february putin announced that russia recognised the donetsk peoples republic and luhansk peoples republic as independent states the following day russia announced that it was sending troops into the territories as peacekeepers126 and the federation council of russia authorised the use of military force abroad127 before 5 am kyiv time on 24 february putin in another speech announced a special military operation which effectively declared war on ukraine128129 putin said the operation was to protect the people of the russiancontrolled breakaway republics he baselessly claimed that russians in the donbas had been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the kyiv regime for 8 years20 putin said russia was being threatened he baselessly claimed that ukrainian officials were neonazis under western control that ukraine was developing nuclear weapons and a hostile nato was building up its forces and infrastructure in ukraine130131 he said russia sought the demilitarisation and denazification of ukraine and denied the legitimacy of the ukrainian state13188 putin said he had no plans to occupy ukraine130 the invasion began within minutes of putins speech128 the invasion began at dawn on 24 february128132 it was the biggest attack on a european country and first fullscale war in europe since world war ii133 russia launched a simultaneous ground and air attack134135 missiles struck targets throughout ukraine136 and russian troops invaded from the north east and south137 russia did not officially declare war138 immediately after the invasion began zelenskyy declared martial law in ukraine in a video speech139 the same evening he ordered a general mobilisation of all ukrainian males aged 1860140 prohibiting them from leaving the country141 the first stage of the invasion was conducted on four fronts one towards western kyiv from belarus by the russian eastern military district one deployed towards eastern kyiv by the central military district northeastern front comprised the 41st combined arms army and the 2nd guards combined arms army142 one deployed towards kharkiv and a fourth southern front originating in crimea and russias rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards odesa and a western area of operations toward mariupol142 the invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce resistance143 in kyiv russia failed to take it and was repulsed in the battles of irpin hostomel and bucha the russians tried to encircle the capital but defenders under oleksandr syrskyi held their ground effectively using western javelin antitank missiles and stinger antiaircraft missiles to thin russian supply lines and stall the offensive144 by 7 april russian troops deployed to the northern front pulled back from kyiv to resupply and redeploy to the donbas to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern ukraine the northeastern front including the central military district was similarly withdrawn for redeployment to southeastern ukraine142145 on 26 april delegates from the us and 40 allied nations met at ramstein air base in germany to discuss a coalition to provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to ukraine146 following putins victory day speech on 9 may us director of national intelligence avril haines said no short term resolution should be expected147 ukraines reliance on westernsupplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness as supplying countries feared ukraine would use westernmade matriel to strike targets in russia148 experts disagreed on the future of the conflict some suggested ukraine should trade territory for peace149 others believed ukraine could maintain its resistance due to russian losses150 the invasion began on 24 february launched out of belarus to target kyiv and from the northeast against the city of kharkiv the southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads from crimea and the southeast against luhansk and donetsk russian tried to seize kyiv quickly with a probative spearhead on 24 february from belarus south along the west bank of the dnipro river with spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north but failed151152 the apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west supported by two separate axes of attack along the east bank of the dnipro the western at chernihiv and from the east at sumy134135 russian forces advanced into chernihiv oblast on 24 february besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting153154 travelling along highways russian forces reached brovary an eastern suburb of kyiv on 4 march135134 the us contacted zelenskyy and offered to help him flee lest the russian army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing kyiv zelenskyy responded that the fight is here i need ammunition not a ride155 by early march russian advances along the west side of the dnipro were limited by ukrainian defences135134 as of 5 march a russian convoy reportedly 64 kilometres 40 mi long had made little progress toward kyiv156 advances from chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there russian forces advanced on kyiv from the northwest capturing bucha hostomel and vorzel by 5 march157158159 by 11 march the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover160 on 16 march ukrainian forces began a counteroffensive161 unable to achieve a quick victory in kyiv russian forces switched to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare162163 on 25 march a ukrainian counteroffensive retook towns to the east and west of kyiv164165 russian troops in the bucha area retreated north ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 april and recaptured the region around kyiv and uncovered evidence of war crimes in bucha166167 the pentagon confirmed on 6 april that the russian army had left chernihiv oblast168 local authorities said russian troops had left sumy oblast169 nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said the russian retraction resupply and redeployment of troops from the kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of putins plans for concentrating his forces on eastern ukraine145 on 24 february russian attack groups moved northwest from crimea capturing bridges over the dnieper170 and the north crimean canal171 on 1 march kherson was the first major city to fall to russia172 russian troops moved on mykolaiv and

captured on 15 august329 ukraine taking advantage of the lack of experienced units and defences along the border with kursk oblast was able to quickly seize territory in the opening days of the incursion330 the incursion caused russia to divert thousands of troops from occupied ukrainian territory to counter the threat331332 though not from donetsk oblast332 despite repeated deadlines set by

has been significantly lower629 para 105 630631632 in june 2024 an investigation by the financial times identified four ukrainian children on a russian governmentlinked adoption website who had been abducted from state care homes the childrens ukrainian background was not mentioned one child was shown with a new russian name and an age that differed from their ukrainian documents while another

times investigation ukrainian authorities estimate that nearly 20000 ukrainian children have been forcibly taken from occupied territories to russia since the fullscale invasion began wayne jordash president of humanitarian law firm global rights compliance described forcibly transferring or deporting children as war crimes adding that when done as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population russia is also committing crimes against humanity633634 in march 2025 the isw said that by the time the invasion started russia had already laid the groundwork for massive deportation of ukrainian children with putin recognizing depriving ukraine of its multigenerational potential as a way to dominate the ukrainian people isw cited kremlin documents uncovered by ukrainian human rights activists dated 18 february 2022 describing plans to move ukrainian children from orphanages in occupied donetsk and luhansk oblasts to russia under humanitarian evacuations particularly planning to target vulnerable children without parental care in the years following the invasion russia has embarked on a deeply institutionalised project to abduct and forcibly give ukrainian children a russian identity international law explicitly forbids this kind of forcible transfer of children and holds moving children for the purpose of damaging a national or ethnic group to be an act of genocide635 in august 2025 mykola kuleba the head of a ukrainian ngo said that russian occupation authorities in ukraine had created an online catalog where users are able to browse ukrainian children offered up for adoption while sorted by physical traits such as hair and eye color denouncing the practice as child trafficking636637638639 the international criminal court icc opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity genocide and war crimes committed in ukraine640 on 17 march 2023 the icc issued a warrant for putins arrest charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to russia641 it was the first time that the icc had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the united nations security council641 the worlds five principal nuclear powers642 moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes a response vittorio bufacchi of university college cork says has bordered on the farcical643 and its contention that the images coming out of bucha were fabricated a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris posttruth on overdrive that does not merit to be taken seriously even the usually fractured united states senate came together to call putin a war criminal644 one of several efforts to document russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys in a country where deliberate starvation of ukrainians by soviets the holodomor still looms large in public memory645 forcible deportation of populations such as took place in mariupol is another area of focus since646 forced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the fourth geneva convention and protocol ii and article 8 of the rome statuteand as crimes against humanityunder article 7 of the rome statute as both war crimes and crimes against humanity they have several mechanisms for individual accountability the international criminal court and also at the individual state level universal jurisdiction and magnitsky sanctions legislation the icc also issued arrest warrants for military officials sergey kobylash viktor sokolov sergei shoigu and valery gerasimov647648 the invasion contributed to the 2022 food crises649 as of february 2025 37 million ukrainians were internally displaced and 69 million were refugees650 russian attacks on civilians causing mass civilian casualties and displacement have been characterised as genocide and democide27282930 in september 2023 a unmandated investigative body reported that russian occupiers had tortured ukrainians to death and forced families to listen as they raped women next door651 the commission previously found that violations committed by russian forces in ukraine may constitute crimes against humanity652 by august 2024 the who had recorded 1940 attacks against ukrainian health care and reported widespread doubletap attacks653 in 2023 physicians for human rights described russian attacks on ukraines health care system as having a reasonable basis to be considered war crimes and could potentially constitute crimes against humanity654 deliberate destruction and looting of cultural heritage sites is a war crime during armed conflict it is an act of aggression655 as of august 2025 unesco has verified damage to 508 ukrainian cultural sites including 151 religious sites 34 museums 33 monuments and 18 libraries656 in 2022 the european parliament labelled russias destruction of ukrainian cultural property a war crime657 ukraines minister of culture oleksandr tkachenko called it cultural genocide658 the war has caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in europe since world war ii659 in the first week of the invasion the un reported over a million refugees had fled ukraine this reached over eight million by february 2023660661 in may 2022 following an influx of military equipment into ukraine a significant number of refugees sought to return to regions relatively isolated from the invasion front in southeastern ukraine662 by 3 may another 8 million people were displaced inside ukraine663 most refugees were women children elderly or disabled664 most male ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from ukraine as part of mandatory conscription665 unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children single fathers or were the parentguardian of children with disabilities666 many ukrainian men including teenagers opted to remain in ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance667 according to the un high commission for refugees as of may 2022 there were 3315711 refugees in poland 901696 in romania 594664 in hungary 461742 in moldova 415402 in slovakia and 27308 in belarus while russia reported it had received over 800104 refugees660 by july 2022 over 390000 ukrainian refugees had arrived in the czech republic where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by a child these refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the czech population as a whole668 turkey registered more than 58000 ukrainian refugees as of march 2022669 the eu invoked the temporary protection directive for the first time granting ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the eu for up to three years670 britain has accepted 146379 refugees as well as extending the ability to remain in the uk for three years with broadly similar entitlements as the eu three years residency and access to state welfare and services671 according to the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce russia has engaged in massive deportation of over 13 million ukrainian civilians potentially constituting crimes against humanity672 the osce and ukraine have accused russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in russianheld territory and then into russia ukrainian sources have compared this policy to sovietera population transfers and russian actions in the chechen war of independence673 for instance as of april 2022 russia claimed to have evacuated about 121000 mariupol residents to russia673674 ria novosti and ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to centres in cities in russia and russianoccupied ukraine675 from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of russia676677j both russia and ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration it is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other679 russia had a fightingage 18to40yearold male population more than four times higher than ukraines and slightly higher birth rates while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in ukraine680 several sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening ukraines demographic crisis making significant shrinking very likely681 a july 2023 study by the vienna institute for international economic studies stated that682 regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants around 20 fewer than before the war 2021 428 million and the decline in the workingage population is likely to be the most severe and farreaching the study took different scenarios from a best case end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation to a worst case end of the war in 2025 with further escalation into account flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of childbearing age and their children with an estimate of more than 20 of refugees not returning study author maryna tverdostup concluded that longterm shrinking will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction682 the war in ukraine and the associated emigration lower birth rates and warrelated casualties further deepened the demographic crisis of russia683 many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the 1990s684 the un is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue and if current demographic conditions persist russias population would be 120 million in fifty years a decline of about 17685686 since february 2022 hundreds of thousands of russians have emigrated estimates range from 370000 to over 820000 combined with mobilisation this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million workingage males from russias population687 studies report that this will have a demographic effect especially in russia that lasts much longer than the conflict and putins time in office688 according to bbc689 they come from different walks of life some are journalists like us but there are also it experts designers artists academics lawyers doctors pr specialists and linguists most are under 50 many share western liberal values and hope russia will be a democratic country one day some are lgbtq sociologists studying the current russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger better educated and wealthier than those staying more often they are from bigger cities according to johannes wachs the exodus of skilled human capital sometimes called brain drain out of russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the russian economy in the long run690 according to a survey around 15 percent of those who left returned to russia either permanently or to settle their affairs691 in november 2023 at the world russian peoples council putin urged russian women to have eight or more children amid increasing russian casualties in the invasion692 in july 2024 chief of the general staff of the british army roland walker said that with the current way of fighting it would take russia five years to control the four oblasts of donetsk luhansk kherson and zaporizhzhia that russia claims as its own and it would cost russia from 15 to 18 million casualties693 he said there are no winners in russias invasion adding it is an utter devastation for both sides and lost generations694 based on a preliminary assessment the war has inflicted 51 billion in environmental damage in ukraine according to a report by the yale school of the environment some 623000 tonnes 14 billion pounds of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling while nearly 1500 tonnes 32 million pounds of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 28 hectares 70 acres of soil and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible695 around 30 of ukraines land is now littered with explosives and more than 24 million hectares 59 million acres of forest have been damaged696 according to netherlandsbased peace organisation pax russias deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure has caused severe pollution and the use of explosive weapons has left millions of tonnes of contaminated debris in cities and towns697 in early june 2023 the kakhovka dam under russian occupation was damaged causing flooding and triggering warnings of an ecological disaster698 the ukrainian government international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide699 the ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide a crime in ukraine700 zelenskyy has met with prominent european figures heidi hautala margot wallstrom mary robinson and greta thunberg to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it701 according to an investigation by ngl media published in april 2024 russia has completely destroyed over 60000 hectares 150000 acres of ukrainian forests the investigation stated that longterm ecological consequences may include lowering of the groundwater level reduction of biodiversity worsening of air quality fire outbreaks and rivers and ponds drying up702 the war in ukraine has severely disrupted climate policy all over the world and increased co2 emissions703704 the effects have been strongly felt in asia705706707 europe708 and the us709 fatih birol the head of the international energy agency talking about the prospects of cop 28 noted710 the geopolitical situation with many nations at loggerheads over the war in ukraine and still frosty relations between the us and china would make for a difficult summit the most important challenge to limiting temperature rises to 15 c 27 f above preindustrial levels is the lack of international cooperation throughout the war putin implied that russia may use nuclear weapons if certain red lines were to be crossed by 2024 most of the russian governments red lines had been crossed without nuclear weapons being used in response711 four days into the invasion putin put russias nuclear forces on high alert raising fears that russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against ukraine712 in response to what he called completely irresponsible actions zelenskyy suggested that there should be global control of russias nuclear assets713 in march 2023 putin announced plans to install russian tactical nuclear weapons in belarus714 the invasion had an impact on ukraines nuclear power plants russian forces captured chernobyl on the first day leading to a huge spike in radiation levels715 russia also captured zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant the largest in europe and which has since been at risk and damaged by shelling in august 2022 zelenskyy described the situation as russian nuclear terror716 the international atomic energy agency said it was the first time a military conflict occurred amid nuclear plants and it called for a demilitarised zone around zaporizhzhia npp717 ukrainian minister of economic development and trade yulia svyrydenko announced that for 2022 ukraine had a 30 loss in their gross domestic product gdp718 the international monetary fund predicted that ukraines gdp would suffer a decrease from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 35719 the european bank for reconstruction and development also predicted that the invasion would cause a 20 decrease of ukraines gdp720 the ukrainian statistics service said that the gdp of ukraine in 2023 grew by 53721 ukraine began issuing war bonds on 1 march 2022 and the following day the ukrainian government announced that they had raised 614 billion hryvnias722 a ban was placed in may 2022 by the european commission on grain sales in the countries of bulgaria poland hungary romania and slovakia with the only exception being if they were transiting through those countries with the ban being lifted in september 2023723 the war has caused a major humanitarian crisis in ukraine the united nations development programme calculated in march 2022 that a prolonged conflict would cause 30 of the ukrainian population to fall below the poverty line while a further 62 would be at risk of also falling into poverty within a year724 the russian ministry of economic development said that for 2022 the gdp contracted by 21725 and for 2023 russias government said the gdp grew by 36726 on 27 april 2024 it was reported that russia was planning increases in personal income taxes and corporate taxes to help pay for the war727 in january 2025 it was reported that since early 2022 russia had used a twoprong strategy to finance the extremely large costs of the war in addition to the official russian government defence budgetdirect financial expenditure for waging the war in ukraine was estimated at us250 billion through june 2024 for military spending through normal channels24 with the military budget rising to over 20 of annual gdpan additional offbudget financing mechanism was employed to fund the war with over us200 billion of debt funding obtained from preferential bank loans made to defence contractors and warrelated businesses loans that had been compelled by the russian government2526 a report published in april 2025 by the stockholm institute of transition economics site part of the stockholm school of economics noted that official russian statistics are unreliable and opaque and serves to bolster the domestic narrative of economic resilience and questions the effectiveness of sanctions while masking underlying fragilities728 the report which was presented to the finance ministers of the eu at a meeting of the economic and financial affairs council on 13 may 2025 also argued that russian fiscal stimulus has kept the economy afloat so far but that it is on an unsustainable trajectory728729 even under optimistic growth scenarios russias economic scale remains insufficient to match its western adversaries capacity in a sustained geopolitical rivalry the report concluded728 in august 2025 veb one of the largest russian state banks assessed that the russian economy had started slipping into recession730 a price cap was placed on russian oil by the group of 7 g7 at 60 on 5 december 2022731 the united states banned all

march735 the talks ended without agreement in 2024 ukraines main peace terms were that russia withdraw its troops that ukrainian prisoners be released russian leaders be prosecuted for war crimes and ukraine be given security guarantees to prevent further aggression russias main terms were that russia must keep all the land it occupied that it be given all of the provinces that it claims but does not fully control that ukraine end plans to join nato and sanctions against russia be lifted737 according to western sources allowing russia to keep the land it seized would reward the aggressor while punishing the victim and set a dangerous precedent738 they predicted this would allow russia to rearm and encourage it to continue its imperialist campaign of expansionism against ukraine and other neighbors and embolden other expansionist regimes738739740741 after donald trump became us president in 2025 there was a major shift in us policy the trump administration began negotiations with russia and separately with ukraine in february 2025 the us under the trump administration twice sided with russia in un resolutions first opposing a europeandrafted resolution condemning russias actions and supporting the territorial integrity of ukraine and then drafting and voting for a un security council resolution calling for the end of the conflict but containing no criticism of russia742 the invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations743 on 2 march 2022 and on 23 february 2023 141 member states of the un

aid to ukraine and nearly 50 countries plus the eu provided military aid749 economic sanctions included a ban on russian aircraft using eu airspace750 a ban of certain russian banks from the swift international payments system and a ban on certain russian media outlets751 reactions to the invasion have included public response media responses peace efforts and the examination of the legal implications of the invasion some countries particularly in the global south saw public sympathy or outright support for russia due in part to distrust of us foreign policy752 protests and demonstrations were held worldwide including some in russia and parts of ukraine occupied by russia753 calls for a boycott of russian goods spread on social media platforms754 while hackers attacked russian websites particularly those operated by the russian government755 antirussian sentiment against russians living abroad surged after the invasion756 in march 2022 russian president putin
