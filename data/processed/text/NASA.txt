the national aeronautics and space administration nasa ns is an independent agency of the us federal government responsible for the united statess civil space program aeronautics research and space research established in 1958 it succeeded the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca to give the american space development effort a distinct civilian orientation emphasizing peaceful applications in space science it has since led most of americas space exploration programs including project mercury project gemini the 19681972 apollo program missions the skylab space station and the space shuttle currently nasa supports the international space station iss along with the commercial crew program and oversees the development of the orion spacecraft and the space launch system for the lunar artemis program nasas science division is focused on better understanding earth through the earth observing system advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the science mission directorates heliophysics research program exploring bodies throughout the solar system with advanced robotic spacecraft such as new horizons and planetary rovers such as perseverance and researching astrophysics topics such as the big bang through the james webb space telescope the four great observatories and associated programs the launch services program oversees launch operations for its uncrewed launches nasa traces its roots to the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca despite dayton ohio being the birth place of aviation by 1914 the united states recognized that it was far behind europe in aviation capability determined to regain american leadership in aviation the united states congress created the aviation section of the us army signal corps in 1914 and established naca in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development over the next forty years naca would conduct aeronautical research in support of the us air force us army us navy and the civil aviation sector after the end of world war ii naca became interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft developing and testing the bell x1 in a joint program with the us air force nacas interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the pilotless aircraft research division5 the soviet unions launch of sputnik 1 ushered in the space age and kicked off the space race despite nacas early rocketry program the responsibility for launching the first american satellite fell to the naval research laboratorys project vanguard whose operational issues ensured the army ballistic missile agency would launch explorer 1 americas first satellite on february 1 1958 the eisenhower administration decided to split the united statess military and civil spaceflight programs which were organized together under the department of defenses advanced research projects agency nasa was established on july 29 1958 with the signing of the national aeronautics and space act and it began operations on october 1 19585 as the americans premier aeronautics agency naca formed the core of nasas new structure by reassigning 8000 employees and three major research laboratories nasa also proceeded to absorb the naval research laboratorys project vanguard the armys jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the army ballistic missile agency under wernher von braun this left nasa firmly as the united statess civil space lead and the air force as the military space lead5 plans for human spaceflight began in the us armed forces prior to nasas creation the air forces man in space soonest project formed in 19566 coupled with the armys project adam served as the foundation for project mercury nasa established the space task group to manage the program7 which would conduct crewed suborbital flights with the armys redstone rockets and orbital flights with the air forces atlas launch vehicles while nasa intended for its first astronauts to be civilians president eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military the mercury 7 astronauts included three air force pilots three navy aviators and one marine corps pilot5 on may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american to enter space performing a suborbital spaceflight in the freedom 78 this flight occurred less than a month after the soviet yuri gagarin became the first human in space executing a full orbital spaceflight nasas first orbital spaceflight was conducted by john glenn on february 20 1962 in the friendship 7 making three full orbits before reentering glenn had to fly parts of his final two orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction9 the sixth and final mercury mission was flown by gordon cooper in may 1963 performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in the faith 710 the mercury program was wildly recognized as a resounding success achieving its objectives to orbit a human in space develop tracking and control systems and identify other issues associated with human spaceflight5 while much of nasas attention turned to space it did not put aside its aeronautics mission early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the x1s supersonic flight to build an aircraft capable of hypersonic flight the north american x15 was a joint nasaus air force program11 with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first nondedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space the x15 also served as a testbed for apollo program technologies as well as ramjet and scramjet propulsion5 escalations in the cold war between the united states and soviet union prompted president john f kennedy to charge nasa with landing an american on the moon and returning him safely to earth by the end of the 1960s and installed james e webb as nasa administrator to achieve this goal12 on may 25 1961 president kennedy openly declared this goal in his urgent national needs speech to the united states congress declaring i believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish kennedy gave his we choose to go to the moon speech the next year on september 12 1962 at rice university where he addressed the nation hoping to reinforce public support for the apollo program13 despite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the moon from the former president dwight eisenhower and 1964 presidential candidate barry goldwater president kennedy was able to protect nasas growing budget of which 50 went directly to human spaceflight and it was later estimated that at its height 5 of americans worked on some aspect of the apollo program5 mirroring the department of defenses program management concept using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental ballistic missiles nasa requested the air force assign major general samuel c phillips to the space agency where he would serve as the director of the apollo program development of the saturn v rocket was led by wernher von braun and his team at the marshall space flight center derived from the army ballistic missile agencys original saturn i the apollo spacecraft was designed and built by north american aviation while the apollo lunar module was designed and built by grumman5 to develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission nasa initiated project gemini14 using a modified air force titan ii launch vehicle the gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks gemini pioneered the use of fuel cells instead of batteries and conducted the first american spacewalks and rendezvous operations the ranger program was started in the 1950s as a response to soviet lunar exploration however most missions ended in failure the lunar orbiter program had greater success mapping the surface in preparation for apollo landings conducting meteoroid detection and measuring radiation levels the surveyor program conducted uncrewed lunar landings and takeoffs as well as taking surface and regolith observations5 despite the setback caused by the apollo 1 fire which killed three astronauts the program proceeded apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times on december 24 and 25 1968 and then traveled safely back to earth151617 the three apollo 8 astronautsfrank borman james lovell and william anderswere the first humans to see the earth as a globe in space the first to witness an earthrise and the first to see and manually photograph the far side of the moon the first lunar landing was conducted by apollo 11 commanded by neil armstrong with astronauts buzz aldrin and michael collins apollo 11 was one of the most significant missions in nasas history marking the end of the space race when the soviet union gave up its lunar ambitions as the first human to step on the surface of the moon neil armstrong uttered the now famous words thats one small step for man one giant leap for mankind nasa would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the apollo program with apollo 17 concluding the program in 19725 wernher von braun had advocated for nasa to develop a space station since the agency was created in 1973 following the end of the apollo lunar missions nasa launched its first space station skylab on the final launch of the saturn v skylab reused a significant amount of apollo and saturn hardware with a repurposed saturn v third stage serving as the primary module for the space station damage to skylab during its launch required spacewalks to be performed by the first crew to make it habitable and operational skylab hosted nine missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and deorbited in 1979 two years prior to the first launch of the space shuttle and any possibility of boosting its orbit5 in 1975 the apollosoyuz mission was the first ever international spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the cold war rivals which also marked the last flight of the apollo capsule5 flown in 1975 a us apollo spacecraft docked with a soviet soyuz capsule during the 1960s nasa started its space science and interplanetary probe program the mariner program was its flagship program launching probes to venus mars and mercury in the 1960s1819 the jet propulsion laboratory was the lead nasa center for robotic interplanetary exploration making significant discoveries about the inner planets despite these successes congress was unwilling to fund further interplanetary missions and nasa administrator james webb suspended all future interplanetary probes to focus resources on the apollo program5 following the conclusion of the apollo program nasa resumed launching interplanetary probes and expanded its space science program the first planet tagged for exploration was venus sharing many similar characteristics to earth first visited by american mariner 2 spacecraft20 venus was observed to be a hot and inhospitable planet followon missions included the pioneer venus project in the 1970s and magellan which performed radar mapping of venus surface in the 1980s and 1990s future missions were flybys of venus on their way to other destinations in the solar system5 mars has long been a planet of intense fascination for nasa being suspected of potentially having harbored life mariner 5 was the first nasa spacecraft to flyby mars21 followed by mariner 6 and mariner 7 mariner 9 was the first orbital mission to mars launched in 1975 viking program consisted of two landings on mars in 1976 followon missions would not be launched until 1996 with the mars global surveyor orbiter and mars pathfinder deploying the first mars rover sojourner22 during the early 2000s the 2001 mars odyssey orbiter reached the planet and in 2004 the sprit and opportunity rovers landed on the red planet this was followed in 2005 by the mars reconnaissance orbiter and 2007 phoenix mars lander the 2012 landing of curiosity discovered that the radiation levels on mars were equal to those on the international space station greatly increasing the possibility of human exploration and observed the key chemical ingredients for life to occur in 2013 the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution maven mission observed the martian upper atmosphere and space environment and in 2018 the interior exploration using seismic investigations geodesy and heat transport insight studied the martian interior the 2021 perseverance rover carried the first extraplanetary aircraft a helicopter named ingenuity5 nasa also launched missions to mercury in 2004 with the messenger probe demonstrating as the first use of a solar sail23 nasa also launched probes to the outer solar system starting in the 1960s pioneer 10 was the first probe to the outer planets flying by jupiter while pioneer 11 provided the first close up view of the planet both probes became the first objects to leave the solar system the voyager program launched in 1977 conducting flybys of jupiter and saturn neptune and uranus on a trajectory to leave the solar system24 the galileo spacecraft deployed from the space shuttle flight sts34 was the first spacecraft to orbit jupiter discovering evidence of subsurface oceans on the europa and observed that the moon may hold ice or liquid water25 a joint nasaeuropean space agencyitalian space agency mission cassinihuygens was sent to saturns moon titan which along with mars and europa are the only celestial bodies in the solar system suspected of being capable of harboring life26 cassini discovered three new moons of saturn and the huygens probe entered titans atmosphere the mission discovered evidence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on titan and subsurface water oceans on the moon of enceladus which could harbor life finally launched in 2006 the new horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit pluto and the kuiper belt5 beyond interplanetary probes nasa has launched many space telescopes launched in the 1960s the orbiting astronomical observatory were nasas first orbital telescopes27 providing ultraviolet gammaray xray and infrared observations nasa launched the orbiting geophysical observatory in the 1960s and 1970s to look down at earth and observe its interactions with the sun the uhuru satellite was the first dedicated xray telescope mapping 85 of the sky and discovering a large number of black holes5 launched in the 1990s and early 2000s the great observatories program are among nasas most powerful telescopes the hubble space telescope was launched in 1990 on sts31 from the discovery and could view galaxies 15 billion light years away28 a major defect in the telescopes mirror could have crippled the program had nasa not used computer enhancement to compensate for the imperfection and launched five space shuttle servicing flights to replace the damaged components the compton gamma ray observatory was launched from the atlantis on sts37 in 1991 discovering a possible source of antimatter at the center of the milky way and observing that the majority of gammaray bursts occur outside of the milky way galaxy the chandra xray observatory was launched from the columbia on sts93 in 1999 observing black holes quasars supernova and dark matter it provided critical observations on the sagittarius a black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy and the separation of dark and regular matter during galactic collisions finally the spitzer space telescope is an infrared telescope launched in 2003 from a delta ii rocket it is in a trailing orbit around the sun following the earth and discovered the existence of brown dwarf stars5 other telescopes such as the cosmic background explorer and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe provided evidence to support the big bang29 the james webb space telescope named after the nasa administrator who lead the apollo program is an infrared observatory launched in 2021 the james webb space telescope is a direct successor to the hubble space telescope intended to observe the formation of the first galaxies30 other space telescopes include the kepler space telescope launched in 2009 to identify planets orbiting extrasolar stars that may be terran and possibly harbor life the first exoplanet that the kepler space telescope confirmed was kepler22b orbiting within the habitable zone of its star5 nasa also launched a number of different satellites to study earth such as television infrared observation satellite tiros in 1960 which was the first weather satellite31 nasa and the united states weather bureau cooperated on future tiros and the second generation nimbus program of weather satellites it also worked with the environmental science services administration on a series of weather satellites and the agency launched its experimental applications technology satellites into geosynchronous orbit nasas first dedicated earth observation satellite landsat was launched in 1972 this led to nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration jointly developing the geostationary operational environmental satellite and discovering ozone depletion5 nasa had been pursuing spaceplane development since the 1960s blending the administrations dual aeronautics and space missions nasa viewed a spaceplane as part of a larger program providing routine and economical logistical support to a space station in earth orbit that would be used as a hub for lunar and mars missions a reusable launch vehicle would then have ended the need for expensive and expendable boosters like the saturn v5 in 1969 nasa designated the johnson space center as the lead center for the design development and manufacturing of the space shuttle orbiter while the marshall space flight center would lead the development of the launch system nasas series of lifting body aircraft culminating in the joint nasaus air force martin marietta x24 directly informed the development of the space shuttle and future hypersonic flight aircraft official development of the space shuttle began in 1972 with rockwell international contracted to design the orbiter and engines martin marietta for the external fuel tank and morton thiokol for the solid rocket boosters32 nasa acquired six orbiters the enterprise columbia challenger discovery atlantis and endeavour5 the space shuttle program also allowed nasa to make major changes to its astronaut corps while almost all previous astronauts were air force or naval test pilots the space shuttle allowed nasa to begin recruiting more nonmilitary scientific and technical experts a prime example is sally ride who became the first american woman to fly in space on sts7 this new astronaut selection process also allowed nasa to accept exchange astronauts from us allies and partners for the first time5 the first space shuttle flight occurred in 1981 when the columbia launched on the sts1 mission designed to serve as a flight test for the new spaceplane33 nasa intended for the space shuttle to replace expendable launch systems like the air forces atlas delta and titan and the european space agencys ariane the space shuttles spacelab payload developed by the european space agency increased the scientific capabilities of shuttle missions over anything nasa was able to previously accomplish5 nasa launched its first commercial satellites on the sts5 mission and in 1984 the sts41c mission conducted the worlds first onorbit satellite servicing mission when the challenger captured and repaired the malfunctioning solar maximum mission satellite it also had the capability to return malfunctioning satellite to earth like it did with the palapa b2 and westar 6 satellites once returned to earth the satellites were repaired and relaunched5 despite ushering in a new era of spaceflight where nasa was contracting launch services to commercial companies the space shuttle was criticized for not being as reusable and costeffective as advertised in 1986 challenger disaster on the sts51l mission resulted in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts on launch grounding the entire space shuttle fleet for 36 months and forced the 44 commercial companies that contracted with nasa to deploy their satellites to return to expendable launch vehicles34 when the space shuttle returned to flight with the sts26 mission it had undergone significant modifications to improve its reliability and safety5 following the collapse of the soviet union the russian federation and united states initiated the shuttlemir program35 the first russian cosmonaut flew on the sts60 mission in 1994 and the discovery rendezvoused but did not dock with the russian mir in the sts63 mission this was followed by atlantis sts71 mission where it accomplished the initial intended mission for the space shuttle docking with a space station and transferring supplies and personnel the shuttlemir program would continue until 1998 when a series of orbital accidents on the space station spelled an end to the program5 in 2003 a second space shuttle was destroyed when the columbia was destroyed upon reentry during the sts107 mission resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts36 this accident marked the beginning of the retiring of the space shuttle program with president george w bush directing that upon the completion of the international space station the space shuttle be retired in 2006 the space shuttle returned to flight conducting several mission to service the hubble space telescope but was retired following the sts135 resupply mission to the international space station in 2011 nasa never gave up on the idea of a space station after skylabs reentry in 1979 the agency began lobbying politicians to support building a larger space station as soon as the space shuttle began flying selling it as an orbital laboratory repair station and a jumping off point for lunar and mars missions nasa found a strong advocate in president ronald reagan who declared in a 1984 speech america has always been greatest when we dared to be great we can reach for greatness again we can follow our dreams to distant stars living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain tonight i am directing nasa to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade in 1985 nasa proposed the space station freedom which both the agency and president reagan intended to be an international program37 while this would add legitimacy to the program there were concerns within nasa that the international component would dilute its authority within the project having never been willing to work with domestic or international partners as true equals there was also a concern with sharing sensitive space technologies with the europeans which had the potential to dilute americas technical lead ultimately an international agreement to develop the space station freedom program would be signed with thirteen countries in 1985 including the european space agency member states canada and japan5 despite its status as the first international space program the space station freedom was controversial with much of the debate centering on cost several redesigns to reduce cost were conducted in the early 1990s stripping away much of its functions despite calls for congress to terminate the program it continued in large part because by 1992 it had created 75000 jobs across 39 states by 1993 president bill clinton attempted to significantly reduce nasas budget and directed costs be significantly reduced aerospace industry jobs were not lost and the russians be included5 in 1993 the clinton administration announced that the space station freedom would become the international space station in an agreement with the russian federation38 this allowed the russians to maintain their space program through an infusion of american currency to maintain their status as one of the two premier space programs while the united states built and launched the majority of the international space station russia canada japan and the european space agency all contributed components despite nasas insistence that costs would be kept at a budget of 174 they kept rising and nasa had to transfer funds from other programs to keep the international space station solvent ultimately the total cost of the station was 150 billion with the united states paying for twothirdsfollowing the space shuttle columbia disaster in 2003 nasa was forced to rely on russian soyuz launches for its astronauts and the 2011 retirement of the space shuttle accelerated the stations completion5 in the 1980s right after the first flight of the space shuttle nasa started a joint program with the department of defense to develop the rockwell x30 national aerospace plane nasa realized that the space shuttle while a massive technological accomplishment would not be able to live up to all its promises designed to be a singlestagetoorbit spaceplane the x30 had both civil and military applications with the end of the cold war the x30 was canceled in 1992 before reaching flight status5 following the space shuttle columbia disaster in 2003 president bush started the constellation program to smoothly replace the space shuttle and expand space exploration beyond low earth orbit39 constellation was intended to use a significant amount of former space shuttle equipment and return astronauts to the moon this program was canceled by the obama administration former astronauts neil armstrong gene cernan and jim lovell sent a letter to president barack obama to warn him that if the united states did not get new human spaceflight ability the us risked become a second or thirdrate space power5 as early as the reagan administration there had been calls for nasa to expand private sector involvement in space exploration rather than do it all inhouse in the 1990s nasa and lockheed martin entered into an agreement to develop the lockheed martin x33 demonstrator of the venturestar spaceplane which was intended to replace the space shuttle40 due to technical challenges the spacecraft was cancelled in 2001 despite this it was the first time a commercial space company directly expended a significant amount of its resources into spacecraft development the advent of space tourism also forced nasa to challenge its assumption that only governments would have people in space the first space tourist was dennis tito an american investment manager and former aerospace engineer who contracted with the russians to fly to the international space station for four days despite the opposition of nasa to the idea5 advocates of this new commercial approach for nasa included former astronaut buzz aldrin who remarked that it would return nasa to its roots as a research and development agency with commercial entities actually operating the space systems having corporations take over orbital operations would also allow nasa to focus all its efforts on deep space exploration and returning humans to the moon and going to mars embracing this approach nasas commercial crew program started by contracting cargo delivery to the international space station and flew its first operational contracted mission on spacex crew1 this marked the first time since the retirement of the space shuttle that nasa was able to launch its own astronauts on an american spacecraft from the united states ending a decade of reliance on the russians5 in 2019 nasa announced the artemis program intending to return to the moon and establish a permanent human presence41 this was paired with the artemis accords with partner nations to establish rules of behavior and norms of space commercialization on the moon42 in 2023 nasa established the moon to mars program office the office is designed to oversee the various projects mission architectures and associated timelines relevant to lunar and mars exploration and science43 the international space station iss combines nasas space station freedom project with the russian mir2 station the european columbus station and the japanese kib laboratory module44 nasa originally planned in the 1980s to develop freedom alone but us budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multinational program in 1993 managed by nasa the russian federal space agency rka the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa the european space agency esa and the canadian space agency csa4546 the station consists of pressurized modules external trusses solar arrays and other components which were manufactured in various factories around the world and launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and the american space shuttle44 the onorbit assembly began in 1998 the completion of the us orbital segment occurred in 2009 and the completion of the russian orbital segment occurred in 2010 the ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements47 which divide the station into two areas and allow russia to retain full ownership of the russian orbital segment with the exception of zarya4849 with the us orbital segment allocated between the other international partners47 longduration missions to the iss are referred to as iss expeditions expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the iss50 the initial expedition crew size was three temporarily decreased to two following the columbia disaster between may 2009 and until the retirement of the space shuttle the expedition crew size has been six crew members51 as of 2024 though the commercial programs crew capsules can allow a crew of up to seven expeditions using them typically consist of a crew of four the iss has been continuously occupied for the past 24 years and 306 days having exceeded the previous record held by mir and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations5253 the station can be seen from the earth with the naked eye and as of 2025 is the largest artificial satellite in earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station54 the russian soyuz and american dragon and starliner spacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from the iss several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the iss they are the russian progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000 the european automated transfer vehicle atv since 2008 the japanese hii transfer vehicle htv since 2009 the uncrewed dragon since 2012 and the american cygnus spacecraft since 20135556 the space shuttle before its retirement was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay between the retirement of the shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed dragon flights in 2020 american astronauts exclusively used the soyuz for crew transport to and from the iss57 the highest number of people occupying the iss has been thirteen this occurred three times during the late shuttle iss assembly missions58 the iss program is expected to continue until 203059 after which the space station will be retired and destroyed in a controlled deorbit60 commercial resupply services crs are a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the international space station on a commercial basis by private companies61 nasa signed its first crs contracts in 2008 and awarded 16 billion to spacex for twelve cargo dragon and 19 billion to orbital sciencesnote 1 for eight cygnus flights covering deliveries until 2016 both companies evolved or created their launch vehicle products to launch the spacecrafts spacex with the falcon 9 and orbital with the antares spacex flew its first operational resupply mission spacex crs1 in 201262 orbital sciences followed in 2014 cygnus crs orb163 in 2015 nasa extended crs1 to twenty flights for spacex and twelve flights for orbital atknote 16465 a second phase of contracts known as crs2 was solicited in 2014 contracts were awarded in january 2016 to orbital atknote 1 cygnus sierra nevada corporation dream chaser and spacex dragon 2 for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024 in march 2022 nasa awarded an additional six crs2 missions each to both spacex and northrop grumman formerly orbital66 northrop grumman successfully delivered cygnus ng17 to the iss in february 202267 in july 2022 spacex launched its 25th crs flight spacex crs25 and successfully delivered its cargo to the iss68 the dream chaser spacecraft is currently scheduled for its demo1 launch in the first half of 202469 the commercial crew program ccp provides commercially operated crew transportation service to and from the international space station iss under contract to nasa conducting crew rotations between the expeditions of the international space station program american space manufacturer spacex began providing service in 2020 using the crew dragon spacecraft70 while boeings starliner spacecraft provided service in 2024 it was on contract for 6 missions but after the first mission nearly ended in disaster and left the two astronauts stranded on the iss for six months nasa froze its contract with boeing71727374 nasa has contracted for six operational missions from boeing and fourteen from spacex ensuring sufficient support for iss through 203075 the spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor and crew transportation is provided to nasa as a commercial service76 each mission sends up to four astronauts to the iss with an option for a fifth passenger available operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months a spacecraft remains docked to the iss during its mission and missions usually overlap by at least a few days between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and the first operational ccp mission in 2020 nasa relied on the soyuz program to transport its astronauts to the iss a crew dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a falcon 9 block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to earth via splashdown in the ocean near florida the programs first operational mission spacex crew1 launched on november 16 202077 boeing starliner operational flights will now commence with boeing starliner1 which will launched atop an atlas v n22 launch vehicle instead of a splashdown starliner capsules return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western united states78 since 2017 nasas crewed spaceflight program has been the artemis program which involves the help of us commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as esa jaxa and csa79 the goal of this program is to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar south pole region by 2025 artemis would be the first step towards the longterm goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the moon laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy and eventually sending humans to mars the orion crew exploration vehicle was held over from the canceled constellation program for artemis artemis i was the uncrewed initial launch of space launch system sls that would also send an orion spacecraft on a distant retrograde orbit80 the first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be artemis ii which is to include the orion crew module propelled by the sls and is expected to launch no later than april 2026817982 this mission is to be a 10day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a lunar flyby83 artemis iii aims to conduct the first crewed lunar landing since apollo 17 and is scheduled for no earlier than mid2027citation needed in support of the artemis missions nasa has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as the commercial lunar payload services as of march 2022 nasa has awarded contracts for robotic lunar probes to companies such as intuitive machines firefly space systems and astrobotic84 on april 16 2021 nasa announced they had selected the spacex lunar starship as its human landing system the agencys space launch system rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the orion spacecraft for their multiday journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to spacexs starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the moon85 in november 2021 it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2027 due to numerous factors artemis i launched on november 16 2022 and returned to earth safely on december 11 2022 as of april 2025 nasa plans to launch artemis ii in april 202686 and artemis iii in 202787 additional artemis missions artemis iv artemis v and artemis vi are planned to launch between 2028 and 203188 nasas next major space initiative is the construction of the lunar gateway a small space station in lunar orbit89 this space station will be designed primarily for noncontinuous human habitation the construction of the gateway is expected to begin in 2027 with the launch of the first two modules the power and propulsion element ppe and the habitation and logistics outpost halo90 operations on the gateway will begin with the artemis iv mission which plans to deliver a crew of four to the gateway in 2028 in 2017 nasa was directed by the congressional nasa transition authorization act of 2017 to get humans to marsorbit or to the martian surface by the 2030s9192 the commercial low earth orbit destinations program is an initiative by nasa to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the international space station the three selected companies are blue origin et al with their orbital reef station concept nanoracks et al with their starlab space station concept and northrop grumman with a station concept based on the halomodule for the gateway station93 nasa has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history more than 1000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system94 nasa executes a mission development framework to plan select develop and operate robotic missions this framework defines cost schedule and technical risk parameters to enable competitive selection of missions involving mission candidates that have been developed by principal investigators and their teams from across nasa the broader us government research and development stakeholders and industry the mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs95 the explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the us space program in current form the program consists of three classes of systems small explorers smex medium explorers midex and universityclass explorers unex missions the nasa explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas the small explorer missions are required to limit cost to nasa to below 150m 2022 dollars medium class explorer missions have typically involved nasa cost caps of 350m the explorer program office is based at nasa goddard space flight center96 the nasa discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain discovery enables scientists and engineers to assemble a team to deliver a solution against a defined set of objectives and competitively bid that solution against other candidate programs cost caps vary but recent mission selection processes were accomplished using a 500m cost cap for nasa the planetary mission program office is based at the nasa marshall space flight center and manages both the discovery and new frontiers missions the office is part of the science mission directorate97 nasa administrator bill nelson announced on june 2 2021 that the davinci and veritas missions were selected to launch to venus in the late 2020s having beat out competing proposals for missions to jupiters volcanic moon io and neptunes large moon triton that were also selected as discovery program finalists in early 2020 each mission has an estimated cost of 500 million with launches expected between 2028 and 2030 launch contracts will be awarded later in each missions development98 the new frontiers program focuses on specific solar system exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community primary objectives include solar system exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct highsciencereturn investigations new frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with discovery cost caps vary by opportunity recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of 1 billion the higher cost cap and projected longer mission durations result in a lower frequency of new opportunities for the program typically one every several years osirisrex and new horizons are examples of new frontiers missions99 nasa has determined that the next opportunity to propose for the fifth round of new frontiers missions will occur no later than the fall of 2024 missions in nasas new frontiers program tackle specific solar system exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community exploring the solar system with mediumclass spacecraft missions that conduct highsciencereturn investigations is nasas strategy to further understand the solar system100 large strategic missions formerly called flagship missions are strategic missions that are typically developed and managed by large teams that may span several nasa centers the individual missions become the program as opposed to being part of a larger effort see discovery new frontiers etc the james webb space telescope is a strategic mission that was developed over a period of more than 20 years strategic missions are developed on an adhoc basis as program objectives and priorities are established missions like voyager had they been developed today would have been strategic missions three of the great observatories were strategic missions the chandra xray observatory the compton gamma ray observatory and the hubble space telescope europa clipper is the next large strategic mission in development by nasa101 nasa continues to play a material role in exploration of the solar system as it has for decades ongoing missions have current science objectives with respect to more than five extraterrestrial bodies within the solar

laser stations on the ground ogs called lasercom rf networks for satellite communications160 water extraction from lunar soil on july 29 2020 nasa requested american universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from the lunar soil and developing power systems the idea will help the space agency conduct sustainable exploration of the moon161 in 2024 nasa was tasked by the us government to create a time standard for the moon the standard is to be called coordinated lunar time and is expected to be finalized in 2026162 nasas human research program hrp is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration163 the medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low earth orbit or in travel to the moon travel to mars is significantly longer and deeper into space significant medical issues can result these include bone density loss radiation exposure vision changes circadian rhythm disturbances heart remodeling and immune alterations in order to study and diagnose these illeffects hrp has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass volume and power to monitor the health of astronauts164 to achieve this aim on may 13 2022 nasa and spacex crew4 astronauts successfully tested its rhealth one universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers cells microorganisms and proteins in a spaceflight environment165 nasa established the planetary defense coordination office pdco in 2016 to catalog and track potentially hazardous nearearth objects neo such as asteroids and comets and develop potential responses and defenses against these threats166 the pdco is chartered to provide timely and accurate information to the government and the public on close approaches by potentially hazardous objects phos and any potential for impact the office functions within the science mission directorate planetary science division167 the pdco augmented prior cooperative actions between the united states the european union and other nations which had been scanning the sky for neos since 1998 in an effort called spaceguard168 from the 1990s nasa has run many neo detection programs from earth bases observatories greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected many asteroids are very dark and those near the sun are much harder to detect from earthbased telescopes which observe at night and thus face away from the sun neos inside earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a full moon when they are behind the earth and fully lit by the sun169 in 1998 the united states congress gave nasa a mandate to detect 90 of nearearth asteroids over 1 km 062 mi diameter that threaten global devastation by 2008170 this initial mandate was met by 2011171 in 2005 the original usa spaceguard mandate was extended by the george e brown jr nearearth object survey act which calls for nasa to detect 90 of neos with diameters of 140 m 460 ft or greater by 2020 compare to the 20meter chelyabinsk meteor that hit russia in 2013172 as of january 2020update it is estimated that less than half of these have been found but objects of this size hit the earth only about once in 2000 years173 in january 2020 nasa officials estimated it would take 30 years to find all objects meeting the 140 m 460 ft size criteria more than twice the timeframe that was built into the 2005 mandate174 in june 2021 nasa authorized the development of the neo surveyor spacecraft to reduce that projected duration to achieve the mandate down to 10 years175176 nasa has incorporated planetary defense objectives into several ongoing missions in 1999 nasa visited 433 eros with the near shoemaker spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000 closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time177 near shoemaker became the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid improving our understanding of these bodies and demonstrating our capacity to study them in greater detail178 osirisrex used its suite of instruments to transmit radio tracking signals and capture optical images of bennu during its study of the asteroid that will help nasa scientists determine its precise position in the solar system and its exact orbital path as bennu has the potential for recurring approaches to the earthmoon system in the next 100200 years the precision gained from osirisrex will enable scientists to better predict the future gravitational interactions between bennu and our planet and resultant changes in bennus onward flight path179180 the wiseneowise mission was launched by nasa jpl in 2009 as an infraredwavelength astronomical space telescope in 2013 nasa repurposed it as the neowise mission to find potentially hazardous nearearth asteroids and comets its mission has been extended into 2023181182 nasa and johns hopkins applied physics laboratory jhapl jointly developed the first planetary defense purposebuilt satellite the double asteroid redirection test dart to test possible planetary defense concepts183 dart was launched in november 2021 by a spacex falcon 9 from california on a trajectory designed to impact the dimorphos asteroid scientists were seeking to determine whether an impact could alter the subsequent path of the asteroid a concept that could be applied to future planetary defense184 on september 26 2022 dart hit its target in the weeks following impact nasa declared dart a success confirming it had shortened dimorphos orbital period around didymos by about 32 minutes surpassing the predefined success threshold of 73 seconds185186 neo surveyor formerly called the nearearth object camera neocam mission is a spacebased infrared telescope under development to survey the solar system for potentially hazardous asteroids187 the spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026 in june 2022 the head of the nasa science mission directorate thomas zurbuchen confirmed the start of nasas uap independent study team188 at a speech before the national academies of science engineering and medicine zurbuchen said the space agency would bring a scientific perspective to efforts already underway by the pentagon and intelligence agencies to make sense of dozens of such sightings he said it was highrisk highimpact research that the space agency should not shy away from even if it is a controversial field of study189 in response to the apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967 congress directed nasa to form an aerospace safety advisory panel asap to advise the nasa administrator on safety issues and hazards in nasas air and space programs in the aftermath of the shuttle columbia disaster congress required that the asap submit an annual report to the nasa administrator and to congress190 by 1971 nasa had also established the space program advisory council and the research and technology advisory council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support in 1977 the latter two were combined to form the nasa advisory council nac191 the nasa authorization act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of asap nasa and noaa have cooperated for decades on the development delivery and operation of polar and geosynchronous weather satellites192 the relationship typically involves nasa developing the space systems launch solutions and ground control technology for the satellites and noaa operating the systems and delivering weather forecasting products to users multiple generations of noaa polar orbiting platforms have operated to provide detailed imaging of weather from low altitude193 geostationary operational environmental satellites goes provide nearrealtime coverage of the western hemisphere to ensure accurate and timely understanding of developing weather phenomenon194 the united states space force ussf is the space service branch of the united states armed forces while the national aeronautics and space administration nasa is an independent agency of the united states government responsible for civil spaceflight nasa and the space forces predecessors in the air force have a longstanding cooperative relationship with the space force supporting nasa launches out of kennedy space center cape canaveral space force station and vandenberg space force base to include range support and rescue operations from task force 45195 nasa and the space force also partner on matters such as defending earth from asteroids196 space force members can be nasa astronauts with colonel michael s hopkins the commander of spacex crew1 commissioned into the space force from the international space station on december 18 2020197198199 in september 2020 the space force and nasa signed a memorandum of understanding formally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies this new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between nasa and air force space command200201 the landsat program is the longestrunning enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of earth it is a joint nasa usgs program202 on july 23 1972 the earth resources technology satellite was launched this was eventually renamed to landsat 1 in 1975203 the most recent satellite in the series

development and operation of the international space station since september 1993217 the agencies have used launch systems from both countries to deliver station elements to orbit astronauts and cosmonauts jointly maintain various elements of the station both countries provide access to the station via launch systems noting russias unique role as the sole provider of delivery of crew and cargo upon retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and prior to commencement of nasa cots and crew flights in july 2022 nasa and roscosmos signed a deal to share space station flights enabling crew from each country to ride on the systems provided by the other218 current geopolitical conditions in late 2022 make it unlikely that cooperation will be extended to other programs such as artemis or lunar exploration219 the artemis accords have been established to define a framework for cooperating in the peaceful exploration and exploitation of the moon mars asteroids and comets the accords were drafted by nasa and the us state department and are executed as a series of bilateral agreements between the united states and the participating countries220221 as of june 2023 22 countries have signed the accords they are australia bahrain brazil canada colombia france india israel italy japan the republic of korea luxembourg mexico new zealand poland romania the kingdom of saudi arabia singapore ukraine the united arab emirates the united kingdom and the united states222223 the wolf amendment was passed by the us congress into law in 2011 and prevents nasa from engaging in direct bilateral cooperation with the chinese government and chinaaffiliated organizations such as the china national space administration without the explicit authorization from congress and the federal bureau of investigation the law has been renewed annually since by inclusion in annual appropriations bills224 the agencys administration is located at nasa headquarters in washington dc and provides overall guidance and direction225 except under exceptional circumstances nasa civil service employees are required to be us citizens226 nasas administrator is nominated by the president of the united states subject to the approval of the us senate227 and serves at the presidents pleasure as a senior space science advisor the current interim administrator is transportation secretary sean duffy appointed by president donald trump the administrations original nominee of jared isaacman was withdrawn on may 31 2025228 nasa operates with four fy2022 strategic goals229 nasa budget requests are developed by nasa and approved by the administration prior to submission to the us congress authorized budgets are those that have been included in enacted appropriations bills that are approved by both houses of congress and enacted into law by the us president230 nasa fiscal year budget requests and authorized budgets are listed below nasa funding and priorities are developed through its six mission directorates centerwide activities such as the chief engineer and safety and mission assurance organizations are aligned to the headquarters function the msd budget estimate includes funds for these hq functions the administration operates 10 major field centers with several managing additional subordinate facilities across the country each center is led by a director data below valid as of december 23 2024 the exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems both in earths atmosphere and in space can adversely affect the earths environment some hypergolic rocket propellants such as hydrazine are highly toxic prior to combustion but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning rockets using hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust256 carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources on average the united states consumed 803 million us gal 30 million m3 of liquid fuels per day in 2014 while a single falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25000 us gallons 95 m3 of kerosene fuel per launch257258 even if a falcon 9 were launched every single day it would only represent 0006 of liquid fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for that day additionally the exhaust from lox and lh2 fueled engines like the ssme is almost entirely water vapor259 nasa addressed environmental concerns with its canceled constellation program in accordance with the national environmental policy act in 2011260 in contrast ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion261262 an example of nasas environmental efforts is the nasa sustainability base additionally the exploration sciences building was awarded the leed gold rating in 2010263 on may 8 2003 the environmental protection agency recognized nasa as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilitiesthe goddard space flight center greenbelt maryland264 in 2018 nasa along with other companies including sensor coating systems pratt whitney monitor coating and utrc launched the project caution coatings for ultra high temperature detection this project aims to enhance the temperature range of the thermal history coating up to 1500 c 2730 f and beyond the final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing co2 emissions265 nasa also researches and publishes on climate change266 its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the climate is warming267 bob walker who has advised former us president donald trump on space issues has advocated that nasa should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as noaa former nasa atmospheric scientist j marshall shepherd countered that earth science study was built into nasas mission at its creation in the 1958 national aeronautics and space act268 nasa won the 2020 webby peoples voice award for green in the category web269 educational launch of nanosatellites elana since 2011 the elana program has provided opportunities for nasa to work with university teams to test emerging technologies and commercialofftheshelf solutions by providing launch opportunities for developed cubesats using nasa procured launch opportunities270 by example two nasasponsored cubesats launched in june 2022 on a virgin orbit launcherone vehicle as the elana 39 mission271 cubes in space nasa started an annual competition in 2014 named cubes in space272 it is jointly organized by nasa and the global education company i doodle learning with the objective of teaching school students aged 1118 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a nasa rocket or balloon on june 21 2017 the worlds smallest satellite kalamsat was launched273 us law requires the international system of units to be used in all us government programs except where impractical274 in 1969 apollo 11 landed on the moon using a mix of united states customary units and metric units in the 1980s nasa started the transition towards the metric system but was still using both systems in the 1990s275276 on september 23 1999 a mixup between nasas use of si units and lockheed martin spaces use of us units resulted in the loss of the mars climate orbiter277 in august 2007 nasa stated that all future missions and explorations of the moon would be done entirely using the si system this was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system278 as of 2007 nasa is predominantly working with si units but some projects still use us units and some including the international space station use a mix of both279 approaching 40 years of service the nasa tv channel airs content ranging from live coverage of crewed missions to video coverage of significant milestones for operating robotic spacecraft eg rover landings on mars and domestic and international launches280 the channel is delivered by nasa and is broadcast by satellite and over the internet the system initially started to capture archival footage of important space events for nasa managers and engineers and expanded as public interest grew the apollo 8 christmas eve broadcast while in orbit around the moon was received by more than a billion people281 nasas video transmission of the apollo 11 moon landing was awarded a primetime emmy in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the landing282 the channel is a product of the us government and is widely available across many television and internet platforms283 nasacast is the official audio and video podcast of the nasa website created in late 2005 the podcast service contains the latest audio and
