physics is the scientific study of matter its fundamental constituents its motion and behavior through space and time and the related entities of energy and force1 it is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines234 a scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines5 over much of the past two millennia physics chemistry biology and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research such as biophysics and quantum chemistry and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined new ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences2 and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy advances in physics often enable new technologies for example advances in the understanding of electromagnetism solidstate physics and nuclear physics led directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society such as television computers domestic appliances and nuclear weapons2 advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus the word physics comes from the latin physica study of nature which itself is a borrowing of the greek phusik natural science a term derived from phsis origin nature property678 astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences early civilizations dating before 3000 bce such as the sumerians ancient egyptians and the indus valley civilization had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the sun moon and stars the stars and planets believed to represent gods were often worshipped while the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky5 which could not explain the positions of the planets according to asger aaboe the origins of western astronomy can be found in mesopotamia and all western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late babylonian astronomy9 egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies10 while greek poet homer wrote of various celestial objects in his iliad and odyssey later greek astronomers provided names which are still used today for most constellations visible from the northern hemisphere11 natural philosophy has its origins in greece during the archaic period 650 bce 480 bce when presocratic philosophers like thales rejected nonnaturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause12 they proposed ideas verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment13 for example atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by leucippus and his pupil democritus14 during the classical period in greece 6th 5th and 4th centuries bce and in hellenistic times natural philosophy developed along many lines of inquiry aristotle greek aristotls 384322 bce a student of plato wrote on many subjects including a substantial treatise on physics in the 4th century bc aristotelian physics was influential for about two millennia his approach mixed some limited observation with logical deductive arguments but did not rely on experimental verification of deduced statements aristotles foundational work in physics though very imperfect formed a framework against which later thinkers further developed the field his approach is entirely superseded today he explained ideas such as motion and gravity with the theory of four elements aristotle believed that each of the four classical elements air fire water earth had its own natural place15 because of their differing densities each element will revert to its own specific place in the atmosphere16 so because of their weights fire would be at the top air underneath fire then water then lastly earth he also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another the less abundant element will automatically go towards its own natural place for example if there is a fire on the ground the flames go up into the air in an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs his laws of motion included that heavier objects will fall faster the speed being proportional to the weight and the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is falling through eg density of air17 he also stated that when it comes to violent motion motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object that the speed that object moves will only be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it17 the problem of motion and its causes was studied carefully leading to the philosophical notion of a prime mover as the ultimate source of all motion in the world book 8 of his treatise physics the western roman empire fell to invaders and internal decay in the fifth century resulting in a decline in intellectual pursuits in western europe by contrast the eastern roman empire usually known as the byzantine empire resisted the attacks from invaders and continued to advance various fields of learning including physics19 in the sixth century john philoponus challenged the dominant aristotelian approach to science although much of his work was focused on christian theology20 in the sixth century isidore of miletus created an important compilation of archimedes works that are copied in the archimedes palimpsest islamic scholarship inherited aristotelian physics from the greeks and during the islamic golden age developed it further especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning developing early forms of the scientific method the most notable innovations under islamic scholarship were in the field of optics and vision21 which came from the works of many scientists like ibn sahl alkindi ibn alhaytham alfarisi and avicenna the most notable work was the book of optics also known as kitb almanir written by ibn alhaytham in which he presented the alternative to the ancient greek idea about vision22 his discussed his experiments with camera obscura showing that light moved in a straight line he encouraged readers to reproduce his experiments making him one of the originators of the scientific method2324 physics became a separate science when early modern europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics25page needed major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with the heliocentric copernican model the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by johannes kepler between 1609 and 1619 galileos pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th centuries and isaac newtons discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name26 newton and separately gottfried wilhelm leibniz developed calculus27 the mathematical study of continuous change and newton applied it to solve physical problems28 the discovery of laws in thermodynamics chemistry and electromagnetics resulted from research efforts during the industrial revolution as energy needs increased30 by the end of the 19th century theories of thermodynamics mechanics and electromagnetics matched a wide variety of observations taken together these theories became the basis for what would later be called classical physics31 2 a few experimental results remained inexplicable classical electromagnetism presumed a medium an luminiferous aether to support the propagation of waves but this medium could not be detected the intensity of light from hot glowing blackbody objects did not match the predictions of thermodynamics and electromagnetism the character of electron emission of illuminated metals differed from predictions these failures seemingly insignificant in the big picture would upset the physics world in first two decades of the 20th century31 modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of max planck in quantum theory and albert einsteins theory of relativity both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light depends on the motion of the observer which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by maxwells equations of electromagnetism this discrepancy was corrected by einsteins theory of special relativity which replaced classical mechanics for fastmoving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light35 blackbody radiation provided another problem for classical physics which was corrected when planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency this along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals led to the theory of quantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales36 quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by werner heisenberg erwin schrdinger and paul dirac36 from this early work and work in related fields the standard model of particle physics was derived37 following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the higgs boson at cern in 201238 all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model and no others appear to exist however physics beyond the standard model with theories such as supersymmetry is an active area of research39 areas of mathematics in general are important to this field such as the study of probabilities and groups physics deals with a wide variety of systems although certain theories are used by all physicists each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature these central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics and any physicist regardless of their specialization is expected to be literate in them these include classical mechanics quantum mechanics thermodynamics and statistical mechanics electromagnetism and special relativity in the first decades of the 20th century physics was revolutionized by the discoveries of quantum mechanics and relativity the changes were so fundamental that these new concepts became the foundation of modern physics with other topics becoming classical physics the majority of applications of physics are essentially classical40 xxxi the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light40 xxxii outside of this domain observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics31 6 classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and welldeveloped before the beginning of the 20th centuryclassical mechanics thermodynamics and electromagnetism31 2 classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration kinematics study of motion without regard to its causes and dynamics study of motion and the forces that affect it mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics known together as continuum mechanics the latter include such branches as hydrostatics hydrodynamics and pneumatics acoustics is the study of how sound is produced controlled transmitted and received41 important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing bioacoustics the physics of animal calls and hearing42 and electroacoustics the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics43 optics the study of light is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility eg reflection refraction interference diffraction dispersion and polarization of light heat is a form of energy the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest electrodynamics with moving charges and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest the discovery of relativity and of quantum mechanics in the first decades of the 20th century transformed the conceptual basis of physics without reducing the practical value of most of the physical theories developed up to that time consequently the topics of physics have come to be divided into classical physics and modern physics with the latter category including effects related to quantum mechanics and relativity31 2 classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale for example atomic and nuclear physics study matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified the physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter this branch of physics is also known as highenergy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators on this scale ordinary commonsensical notions of space time matter and energy are no longer valid44 the two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space time and matter from that presented by classical physics classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena the theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in many areas of modern physics45 fundamental concepts in modern physics include physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory by using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical unbiased and repeatable way to that end experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of a theory46 a scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory such as newtons law of universal gravitation47 theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena although theory and experiment are developed separately they strongly affect and depend upon each other progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories prompting intense focus on applicable modeling and when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions which inspire the development of new experiments and often related equipment48 physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory49 theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy electromagnetism was unified this waya beyond the known universe the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issuesb such as parallel universes a multiverse and higher dimensions theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions experimental physics expands and is expanded by engineering and technology experimental physicists who are involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and transistors feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists50 physics covers a wide range of phenomena from elementary particles such as quarks neutrinos and electrons to the largest superclusters of galaxies included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things therefore physics is sometimes called the fundamental science51 physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena thus physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes and then connect these causes together for example the ancient chinese observed that certain rocks lodestone and magnetite were attracted to one another by an invisible force this effect was later called magnetism which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century but even before the chinese discovered magnetism the ancient greeks knew of other objects such as amber that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two52 this was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity thus physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause electricity and magnetism however further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one forceelectromagnetism this process of unifying forces continues today and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction physics hopes to find an ultimate reason theory of everything for why nature is as it is see section current research below for more information53 research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts in condensed matter physics an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of hightemperature superconductivity54 many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers5556 in particle physics the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model have begun to appear foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have nonzero mass these experimental results appear to have solved the longstanding solar neutrino problem and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research the large hadron collider has already found the higgs boson but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry which extends the standard model of particle physics research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing57 although much progress has been made in highenergy quantum and astronomical physics many everyday phenomena involving complexity58 chaos59 or turbulence60 are still poorly understood complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved examples include the formation of sandpiles nodes in trickling water the shape of water droplets mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes and selfsorting in shaken heterogeneous collectionsc61 these complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems in the 1932 annual review of fluid mechanics horace lamb said62 i am an old man now and when i die and go to heaven there are two matters on which i hope for enlightenment one is quantum electrodynamics and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids and about the former i am rather optimistic the major fields of physics along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ are shown in the following table since the 20th century the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialized and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers universalists such as einstein 18791955 and lev landau 19081968 who worked in multiple fields of physics are now very rared contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics condensed matter physics atomic molecular and optical physics astrophysics and applied physics some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach63 particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them64 in addition particle physicists design and develop the highenergy accelerators65 detectors66 and computer programs67 necessary for this research the field is also called highenergy physics because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during highenergy collisions of other particles68 currently the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the standard model69 the model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter quarks and leptons that interact via the strong weak and electromagnetic fundamental forces69 dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons gluons w and z bosons and photons respectively70 the standard model also predicts a particle known as the higgs boson69 in july 2012 cern the european laboratory for particle physics announced the detection of a particle consistent with the higgs boson71 an integral part of the higgs mechanism nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei the most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology but the research has provided application in many fields including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging ion implantation in materials engineering and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology atomic molecular and optical physics amo is the study of mattermatter and lightmatter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules the three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships the similarity of methods used and the commonality of their relevant energy scales all three areas include both classical semiclassical and quantum treatments they can treat their subject from a microscopic view in contrast to a macroscopic view atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms current research focuses on activities in quantum control cooling and trapping of atoms and ions727374 lowtemperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus see hyperfine splitting but intranuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics molecular physics focuses on multiatomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter7576 in particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong55 the most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms77 more exotic condensed phases include the superfluid78 and the boseeinstein condensate79 found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials80 and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices81 condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics historically condensed matter physics grew out of solidstate physics which is now considered one of its main subfields82 the term condensed matter physics was apparently coined by philip anderson when he renamed his research grouppreviously solidstate theoryin 196783 in 1978 the division of solid state physics of the american physical society was renamed as the division of condensed matter physics82 condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry materials science nanotechnology and engineering55 astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure stellar evolution the origin of the solar system and related problems of cosmology because astrophysics is a broad subject astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics including mechanics electromagnetism statistical mechanics thermodynamics quantum mechanics relativity nuclear and particle physics and atomic and molecular physics84 the discovery by karl jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy most recently the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration perturbations and interference from the earths atmosphere make spacebased observations necessary for infrared ultraviolet gammaray and xray astronomy physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales albert einsteins theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories in the early 20th century hubbles discovery that the universe is expanding as shown by the hubble diagram prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the big bang the big bang was confirmed by the success of big bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964 the big bang model rests on two theoretical pillars albert einsteins general relativity and the cosmological principle cosmologists have recently established the cdm model of the evolution of the universe which includes cosmic inflation dark energy and dark matter a physicist is a scientist who specializes in the field of physics which encompasses the interactions of matter and energy at all length and time scales in the physical universe8586 physicists generally are interested in the root or ultimate causes of phenomena and usually frame their understanding in mathematical terms they work across a wide range of research fields spanning all length scales from subatomic and particle physics through biological physics to cosmological length scales encompassing the universe as a whole the field generally includes two types of physicists experimental physicists who specialize in the observation of natural phenomena and the development and analysis of experiments and theoretical physicists who specialize in mathematical modeling of physical systems to rationalize explain and predict natural phenomena85 physics as with the rest of science relies on the philosophy of science and its scientific method to advance knowledge of the physical world90 the scientific method employs a priori and a posteriori reasoning as well as the use of bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory91 study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics the philosophy of physics involves issues such as the nature of space and time determinism and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism naturalism and realism92 many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work for instance laplace who championed causal determinism93 and erwin schrdinger who wrote on quantum mechanics9495 the mathematical physicist roger penrose has been called a platonist by stephen hawking96 a view penrose discusses in his book the road to reality97 hawking referred to himself as an unashamed reductionist and took issue with penroses views98 mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature this was noted and advocated by pythagoras99 plato100 galileo101 and newton some theorists like hilary putnam and penelope maddy hold that logical truths and therefore mathematical reasoning depend on the empirical world this is usually combined with the claim that the laws of logic express universal regularities found in the structural features of the world which may explain the peculiar relation between these fields physics uses mathematics102 to organize and formulate experimental results from those results precise or estimated solutions are obtained or quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated the results from physics experiments are numerical data with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements technologies based on mathematics like computation have made computational physics an active area of research ontology is a prerequisite for physics but not for mathematics it means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns even beyond the real world thus physics statements are synthetic while mathematical statements are analytic mathematics contains hypotheses while physics contains theories mathematics statements have to be only logically true while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data the distinction is clearcut but not always obvious for example mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics its methods are mathematical but its subject is physical103 the problems in this field start with a mathematical model of a physical situation system and a mathematical description of a physical law that will be applied to that system every mathematical statement used for solving has a hardtofind physical meaning the final mathematical solution has an easiertofind meaning because it is what the solver is looking forclarification needed physics is a branch of fundamental science also called basic science physics is also called the fundamental science because all branches of natural science including chemistry astronomy geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics51 similarly chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences for example chemistry studies properties structures and reactions of matter chemistrys focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other properties include physical characteristics of given substances and reactions are bound by laws of physics like conservation of energy mass and charge fundamental physics seeks to better explain and understand phenomena in all spheres without a specific practical application as a goal other than the deeper insight into the phenomema themselves applied physics is a general term for physics research and development that is intended for a particular use an applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline like geology or electrical engineering it usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem the approach is similar to that of applied mathematics applied physicists use physics in scientific research for instance people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics physics is used heavily in engineering for example statics a subfield of mechanics is used in the building of bridges and other static structures the understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls similarly the use of optics creates better optical devices an understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators video games and movies and is often critical in forensic investigations with the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty for example in the study of the origin of the earth a physicist can reasonably model earths mass temperature and rate of rotation as a function of time allowing the extrapolation forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events it also allows for simulations in engineering that speed up the development of a new technology there is also considerable interdisciplinarity so many other important fields are influenced by physics eg the fields of econophysics and sociophysics
