spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites inspace propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry several methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed each having its own drawbacks and advantages most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters often monopropellant rockets or resistojet rockets for orbital stationkeeping while a few use momentum wheels for attitude control russian and antecedent soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades1 and newer western geoorbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for northsouth stationkeeping and orbit raising interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and halleffect thrusters various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to mars hypothetical inspace propulsion technologies describe propulsion technologies that could meet future space science and exploration needs these propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of the solar system and may permit mission designers to plan missions to fly anytime anywhere and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations and with greater reliability and safety with a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies the question of which technologies are best for future missions is a difficult one expert opinion now holds that a portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations234 the primary goals of space exploration are to reach the destination safely quickly with a large quantity of payload mass and relatively inexpensively the act of reaching the destination requires an inspace propulsion system and the other metrics are modifiers to this fundamental action54 propulsion technologies can significantly improve a number of critical aspects of the mission when launching a spacecraft from earth a propulsion method must overcome a higher gravitational pull to provide a positive net acceleration6 when in space the purpose of a propulsion system is to change the velocity or v of a spacecraft in order to establish the desired trajectory7 inspace propulsion begins where the upper stage of the launch vehicle leaves off performing the functions of primary propulsion reaction control station keeping precision pointing and orbital maneuvering the main engines used in space provide the primary propulsive force for orbit transfer planetary trajectories and extra planetary landing and ascent the reaction control and orbital maneuvering systems provide the propulsive force for orbit maintenance position control station keeping and spacecraft attitude control534 in orbit any additional impulse even tiny will result in a change in the orbit path in two ways8 earths surface is situated fairly deep in a gravity well the escape velocity required to leave its orbit is 112 kilometerssecond11 thus for destinations beyond propulsion systems need enough propellant and to be of high enough efficiency the same is true for other planets and moons albeit some have lower gravity wells as human beings evolved in a gravitational field of one g 981ms it would be most comfortable for a human spaceflight propulsion system to provide that acceleration continuouslyaccording to whom though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods12 the occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from the ill effects of free fall such as nausea muscular weakness reduced sense of taste or leaching of calcium from their bones1314 the tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows using the law of conservation of momentum that for a rocket engine propulsion method to change the momentum of a spacecraft it must change the momentum of something else in the opposite direction in other words the rocket must exhaust mass opposite the spacecrafts acceleration direction with such exhausted mass called propellant or reaction mass15 sec 121 16 for this to happen both reaction mass and energy are needed the impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass with mass m at velocity v is mv but this particle has kinetic energy mv2 which must come from somewhere in a conventional solid liquid or hybrid rocket fuel is burned providing the energy and the reaction products are allowed to flow out of the engine nozzle providing the reaction mass in an ion thruster electricity is used to accelerate ions behind the spacecraft here other sources must provide the electrical energy eg a solar panel or a nuclear reactor whereas the ions provide the reaction mass6 the rate of change of velocity is called acceleration and the rate of change of momentum is called force17 to reach a given velocity one can apply a small acceleration over a long period of time or a large acceleration over a short time similarly one can achieve a given impulse with a large force over a short time or a small force over a long time this means that for maneuvering in space a propulsion method that produces tiny accelerations for a long time can often produce the same impulse as another which produces large accelerations for a short time18 however when launching from a planet tiny accelerations cannot overcome the planets gravitational pull and so cannot be used19 some designs however operate without internal reaction mass by taking advantage of magnetic fields or light pressure to change the spacecrafts momentum when discussing the efficiency of a propulsion system designers often focus on the effective use of the reaction mass which must be carried along with the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used20 spacecraft performance can be quantified in amount of change in momentum per unit of propellant consumed also called specific impulse this is a measure of the amount of impulse that can be obtained from a fixed amount of reaction mass the higher the specific impulse the better the efficiency ion propulsion engines have high specific impulse 3000 s and low thrust21 whereas chemical rockets like monopropellant or bipropellant rocket engines have a low specific impulse 300 s but high thrust22 the impulse per unit weightonearth typically designated by i sp displaystyle itextsp has units of seconds18 because the weight on earth of the reaction mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space specific impulse can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass with the same units as velocity eg meters per second23 this measure is equivalent to the effective exhaust velocity of the engine and is typically designated v e displaystyle ve 24 either the change in momentum per unit of propellant used by a spacecraft or the velocity of the propellant exiting the spacecraft can be used to measure its specific impulse the two values differ by a factor of the standard acceleration due to gravity gn 980665 ms i sp g n v e displaystyle itextspgmathrm n ve 25 in contrast to chemical rockets electrodynamic rockets use electric or magnetic fields to accelerate a charged propellant the benefit of this method is that it can achieve exhaust velocities and therefore i sp displaystyle itextsp more than 10 times greater than those of a chemical engine producing steady thrust with far less fuel with a conventional chemical propulsion system 2 of a rockets total mass might make it to the destination with the other 98 having been consumed as fuel with an electric propulsion system 70 of whats aboard in low earth orbit can make it to a deepspace destination26 however there is a tradeoff chemical rockets transform propellants into most of the energy needed to propel them but their electromagnetic equivalents must carry or produce the power required to create and accelerate propellants because there are currently practical limits on the amount of power available on a spacecraft these engines are not suitable for launch vehicles or when a spacecraft needs a quick large impulse such as when it brakes to enter a capture orbit even so because electrodynamic rockets offer very high i sp displaystyle itextsp mission planners are increasingly willing to sacrifice power and thrust and the extra time it will take to get a spacecraft where it needs to go in order to save large amounts of propellant mass25 spacecraft operate in many areas of space these include orbital maneuvering interplanetary travel and interstellar travel artificial satellites are first launched into the desired altitude by conventional liquidsolid propelled rockets after which the satellite may use onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping once in the desired orbit they often need some form of attitude control so that they are correctly pointed with respect to the earth the sun and possibly some astronomical object of interest27 they are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere so that to stay in orbit for a long period of time some form of propulsion is occasionally necessary to make small corrections orbital stationkeeping28 many satellites need to be moved from one orbit to another from time to time and this also requires propulsion29 a satellites useful life is usually over once it has exhausted its ability to adjust its orbit30 for interplanetary travel a spacecraft can use its engines to leave earths orbit it is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket gravity slingshot monopropellantbipropellent attitude control propulsion system are enough for the exploration of the solar system see new horizons once it has done so it must make its way to its destination current interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of shortterm trajectory adjustments31 in between these adjustments the spacecraft typically moves along its trajectory without accelerating the most fuelefficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a hohmann transfer orbit the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the sun a short period of thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination the spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination32 special methods such as aerobraking or aerocapture are sometimes used for this final orbital adjustment33 some spacecraft propulsion methods such as solar sails provide very low but inexhaustible thrust34 an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods would follow a rather different trajectory either constantly thrusting against its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the sun or constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance from the suncitation needed the concept has been successfully tested by the japanese ikaros solar sail spacecraft35 because interstellar distances are great a tremendous velocity is needed to get a spacecraft to its destination in a reasonable amount of time acquiring such a velocity on launch and getting rid of it on arrival remains a formidable challenge for spacecraft designers36 no spacecraft capable of short duration compared to human lifetime interstellar travel has yet been built but many hypothetical designs have been discussed spacecraft propulsion technology can be of several types such as chemical electric or nuclear they are distinguished based on the physics of the propulsion system and how thrust is generated other experimental and more theoretical types are also included depending on their technical maturity additionally there may be credible meritorious inspace propulsion concepts not foreseen or reviewed at the time of publication and which may be shown to be beneficial to future mission applications37 almost all types are reaction engines which produce thrust by expelling reaction mass in accordance with newtons third law of motion383940 examples include jet engines rocket engines pumpjet and more uncommon variations such as halleffect thrusters ion drives mass drivers and nuclear pulse propulsion41 a large fraction of rocket engines in use today are chemical rockets that is they obtain the energy needed to generate thrust by chemical reactions to create a hot gas that is expanded to produce thrust42 many different propellant combinations are used to obtain these chemical reactions including for example hydrazine liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen nitrous oxide and hydrogen peroxide43 they can be used as a monopropellant or in bipropellant configurations44 rocket engines provide essentially the highest specific powers and high specific thrusts of any engine used for spacecraft propulsion25 most rocket engines are internal combustion heat engines although noncombusting forms exist45 rocket engines generally produce a hightemperature reaction mass as a hot gas which is achieved by combusting a solid liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber46 the extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a highexpansion ratio bellshaped nozzle a feature that gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape45 the effect of the nozzle is to accelerate the mass converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy45 where exhaust speeds reaching as high as 10 times the speed of sound at sea level are commoncitation needed the dominant form of chemical propulsion for satellites has historically been hydrazine however this fuel is highly toxic and at risk of being banned across europe47 nontoxic green alternatives are now being developed to replace hydrazine nitrous oxidebased alternatives are garnering traction and government support4849 with development being led by commercial companies dawn aerospace impulse space50 and launcher51 the first nitrous oxidebased system flown in space was by dorbit onboard their ion satellite carrier space tug in 2021 using six dawn aerospace b20 thrusters launched upon a spacex falcon 9 rocket5253 rather than relying on high temperature and fluid dynamics to accelerate the reaction mass to high speeds there are a variety of methods that use electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate the reaction mass directly where the reaction mass is usually a stream of ionscitation needed ion propulsion rockets typically heat a plasma or charged gas inside a magnetic bottle and release it via a magnetic nozzle so that no solid matter needs to come in contact with the plasma54 such an engine uses electric power first to ionize atoms and then to create a voltage gradient to accelerate the ions to high exhaust velocities55 for these drives at the highest exhaust speeds energetic efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to exhaust velocitycitation needed their very high exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust but use hardly any fuelcitation needed electric propulsion is commonly used for station keeping on commercial communications satellites and for prime propulsion on some scientific space missions because of their high specific impulse56 however they generally have very small values of thrust and therefore must be operated for long durations to provide the total impulse required by a mission5575859 the idea of electric propulsion dates to 1906 when robert goddard considered the possibility in his personal notebook60 konstantin tsiolkovsky published the idea in 191161 electric propulsion methods include62 for some missions particularly reasonably close to the sun solar energy may be sufficient and has often been used but for others further out or at higher power nuclear energy is necessary engines drawing their power from a nuclear source are called nuclear electric rockets64 current nuclear power generators are approximately half the weight of solar panels per watt of energy supplied at terrestrial distances from the suncitation needed chemical power generators are not used due to the far lower total available energy65 beamed power to the spacecraft is considered to have potential according to nasa and the university of colorado boulder6667 with any current source of electrical power chemical nuclear or solar the maximum amount of power that can be generated limits the amount of thrust that can be produced to a small valuecitation needed power generation adds significant mass to the spacecraft and ultimately the weight of the power source limits the performance of the vehicle68 nuclear fuels typically have very high specific energy much higher than chemical fuels which means that they can generate large amounts of energy per unit mass this makes them valuable in spaceflight as it can enable high specific impulses sometimes even at high thrusts the machinery to do this is complex but research has developed methods for their use in propulsion systems and some have been tested in a laboratory69 here nuclear propulsion moreso refers to the source of propulsion being nuclear instead of a nuclear electric rocket where a nuclear reactor would provide power instead of solar panels for other types of electrical propulsion nuclear propulsion methods include there are several different space drives that need little or no reaction mass to function many spacecraft use reaction wheels or control moment gyroscopes to control orientation in space70 a satellite or other space vehicle is subject to the law of conservation of angular momentum which constrains a body from a net change in angular velocity thus for a vehicle to change its relative orientation without expending reaction mass another part of the vehicle may rotate in the opposite direction nonconservative external forces primarily gravitational and atmospheric can contribute up to several degrees per day to angular momentum71 so such systems are designed to bleed off undesired rotational energies built up over time the law of conservation of momentum is usually taken to imply that any engine which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship changing orientation on the other hand is possiblecitation needed but space is not empty especially space inside the solar system there are gravitation fields magnetic fields electromagnetic waves solar wind and solar radiation72 electromagnetic waves in particular are known to contain momentum despite being massless specifically the momentum flux density p of an em wave is quantitatively 1c2 times the poynting vector s ie p sc2 where c is the velocity of lightcitation needed field propulsion methods which do not rely on reaction mass thus must try to take advantage of this fact by coupling to a momentumbearing field such as an em wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft however because many of these phenomena are diffuse in nature corresponding propulsion structures must be proportionately largecitation needed the concept of solar sails rely on radiation pressure from electromagnetic energy but they require a large collection surface to function effectively73 esails propose to use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect particles which may have more controllable directionalitycitation needed magnetic sails deflect charged particles from the solar wind with a magnetic field thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft74 for instance the socalled magsail is a large superconducting loop proposed for accelerationdeceleration in the solar wind and deceleration in the interstellar medium75 a variant is the minimagnetospheric plasma propulsion system76 and its successor the magnetoplasma sail77 which inject plasma at a low rate to enhance the magnetic field to more effectively deflect charged particles in a plasma wind japan launched a solar sailpowered spacecraft ikaros in may 2010 which successfully demonstrated propulsion and guidance and is still active as of this datewhencitation needed as further proof of the solar sail concept nanosaild became the first such powered satellite to orbit earth78 as of august 2017 nasa confirmed the sunjammer solar sail project was concluded in 2014 with lessons learned for future space sail projects79 the uk cubesail programme will be the first mission to demonstrate solar sailing in low earth orbit and the first mission to demonstrate full threeaxis attitude control of a solar sail80 the concept of a gravitational slingshot is a form of propulsion to carry a space probe onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects allows the spacecraft to gain kinetic energy81 however more energy can be obtained from the gravity assist if rockets are used via the oberth effect a tether propulsion system employs a long cable with a high tensile strength to change a spacecrafts orbit such as by interaction with a planets magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object82 beampowered propulsion is another method of propulsion without reaction mass and includes sails pushed by laser microwave or particle beams83 advanced and in some cases theoretical propulsion technologies may use chemical or nonchemical physics to produce thrust but are generally considered to be of lower technical maturity with challenges that have not been overcome84 for both human and robotic exploration traversing the solar system is a struggle against time and distance the most distant planets are 456 billion kilometers from the sun and to reach them in any reasonable time requires much more capable propulsion systems than conventional chemical rockets rapid inner solar system missions with flexible launch dates are difficult requiring propulsion systems that are beyond todays current state of the art the logistics and therefore the total system mass required to support sustained human exploration beyond earth to destinations such as the moon mars or nearearth objects are daunting unless more efficient inspace propulsion technologies are developed and fielded8586 a variety of hypothetical propulsion techniques have been considered that require a deeper understanding of the properties of space particularly inertial frames and the vacuum state such methods are highly speculative and includecitation needed a nasa assessment of its breakthrough propulsion physics program divides such proposals into those that are nonviable for propulsion purposes those that are of uncertain potential and those that are not impossible according to current theories87 below is a summary of some of the more popular proven technologies followed by increasingly speculative methods four numbers are shown the first is the effective exhaust velocity the equivalent speed which the propellant leaves the vehicle this is not necessarily the most important characteristic of the propulsion method thrust and power consumption and other factors can be however the second and third are the typical amounts of thrust and the typical burn times of the method outside a gravitational potential small amounts of thrust applied over a long period will give the same effect as large amounts of thrust over a short period if the object is not significantly influenced by gravitycitation needed the fourth is the maximum deltav the technique can give without staging for rocketlike propulsion systems this is a function of mass fraction and exhaust velocity mass fraction for rocketlike systems is usually limited by propulsion system weight and tankage weightcitation needed for a system to achieve this limit the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the vehicle and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lowercitation needed table notes there have been many ideas proposed for launchassist mechanisms that have the potential of substantially reducing the cost of getting to orbit proposed nonrocket spacelaunch launchassist mechanisms include111112 studies generally show that conventional airbreathing engines such as ramjets or turbojets are basically too heavy have too low a thrustweight ratio to give significant performance improvement when installed on a launch vehiclecitation needed however launch vehicles can be air launched from separate lift vehicles eg b29 pegasus rocket and white knight which do use such propulsion systems jet engines mounted on a launch rail could also be so usedcitation needed on the other hand very lightweight or very highspeed engines have been proposed that take advantage of the air during ascent normal rocket launch vehicles fly almost vertically before rolling over at an altitude of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit this initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces airdrag airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this would permit a far flatter launch trajectory the vehicles would typically fly approximately tangentially to earths surface until leaving the atmosphere then perform a rocket burn to bridge the final deltav to orbital velocity for spacecraft already in very loworbit airbreathing electric propulsion could use residual gases in the upper atmosphere as a propellant airbreathing electric propulsion could make a new class of longlived loworbiting missions feasible on earth mars or venus114115 when a vehicle is to enter orbit around its destination planet or when it is to land it must adjust its velocity116 this can be done using any of the methods listed above provided they can generate a high enough thrust but there are methods that can take advantage of planetary atmospheres andor surfaces development of technologies will result in technical solutions that improve thrust levels specific impulse power specific mass or specific power volume system mass system complexity operational complexity commonality with other spacecraft systems manufacturability durability and cost these types of improvements will yield decreased transit times increased payload mass safer spacecraft and decreased costs in some instances the development of technologies within this technology area will result in missionenabling breakthroughs that will revolutionize space exploration there is no single propulsion technology that will benefit all missions or mission types the requirements for inspace propulsion vary widely according to their intended application54 one institution focused on developing primary propulsion technologies aimed at benefitting near and midterm science missions by reducing cost mass andor travel times is the glenn research center grccitation needed electric propulsion architectures are of particular interest to the grc including ion and hall thrusterscitation needed one system combines solar sails a form of propellantless propulsion which relies on naturally occurring starlight for propulsion energy and hall thrusters other propulsion technologies being developed include advanced chemical propulsion and aerocapture4119120 sustainable propulsion technologies such as solar cells and electric propulsion systems powered by renewable energy are gaining attention for their potential to provide solutions for space travel whilst aiming for more efficient energy sources and lesser harmful emissions however those technologies may be limited in terms of thrust and scalability121 in 2023 boeing and airbus are the leading research companies in sustainable propulsion for space applications in terms of patent family publications but mostly focus on hydrogenfuel cells and sustainable fuels the most important area in terms of patent family publications is electric propulsion the number of patent family publications in electric propulsion systems has increased from only 70 in 2000 to 293 in 2023 with the top inventors being from china121 the term mission pull defines a technology or a performance characteristic necessary to meet a planned nasa mission requirement any other relationship between a technology and a mission an alternate propulsion system for example is categorized as technology push also a space demonstration refers to the spaceflight of a scaled version of a particular technology or of a critical technology subsystem on the other hand a space validation would serve as a qualification flight for future mission implementation a successful validation flight would not require any additional space testing of a particular technology before it can be adopted for a science or exploration mission5 spacecraft propulsion systems are often first statically tested on earths surface within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to test fully122 rockets are usually tested at a rocket engine test facility well away from habitation and other buildings for safety reasons ion drives are far less dangerous and require much less stringent safety usually only a moderately large vacuum chamber is neededcitation needed static firing of engines are done at ground test facilities and systems which cannot be adequately tested on the ground and require launches may be employed at a launch site in science fiction space ships use various means to travel some of them scientifically plausible like solar sails or ramjets others mostly or entirely fictitious like antigravity warp drive spindizzy or hyperspace travel123 8 6977 124 142
