wikipediac is a free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers known as wikipedians through open collaboration and the wiki software mediawiki founded by jimmy wales and larry sanger in 2001 wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the wikimedia foundation an american nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers2 wikipedia is the largest and mostread reference work in history34 initially available only in english wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is the worlds ninth most visited website the english wikipedia with over 7 million articles remains the largest of the editions which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 15 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month about 5 edits per second on average as of april 2024updatew 1 as of may 2025update over 25 of wikipedias traffic comes from the united states while japan the united kingdom germany and russia each account for around 5needs update5 wikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge its extensive coverage unique structure and culture wikipedia has been censored by some national governments ranging from specific pages to the entire site67 wikipedias volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics but the encyclopedia has also been criticized for systemic bias such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the global south89 while the reliability of wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s it has improved over time receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward31011 articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for uptodate information about those events1213 various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of wikipedia but with limited success14 wikipedia began as a complementary project for nupedia a free online englishlanguage encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process15 it was founded on march 9 2000 under the ownership of bomis a web portal company its main figures were bomis ceo jimmy wales and larry sanger editorinchief for nupedia and later wikipedia116 nupedia was initially licensed under its own nupedia open content license but before wikipedia was founded nupedia switched to the gnu free documentation license at the urging of richard stallmanw 2 wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia17w 3 while sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goalw 4 on january 10 2001 sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupediaw 5 wikipedia was launched on january 15 2001 referred to as wikipedia day18 as a single english language edition with the domain name wwwwikipediacomw 6 and was announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list17 the name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia1920 its integral policy of neutral point of view arose within its first year21 otherwise there were initially relatively few rules and it operated independently of nupedia17 bomis originally intended for it to be a forprofit business22 wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot postings and web search engine indexing language editions were created beginning in march 2001 with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004w 7w 8 nupedia and wikipedia coexisted until the formers servers were taken down permanently in 2003 and its text was incorporated into wikipedia the english wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on september 9 2007 making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled surpassing the yongle encyclopedia made in china during the ming dynasty in 1408 which had held the record for almost 600 years23 citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control users of the spanish wikipedia forked from wikipedia to create enciclopedia libre in february 2002w 9 wales then announced that wikipedia would not display advertisements and changed wikipedias domain from wikipediacom to wikipediaorg24w 10 after an early period of exponential growth25 the growth rate of the english wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors appears to have peaked around early 200726 the edition reached 3 million articles in august 2009 around 1800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006 by 2013 that average was roughly 800w 11 a team at the palo alto research center attributed this slowing of growth to increased coordination and overhead costs exclusion of newcomers and resistance to new edits25 others suggested that the growth flattened naturally because articles that could be called lowhanging fruittopics that clearly merit an articlehad already been created and built up extensively272829 in november 2009 a researcher at the rey juan carlos university in madrid spain found that the english wikipedia had lost 49000 editors during the first three months of 2009 in comparison it lost only 4900 editors during the same period in 20083031 the wall street journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend32 wales disputed these claims in 2009 denying the decline and questioning the studys methodology33 two years later in 2011 he acknowledged a slight decline noting a decrease from a little more than 36000 writers in june 2010 to 35800 in june 2011 in the same interview he also claimed the number of editors was stable and sustainable34 a 2013 mit technology review article the decline of wikipedia questioned this claim reporting that since 2007 wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae35 in july 2012 the atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline36 in the november 25 2013 issue of new york magazine katherine ward stated wikipedia the sixthmostused website is facing an internal crisis37 the number of active english wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline3839 wikipedia has spawned several sister projects which are also wikis run by the wikimedia foundation these other wikimedia projects include wiktionary a dictionary project launched in december 2002w 12 wikiquote a collection of quotations created a week after wikimedia launched40 wikibooks a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated textsw 13 wikimedia commons a site devoted to freeknowledge multimediaw 14 wikinews for collaborative journalismw 15 and wikiversity a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activitiesw 16 another sister project of wikipedia wikispecies is a catalog of all species but is not open for public editing41 in 2012 wikivoyage an editable travel guide42 and wikidata an editable knowledge base launchedw 17 in january 2007 wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the united states according to comscore networks43 with 429 million unique visitors it was ranked ninth surpassing the new york times 10 and apple 1143 this marked a significant increase over january 2006 when wikipedia ranked 33rd with around 183 million unique visitors44 in 2014 it received 8 billion page views every monthw 18 on february 9 2014 the new york times reported that wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month according to the ratings firm comscore45 as of march 2023update it ranked sixth in popularity according to similarweb46 loveland and reagle argue that in process wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through stigmergic accumulation4748 on january 18 2012 the english wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the united states congressthe stop online piracy act sopa and the protect ip act pipaby blacking out its pages for 24 hours49 more than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content50w 19 in january 2013 274301 wikipedia an asteroid was named after wikipedia51 in october 2014 wikipedia was honored with the wikipedia monument52 and in july 2015 106 of the 7473 700page volumes of wikipedia became available as print wikipedia53 in april 2019 an israeli lunar lander beresheet crash landed on the surface of the moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the english wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates experts say the plates likely survived the crash5455 in june 2019 scientists reported that all 16 gb of article text from the english wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic dna56 on january 20 2014 subodh varma reporting for the economic times indicated that not only had wikipedias growth stalled it had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year there was a decline of about 2 billion between december 2012 and december 2013 its most popular versions are leading the slide pageviews of the english wikipedia declined by twelve percent those of german version slid by 17 percent and the japanese version lost 9 percent57 varma added while wikipedias managers think that this could be due to errors in counting other experts feel that googles knowledge graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up wikipedia users57 when contacted on this matter clay shirky associate professor at new york university and fellow at harvards berkman klein center for internet society said that he suspected much of the pageview decline was due to knowledge graphs stating if you can get your question answered from the search page you dont need to click any further57 by the end of december 2016 wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally58 as of january 2023 55791 english wikipedia articles have been cited 92300 times in scholarly journals59 from which cloud computing was the most cited page60 on january 18 2023 wikipedia debuted a new website redesign called vector 20226162 it featured a redesigned menu bar moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool62w 20 the update initially received backlash most notably when editors of the swahili wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes6163 due to wikipedias increasing popularity some editions including the english version have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases for instance on the english wikipedia and some other language editions only registered users may create a new articlew 21 on the english wikipedia among others particularly controversial sensitive or vandalismprone pages have been protected to varying degrees64 a frequently vandalized article can be semiprotected or extended confirmed protected meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors can modify it65 a particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changesw 22 a 2021 article in the columbia journalism review identified wikipedias pageprotection policies as perhaps the most important means at its disposal to regulate its market of ideas66 wikipedia has delegated some functions to bots such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active wikipedia editors67 bots must be approved by the community before their tasks are implemented68 in certain cases all editors are allowed to submit modifications but review is required for some editors depending on certain conditions for example the german wikipedia maintains stable versions of articles which have passed certain reviewsw 23 following protracted trials and community discussion the english wikipedia introduced the pending changes system in december 201269 under this system new and unregistered users edits to certain controversial or vandalismprone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published70 however restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversify the editing community71 articles related to the israelipalestinian conflict are placed under extendedconfirmed protection72 editors also can make only one revert per day across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles these restrictions were introduced in 200873 in january 2025 the arbitration committee introduced the balanced editing restriction which requires sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related to the israelipalestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been violated7475 although changes are not systematically reviewed wikipedias software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others each articles history page links to each revisione76 on most articles anyone can view the latest changes and undo others revisions by clicking a link on the articles history page registered users may maintain a watchlist of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changesw 24 new pages patrol is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problemsw 25 in 2003 economics phd student andrea ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored creative construction over creative destruction77 any change that deliberately compromises wikipedias integrity is considered vandalism the most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor it can also include advertising and other types of spam78 sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page less common types of vandalism such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information can be more difficult to detect vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting modify page semantics such as the pages title or categorization manipulate the articles underlying code or use images disruptivelyw 26 obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wikipedia articles the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes7980 however some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair81 in the seigenthaler biography incident an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of american political figure john seigenthaler in may 2005 falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of john f kennedy81 it remained uncorrected for four months81 seigenthaler the founding editorial director of usa today and founder of the freedom forum first amendment center at vanderbilt university called wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation wales said he did not although the perpetrator was eventually traced8283 after the incident seigenthaler described wikipedia as a flawed and irresponsible research tool81 the incident led to policy changes at wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people84 wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content which can be discussed on article talk pages disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article known as edit warringw 2785 it is widely seen as a resourceconsuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added86 and criticized as creating a competitive87 and conflictbased editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles8889 research has focused on for example impoliteness of disputes9091 the influence of rival editing camps9293 the conversational structure94 and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources9596 taha yasseri of the university of oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study9798 yasseri contended that simple reverts or undo operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at wikipedia he relied instead on mutually reverting edit pairs where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then in sequence returns to revert the first editor the results were tabulated for several language versions of wikipedia the english wikipedias three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles george w bush anarchism and muhammad98 by comparison for the german wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering croatia scientology and 911 conspiracy theories98 in 2020 researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors beyond mutual reverts to identify editing conflicts across wikipedia96 editors also debate the deletion of articles on wikipedia with roughly 500000 such debates since wikipedias inception once an article is nominated for deletion the dispute is typically determined by initial votes to keep or delete and by reference to topicspecific notability policies99 wikipedia is composed of 11 different namespaces with its articles being present in mainspace other namespaces have a prefix before their page title and fulfill various purposes for example the project namespace uses the wikipedia prefix and is used for selfgovernance related discussions most readers are not aware of these other namespaces100 the fundamental principles of the wikipedia community are embodied in the five pillars while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape contentw 28 the five pillars are the rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form and wikipedia editors write and revise the websites policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus101 originally rules on the nonenglish editions of wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the english wikipedia they have since diverged to some extentw 23 according to the rules on the english wikipedia community each entry in wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionarystylew 29 a topic should also meet wikipedias standards of notability which generally means that the topic has been covered extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the articles subject102 wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized and therefore must not present original research103 some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability requirements102 finally wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view this is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources using impartial language and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on their prominence information must also be verifiable104 information without citations may be tagged or removed entirely105 this can at times lead to the removal of information which though valid is not properly sourced106 as wikipedia policies changed over time and became more complex their number has grown in 2008 there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages by 2013 scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages67 wikipedias initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time107108 an article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor nor by the subject of the articlew 30 editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions some user rights are granted automatically such as the autoconfirmed and extended confirmed groups when thresholds for account age and edits are met65 experienced editors can choose to run for adminship109 which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputesw 31 administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decisionmaking instead their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have projectwide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive editsw 31 by 2012 fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to wikipedias earlier years in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous36 in 2022 there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidates antitrump views ultimately they were granted adminship110 over time wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process to determine community consensus editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums seek outside input through third opinion requests or initiate a more general community discussion known as a request for commentw 27 in which bots add the discussion to a centralized list of discussions invite editors to participate and remove the discussion from the list after 30 daysw 32 however editors have the discretion to close and delist the discussion early or late if the result of a discussion is not obvious a closeran uninvolved editor usually in good standingmay render a verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of arguers on each side111 wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as votes in which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced not112 wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts which jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field113 joseph reagle and sue gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by quakers113 62 a difference from quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement a role played by the clerk in quaker meetings113 83 the arbitration committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read the arbitration committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted114 statistical analyses suggest that the english wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted115 functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate114 therefore the committee does not dictate the content of articles although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates wikipedia policies for example if the new content is considered biasedf commonly used solutions include cautions and probations used in 63 of cases and banning editors from articles 43 subject matters 23 or wikipedia 16114 complete bans from wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behaviorw 33 when conduct is not impersonation or antisocial but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies solutions tend to be limited to warnings114 each article and each user of wikipedia has an associated and dedicated talk page these form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss coordinate and debate116 wikipedias community has been described as cultlike117 although not always with entirely negative connotations118 its preference for cohesiveness even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials has been referred to as antielitismw 34 wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification119 as wikipedia grew who writes wikipedia became one of the questions frequently asked there120 jimmy wales once argued that only a community a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers makes the bulk of contributions to wikipedia and that the project is therefore much like any traditional organization121 since wikipedia relies on volunteer labour editors frequently focus on topics that interest them122 the english wikipedia has 7051721 articles 49635343 registered editors and 109439 active editors an editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 daysw 35 editors who fail to comply with wikipedia cultural rituals such as signing talk page comments may implicitly signal that they are wikipedia outsiders increasing the odds that wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions becoming a wikipedia insider involves nontrivial costs the contributor is expected to learn wikipediaspecific technological codes submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process and learn a baffling culture rich with injokes and insider references123 editors who do not log in are in some sense secondclass citizens on wikipedia123 as participants are accredited by members of the wiki community who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product on the basis of their ongoing participation124 but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their ip addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty124 new editors often struggle to understand wikipedias complexity experienced editors are encouraged to not bite the newcomers in order to create a more welcoming atmosphere125 a 2007 study by researchers from dartmouth college found that anonymous and infrequent contributors to wikipedia are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site126 jimmy wales stated in 2009 that it turns out over 50 of all the edits are done by just 07 of the users 524 people and in fact the most active 2 which is 1400 people have done 734 of all the edits121 however business insider editor and journalist henry blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles most wikipedia content measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit is created by outsiders while most editing and formatting is done by insiders121 in 2008 a slate magazine article reported that one percent of wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the sites edits127 this method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by aaron swartz who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content measured by number of characters contributed by users with low edit counts128 a 2008 study found that wikipedians were less agreeable open and conscientious than others129 although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small130 according to a 2009 study there is evidence of growing resistance from the wikipedia community to new content131 several studies have shown that most volunteer wikipedia contributors are male notably the results of a wikimedia foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of wikipedia editors were female132 because of this universities throughout the united states tried to encourage women to become wikipedia contributors133 similarly many of these universities including yale and brown gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology133 andrew lih a professor and scientist said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ugly intimidating behavior134 data has shown that africans are underrepresented among wikipedia editors135 there are currently 343 language editions of wikipedia also called language versions or simply wikipedias as of september 2025 the six largest in order of article count are the english cebuano german french swedish and dutch wikipediasw 37 the second and fifthlargest wikipedias owe their position to the articlecreating bot lsjbot which as of 2013update had created about half the articles on the swedish wikipedia and most of the articles in the cebuano and waray wikipedias the latter are both languages of the philippines in addition to the top six twelve other wikipedias have more than a million articles each russian spanish italian polish egyptian arabic chinese japanese ukrainian vietnamese arabic waray and portuguese seven more have over 500000 articles persian catalan indonesian korean serbian norwegian and turkish 44 more have over 100000 and 82 more have over 10000w 38w 37 the largest the english wikipedia has over 7 million articles as of january 2021update the english wikipedia receives 48 of wikipedias cumulative traffic with the remaining split among the other languages the top 10 editions represent approximately 85 of the total trafficw 39 since wikipedia is based on the web and therefore worldwide contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries as is the case for the english edition these differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences eg colour versus colorw 40 or points of vieww 41 though the various language editions are held to global policies such as neutral point of view they diverge on some points of policy and practice most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair usew 42137 jimmy wales has described wikipedia as an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own languagew 43 though each language edition functions more or less independently some efforts are made to supervise them all they are coordinated in part by metawiki the wikimedia foundations wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects wikipedia and othersw 44 for instance metawiki provides important statistics on all language editions of wikipediaw 45 and it maintains a list of articles every wikipedia should havew 46 the list concerns basic content by subject biography history geography society culture science technology and mathematicsw 46 it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition for example articles about small towns in the united states might be available only in english even when they meet the notability criteria of other language wikipedia projectsw 47 translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles articles available in more than one language may offer interwiki links which link to the counterpart articles in other editions139w 48 a study published by plos one in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of wikipedia from different regions of the world it reported that the proportion of the edits made from north america was 51 for the english wikipedia and 25 for the simple english wikipedia138 on march 1 2014 the economist in an article titled the future of wikipedia cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the wikimedia foundation stating that the number of editors for the englishlanguage version has fallen by a third in seven years140 the attrition rate for active editors in english wikipedia was cited by the economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia the economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2000 editors up or down the number of active editors in english wikipedia by sharp comparison was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50000 and dropping to 30000 by the start of 2014140 in contrast the trend analysis for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42000 no comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia would provide a possible alternative to english wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the englishlanguage wikipedia140 various wikipedians have criticized wikipedias large and growing regulation which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150000 words as of 2014update141113 critics have stated that wikipedia exhibits systemic bias in 2010 columnist and journalist edwin black described wikipedia as being a mixture of truth halftruth and some falsehoods142 articles in the chronicle of higher education and the journal of academic librarianship have criticized wikipedias undueweight policy concluding that wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject give less attention to minor ones and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information143144145 journalists oliver kamm and edwin black alleged in 2010 and 2011 respectively that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices usually by a group with an ax to grind on the topic142146 a 2008 article in education next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin147 in 2020 omer benjakob and stephen harrison noted that media coverage of wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades once cast as an intellectual frivolity it is now lauded as the last bastion of shared reality online148 multiple news networks and pundits have accused wikipedia of being ideologically biased in february 2021 fox news accused wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much leftist bias149 wikipedia cofounder sanger said that wikipedia has become a propaganda for the leftleaning establishment and warned the site can no longer be trusted150 in 2022 libertarian john stossel opined that wikipedia a site he financially supported at one time appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left specifically on political topics151 some studies suggest that wikipedia and in particular the english wikipedia has a western cultural bias or prowestern bias152 or eurocentric bias153 reiterating says anna samoilenko similar biases that are found in the ivory tower of academic historiography carwil bjorkjames proposes that wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship154 and dangzhi zhao calls for a decolonization of wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated white male editors155 articles for traditional encyclopedias such as encyclopdia britannica are written by experts lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy156 however a peer review in 2005 of fortytwo scientific entries on both wikipedia and encyclopdia britannica by the science journal nature found few differences in accuracy and concluded that the average science entry in wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies britannica about three157 joseph reagle suggested that while the study reflects a topical strength of wikipedia contributors in science articles wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects158 others raised similar critiques159 the findings by nature were disputed by encyclopdia britannica160161 and in response nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by britannica162 in addition to the pointforpoint disagreement between these two parties others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the nature effort and suggested a flawed study design in natures manual selection of articles in part or in whole for comparison absence of statistical analysis eg of reported confidence intervals and a lack of study statistical power ie owing to small sample size 42 or 4 101 articles compared vs 105 and 106 set sizes for britannica and the english wikipedia respectively163 as a consequence of the open structure wikipedia makes no guarantee of validity of its content since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in itw 49 concerns have been raised by pc world in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users anonymity the insertion of false information164 vandalism and similar problems legal research in a nutshell 2011 cites wikipedia as a general source that can be a real boon in coming up to speed in the law governing a situation and while not authoritative can provide basic facts as well as leads to more indepth resources165 economist tyler cowen wrote if i had to guess whether wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think i would opt for wikipedia he comments that some traditional sources of nonfiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results in his opinion are overreported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports however he also cautions that errors are frequently found on internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them166 amy bruckman has argued that due to the number of reviewers the content of a popular wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created167 in september 2022 the sydney morning herald journalist liam mannix noted that theres no reason to expect wikipedia to be accurate and yet it is mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved wikipedia to be generally as reliable as encyclopdia britannica summarizing that turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is well a little petty168 critics argue that wikipedias open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable169 some commentators suggest that wikipedia may be reliable but that the reliability of any given article is not clear170 editors of traditional reference works such as the encyclopdia britannica have questioned the projects utility and status as an encyclopedia171 wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales has claimed that wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of fake news because the wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles172 wikipedias open structure inherently makes it an easy target for internet trolls spammers and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia76w 50 in response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues wikipedia was reported in an article in the wall street journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing174 the article stated that beginning monday from the date of the article june 16 2014 changes in wikipedias terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement katherine maher the nonprofit wikimedia foundations chief communications officer said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that were not an advertising service were an encyclopedia174175176177178 these issues among others had been parodied since the first decade of wikipedia notably by stephen colbert on the colbert report179 some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work preferring primary sources180 some specifically prohibit wikipedia citations181182 wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative183 wales once 2006 or earlier said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited wikipedia he told the students they got what they deserved for gods sake youre in college dont cite the encyclopedia he said184 in february 2007 an article in the harvard crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at harvard university were including wikipedia articles in their syllabi although without realizing the articles might change185 in june 2007 michael gorman former president of the american library association condemned wikipedia along with google stating that academics who endorse the use of wikipedia are the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of big macs with everything186 a 2020 research study published in studies in higher education argued that wikipedia could be applied in the higher education flipped classroom an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities the experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in the flipped classroom model while the control group was given direct instructions in class the conventional classroom model the groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop wikipedia entries which would be graded in quality after the study the results showed that the experimental group yielded more wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality the study concluded that learning with wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms demonstrating wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education187 on march 5 2014 julie beck writing for the atlantic magazine in an article titled doctors 1 source for healthcare information wikipedia stated that fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the wikipedia site and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information188 beck continued to detail in this article new programs of amin azzam at the university of san francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve wikipedia articles on healthrelated issues as well as internal quality control programs within wikipedia organized by james heilman to improve a group of 200 healthrelated articles of central medical importance up to wikipedias highest standard of articles using its featured article and good article peerreview evaluation process188 in a may 7 2014 followup article in the atlantic titled can wikipedia ever be a definitive medical text julie beck quotes wikiproject medicines james heilman as stating just because a reference is peerreviewed doesnt mean its a highquality reference189 beck added that wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as good or featured heilman who has participated in that process before says less than one percent of wikipedias medical articles have passed189 wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article since it has terabytes of disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopediaw 51 the exact degree and manner of coverage on wikipedia is under constant review by its editors and disagreements are not uncommon see deletionism and inclusionism190191 wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable offensive or pornographicw 52 the wikipedia is not censored policy has sometimes proved controversial in 2008 wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of muhammad in the english edition of its muhammad article citing this policy192 the presence of politically religiously and pornographically sensitive materials in wikipedia has led to the censorship of wikipedia by national authorities in china193 and pakistan194 among other countries195196197 through its wikipedia loves libraries program wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the new york public library for the performing arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles198 a 2011 study conducted by researchers at the university of minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics there was a greater concentration of females in the people and arts category while males focus more on geography and science199 an editorial in the guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers200 wikipedias policies may limit its capacity for truly representing global knowledge for example wikipedia only considers published sources to be reliable oral knowledge of indigenous cultures is not always reflected in print marginalized topics are also more likely to lack significant coverage in reliable sources wikipedias content is therefore limited as a result of larger systemic biases201 academic studies of wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the english wikipedia is an educated technically inclined white male aged 1549 from a developed predominantly christian country202 the corresponding point of view pov is overrepresented203154 this systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias gender bias and geographical bias on wikipedia204205 there are two broad types of bias which are implicit when a topic is omitted and explicit when a certain pov is overrepresented in an article or by references203 interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view204 in 2011 wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors citing for example biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare34 the october 22 2013 essay by tom simonite in mits technology review titled the decline of wikipedia discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors35 research conducted by mark graham of the oxford internet institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven with africa being the most underrepresented206 across 30 language editions of wikipedia historical articles and sections are generally eurocentric and focused on recent events207 wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content208 articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content such as feces cadaver human penis vulva and nudity contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet including childrenw 53 the site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation illustrations of zoophilia and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles it also has nonsexual photographs of nude childrenw 54 the wikipedia article about virgin killera 1976 album from the german rock band scorpionsfeatures a picture of the albums original cover which depicts a naked prepubescent girl the original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries in december 2008 access to the wikipedia article virgin killer was blocked for four days by most internet service providers in the united kingdom after the internet watch foundation iwf decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the articles url to a blacklist it supplies to british internet service providers209 in april 2010 sanger wrote a letter to the federal bureau of investigation outlining his concerns that two categories of images on wikimedia commons contained child pornography and were in violation of us federal obscenity law210211 sanger later clarified that the images which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon were not of real children but said that they constituted obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children under the protect act of 2003212 that law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under american law212 sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on wikipedia in schools213 wikimedia foundation spokesman jay walsh strongly rejected sangers accusation214 saying that wikipedia did not have material we would deem to be illegal if we did we would remove it214 following the complaint by sanger wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community after some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his cofounder status he wrote in a message to the wikimedia foundation mailinglist that this action was in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophicalcontent issues rather than be about me and how quickly i acted215 critics including wikipediocracy noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared216 one privacy concern in the case of wikipedia regards ones right to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law217g it is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life the wikimedia foundations privacy policy states we believe that you shouldnt have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement and states that personal information may be shared for legal reasons to protect you ourselves others or to understand experimentw 55 in january 2006 a german court ordered the german wikipedia shut down within germany because it stated the full name of boris floricic aka tron a deceased hacker on february 9 2006 the injunction against wikimedia deutschland was overturned with the court rejecting the notion that trons right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated218 wikipedia has a volunteer response team that uses znuny a free and opensource software fork of otrsw 56 to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties this is used for example in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the projectw 57 in late april 2023 wikimedia foundation announced that wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the uks online safety bill legislation rebecca mackinnon of the wikimedia foundation said that such checks would run counter to the websites commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers219 wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment220221 the perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in wikipedia editorship222 editathons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of womens topics223 in may 2018 a wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about donna strickland due to lack of coverage in the mediaw 58224 five months later strickland won a nobel prize in physics for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics becoming the third woman to ever receive the award224225 prior to winning the award stricklands only mention on wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and cowinner of the award grard mourou224 her exclusion from wikipedia led to accusations of sexism but corinne purtill writing for quartz argued that its also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation226 purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage226 a comprehensive 2008 survey published in 2016 by julia b bear of stony brook universitys college of business and benjamin collier of carnegie mellon university found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise discomfort with editing and response to critical feedback women reported less confidence in their expertise expressed greater discomfort with editing which typically involves conflict and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men227 wikipedia is hosted and funded by the wikimedia foundation a nonprofit organization which also operates wikipediarelated projects such as wiktionary and wikibooksw 59 the foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission228w 60 the foundations 2020 internal revenue service form 990 shows revenue of 1246 million and expenses of almost 1122 million with assets of about 1912 million and liabilities of almost 11 millionw 61 in may 2014 wikimedia foundation named lila tretikov as its second executive director taking over for sue gardnerw 62 the wall street journal reported on may 1 2014 that tretikovs information technology background from her years at university of california offers wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that information like air wants to be free229230 the same wall street journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman jay walsh of wikimedia who said tretikov would address that issue paid advocacy as a priority we are really pushing toward more transparency we are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors better mobile support of wikipedia new geolocation tools to find local content more easily and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities walsh said229 following the departure of tretikov from wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the superprotection feature which some language versions of wikipedia have adoptedw 63 katherine maher became the third executive director of the wikimedia foundation in june 2016w 64 maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to wikipedia as identified by the wikipedia board in december she said to bloomberg businessweek regarding the harassment issue that it establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority and that correction requires that it has to be more than words134 maher served as executive director until april 2021231 maryana iskander was named the incoming ceo in september 2021 and took over that role in january 2022 she stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the wikimedia community232 wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the wikimedia foundation but independentlyrun called wikimedia movement affiliates these include wikimedia chapters which are national or subnational organizations such as wikimedia deutschland and wikimedia france thematic organizations such as amical wikimedia for the catalan language community and user groups these affiliates participate in the promotion development and funding of wikipediaw 65 the operation of wikipedia depends on mediawiki a custommade free and open source wiki software platform written in php and built upon the mysql database systemw 66 the software incorporates programming features such as a macro language variables a transclusion system for templates and url redirectionw 67 mediawiki is licensed under the gnu general public license gpl and it is used by all wikimedia projects as well as many other wiki projectsw 66w 68 originally wikipedia ran on usemodwiki written in perl by clifford adams phase i which initially required camelcase for article hyperlinks the present double bracket style was incorporated laterw 69 starting in january 2002 phase ii wikipedia began running on a php wiki engine with a mysql database this software was custommade for wikipedia by magnus manske the phase ii software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand in july 2002 phase iii wikipedia shifted to the thirdgeneration software mediawiki originally written by lee daniel crocker several mediawiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the mediawiki softwarew 70 in april 2005 a lucene extensionw 71w 72 was added to mediawikis builtin search and wikipedia switched from mysql to lucene for searching lucene was later replaced by cirrussearch which is based on elasticsearchw 73 in july 2013 after extensive beta testing a wysiwyg what you see is what you get extension visualeditor was opened to public use233234235 it was met with much rejection and criticism and was described as slow and buggy236 the feature was changed from optout to optin afterwardw 74 computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical dataw 75237238 one controversial contributor sverker johansson created articles with his bot lsjbot which was reported to create up to 10000 articles on the swedish wikipedia on certain days239 additionally there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesesw 76 edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors an antivandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly237 bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or ip address ranges as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the mh17 jet in july 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via ips controlled by the russian government240 bots on wikipedia must be approved before activationw 77 according to andrew lih the current expansion of wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots241 as of 2021update page requests are first passed to a frontend layer of varnish caching servers and backend layer caching is done by apache traffic serverw 78 requests that cannot be served from the varnish cache are sent to loadbalancing servers running the linux virtual server software which in turn pass them to one of the apache web servers for page rendering from the databasew 78 the web servers deliver pages as requested performing page rendering for all the language editions of wikipedia to increase speed further rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses242 wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of linux servers running the debian operating systemw 79 by january 22 2013 wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an equinix facility in ashburn virginiaw 80243 in 2017 wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an equinix facility in singapore the first of its kind in asiaw 81 in 2022 a caching data center was opened in marseille francew 82 in 2024 a caching data center was opened in so paulo the first of its kind in south americaw 83 as of november 2024update caching clusters are located in amsterdam san francisco singapore marseille and so paulow 84w 85 following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits35 the foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the reinvestment of donations into the internal research and development of the foundation244 two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a visual editor and the thank tab in the edit history which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition35236 the estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by adam jaffe who recorded that the range of 4 to 25 annually was to be recommended with highend technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment245 at the 2013 level of contributions for wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollarsw 86 the computed budget level recommended by jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 18 million and 113 million dollars annually245 in 2019 the level of contributions were reported by the wikimedia foundation as being at 120 million annuallyw 87 updating the jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between 308 million and 192 million annually245 multiple wikimedia projects have internal news publications wikimedias online newspaper the signpost was founded in 2005 by michael snow a wikipedia administrator who would join the wikimedia foundations board of trustees in 2008246247 the publication covers news and events from the english wikipedia the wikimedia foundation and wikipedias sister projectsw 88 wikipedia editors sometimes struggle to access paywalled sources needed to improve a subject248 the wikipedia library is a resource for wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia249250 over 60 publishers have partnered with the wikipedia library to provide access to their resources when ice publishing joined in 2020 a spokesman said by enabling free access to our content for wikipedia editors we hope to further the research communitys resources creating and updating wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers251 when the project was started in 2001 all text in wikipedia was covered by the gnu free documentation license gfdl a copyleft license permitting the redistribution creation of derivative works and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their workw 89 the gfdl was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the gpl this made it a poor choice for a general reference work for example the gfdl requires the reprints of materials from wikipedia to come with a full copy of the gfdl text252 in december 2002 the creative commons license was released it was specifically designed for creative works in general not just for software manuals the wikipedia project sought the switch to the creative commonsw 90 because the gfdl and creative commons were incompatible in november 2008 following the request of the project the free software foundation fsf released a new version of the gfdl designed specifically to allow wikipedia to relicense its content to cc bysa by august 1 2009w 91 in april 2009 wikipedia and its sister projects held a communitywide referendum which decided the switch in june 2009w 92w 93w 94w 95 the handling of media files eg image files varies across language editions some language editions such as the english wikipedia include nonfree image files under fair use doctrinew 96 while the others have opted not to in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries eg in japanese copyright law media files covered by free content licenses eg creative commons cc bysa are shared across language editions via wikimedia commons repository a project operated by the wikimedia foundationw 97 wikipedias accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text253 the wikimedia foundation is not a licensor of content on wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of wikipedia a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in france254255 because wikipedia content is distributed under an open license anyone can reuse or redistribute it at no chargew 98 the content of wikipedia has been published in many forms both online and offline outside the wikipedia website thousands of mirror sites exist that republish content from wikipedia two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are referencecom and answerscom256257 another example is wapedia which began to display wikipedia content in a mobiledevicefriendly format before wikipedia itself didw 99 some web search engines make special use of wikipedia content when displaying search results examples include microsoft bing via technology gained from powerset258 and duckduckgo collections of wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs an english version released in 2006 contained about 2000 articlesw 100 the polishlanguage version from 2006 contains nearly 240000 articlesw 101 the germanlanguage version from 20072008 contains over 620000 articlesw 102 and the spanishlanguage version from 2011 contains 886000 articlesw 103 additionally wikipedia for schools the wikipedia series of cds dvds produced by wikipedia and sos children is a free selection from wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeenw 104 there have been efforts to put a select subset of wikipedias articles into printed book form259w 105 since 2009 tens of thousands of printondemand books that reproduced english german russian and french wikipedia articles have been produced by the american company books llc and by three mauritian subsidiaries of the german publisher vdm260 the website dbpedia begun in 2007 extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the englishlanguage wikipedia261 wikimedia has created the wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of wikipedia and other wikimedia foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format rdfw 106 as of february 2023update it has over 101 million itemsw 107 wikireader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of wikipedia which was launched by openmoko and first released in 2009w 108 obtaining the full contents of wikipedia for reuse presents challenges since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouragedw 109 wikipedia publishes dumps of its contents but these are textonly as of 2023update there is no dump available of wikipedias imagesw 110 wikimedia enterprise is a forprofit solution to this262 several languages of wikipedia also maintain a reference desk where volunteers answer questions from the general public according to a study by pnina shachaf in the journal of documentation the quality of the wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk with an accuracy of 55 percent263 wikipedias original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed internet connection although wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since july 2013 the new york times on february 9 2014 quoted erik mller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry the article in the new york times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that only 20 percent of the readership of the englishlanguage wikipedia comes via mobile devices a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites many of which approach 50 percent and the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more in 2014 the new york times reported that mller has assigned a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the wikimedia foundation one principal concern cited by the new york times for the worry is for wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment45 by 2023 the wikimedia foundations staff had grown to over 700 employees2 access to wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004 through the wireless application protocol wap via the wapedia servicew 99 in june 2007 wikipedia launched enmobilewikipediaorg an official website for wireless devices in 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released located at enmwikipediaorg which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iphone androidbased devices or webosbased devicesw 111 several other methods of mobile access to wikipedia have emerged since many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of wikipedia content for mobile devices while some also incorporate additional features such as use of wikipedia metadata like geoinformation264265 the android app for wikipedia was released in january 2012 to over 500000 installs and generally positive reviews scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200000 users downloading from googlew 112w 113 the version for ios was released on april 3 2013 to similar reviewsw 114 wikipedia zero was an initiative of the wikimedia foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free accessw 115266 it was discontinued in february 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operatorsw 115 andrew lih and andrew brown both maintain editing wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors267268 lih states that the number of wikipedia editors has been declining after several years267 and tom simonite of mit technology review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this simonite alleges some wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo35 lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this lih fears for wikipedias longterm future while brown fears problems with wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it267268 access to wikipedia has been blocked in mainland china since may 20157269270 this was done after wikipedia started to use https encryption which made selective censorship more difficult271 in 201718 after a barrage of false news reports both facebook and youtube announced they would rely on wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news272273 noam cohen writing in the washington post states youtubes reliance on wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another factchallenged platform the facebook social network which announced last year that wikipedia would help its users root out fake news273274 in february 2014 the new york times reported that wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites stating with 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month wikipedia trails just yahoo facebook microsoft and google the largest with 12 billion unique visitors45 however its ranking dropped to 13th globally by june 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of chinese websites for online shopping58 the website has since recovered its ranking as of april 202258 in addition to logistic growth in the number of its articlesw 116 wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001275 the number of readers of wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009w 117 the pew internet and american life project found that one third of us internet users consulted wikipedia276 in 2011 business insider gave wikipedia a valuation of 4 billion if it ran advertisements277 according to wikipedia readership survey 2011 the average age of wikipedia readers is 36 with a rough parity between genders almost half of wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month and a similar number of readers specifically look for wikipedia in search engine results about 47 percent of wikipedia readers do not realize that wikipedia is a nonprofit organizationw 118 as of february 2023update wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly with the english wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each monthw 1 during the covid19 pandemic wikipedias coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention and brought an increase in wikipedia readership overall278279280281 noam cohen wrote in wired that wikipedias effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites opining unless twitter facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively wikipedia will remain the last best place on the internet279 in october 2020 the world health organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on wikimedia projects282 there were nearly 7000 covid19 related wikipedia articles across 188

wikipedias article on samesex marriage in the related links section of its further reading list for the civil marriage act287 the encyclopedias assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the us federal courts and the world intellectual property organization288though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case289 content appearing on wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some us intelligence agency reports290 in december 2008 the scientific journal rna biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of rna molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the rna family for publication in wikipedia291 wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism292293 often without attribution and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from wikipedia294295296297 in 2006 time magazine recognized wikipedias participation along with youtube reddit myspace and facebook in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide298 on september 16 2007 the washington post reported that wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 us election campaign saying type a candidates name into google and among the first results is a wikipedia page making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate already the presidential entries are being edited dissected and debated countless times each day299 an october 2007 reuters article titled wikipedia page the latest status symbol reported the recent phenomenon of how having a wikipedia article vindicates ones notability300 one of the first times wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on september 28 2007 when italian politician franco grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama he said that the lack of such freedom forced wikipedia the seventh most consulted website to forbid all images of modern italian buildings and art and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues301 a working group led by peter stone formed as a part of the stanfordbased project one hundred year study on artificial intelligence in its report called wikipedia the bestknown example of crowdsourcing that far exceeds traditionallycompiled information sources such as encyclopedias and dictionaries in scale and depth302303 in a 2017 opinion piece for wired hossein derakhshan describes wikipedia as one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web and contrasted its existence as a textbased source of knowledge with social media and social networking services the latter having since colonized the web for televisions values for derakhshan wikipedias goal as an encyclopedia represents the age of enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions a trend which he considers endangered due to the gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one which in turn means a shift from rationality to emotions exposition to entertainment rather than sapere aude lit dare to know social networks have led to a culture of dare not to care to know this is while wikipedia faces a more concerning problem than funding namely a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website consequently the challenge for wikipedia and those who use it is to save wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old televisionhow to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know304 wikipedia has won many awards receiving its first two major awards in may 2004w 120 the first was a golden nica for digital communities of the annual prix ars electronica contest this came with a 10000 6588 12700 grant and an invitation to present at the pae cyberarts festival in austria later that year the
