the international space station iss is a large space station that was assembled and is maintained in low earth orbit by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors nasa united states roscosmos russia esa europe jaxa japan and csa canada as the largest space station ever constructed it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments in microgravity and studying the space environment11 the station is divided into two main sections the russian orbital segment ros developed by roscosmos and the us orbital segment usos built by nasa esa jaxa and csa a striking feature of the iss is the integrated truss structure which connect the stations vast system of solar panels and radiators to its pressurized modules these modules support diverse functions including scientific research crew habitation storage spacecraft control and airlock operations the iss has eight docking and berthing ports for visiting spacecraft the station orbits the earth at an average altitude of 400 kilometres 250 miles12 and circles the earth in roughly 93 minutes completing 155 orbits per day13 the iss programme combines two previously planned crewed earthorbiting stations the united states space station freedom and the soviet unions mir2 the first iss module was launched in 1998 with major components delivered by proton and soyuz rockets and the space shuttle longterm occupancy began on 2 november 2000 with the arrival of the expedition 1 crew since then the iss has remained continuously inhabited for 24 years and 307 days the longest continuous human presence in space as of august 2025update 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the station14 future plans for the iss include the addition of at least one module axiom spaces payload power thermal module the station is expected to remain operational until the end of 2030 after which it will be deorbited using a dedicated nasa spacecraft15 as the space race drew to a close in the early 1970s the us and ussr began to contemplate a variety of potential collaborations in outer space this culminated in the 1975 apollosoyuz test project the first docking of spacecraft from two different spacefaring nations the astp was considered a success and further joint missions were also contemplated one such concept was international skylab which proposed launching the backup skylab b space station for a mission that would see multiple visits by both apollo and soyuz crew vehicles16 more ambitious was the skylabsalyut space laboratory which proposed docking the skylab b to a soviet salyut space station falling budgets and rising cold war tensions in the late 1970s saw these concepts fall by the wayside along with another plan to have the space shuttle dock with a salyut space station17 in the early 1980s nasa planned to launch a modular space station called freedom as a counterpart to the salyut and mir space stations in 1984 the esa was invited to participate in space station freedom and the esa approved the columbus laboratory by 198718 the japanese experiment module jem or kib was announced in 1985 as part of the freedom space station in response to a nasa request in 1982 in early 1985 science ministers from the european space agency esa countries approved the columbus programme the most ambitious effort in space undertaken by that organization at the time the plan spearheaded by germany and italy included a module which would be attached to freedom and with the capability to evolve into a fullfledged european orbital outpost before the end of the century19 increasing costs threw these plans into doubt in the early 1990s congress was unwilling to provide enough money to build and operate freedom and demanded nasa increase international participation to defray the rising costs or they would cancel the entire project outright20 simultaneously the ussr was conducting planning for the mir2 space station and had begun constructing modules for the new station by the mid1980s however the collapse of the soviet union required these plans to be greatly downscaled and soon mir2 was in danger of never being launched at all21 with both space station projects in jeopardy american and russian officials met and proposed they be combined 22 the iss was originally intended to be a laboratory observatory and factory while providing transportation maintenance and a low earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the moon mars and asteroids however not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between nasa and roscosmos have been realised25 in the 2010 united states national space policy the iss was given additional roles of serving commercial diplomatic26 and educational purposes27 the iss provides a platform to conduct scientific research with power data cooling and crew available to support experiments small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space but space stations offer a longterm environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades combined with ready access by human researchers2829 the iss simplifies individual experiments by allowing groups of experiments to share the same launches and crew time research is conducted in a wide variety of fields including astrobiology astronomy physical sciences materials science space weather meteorology and human research including space medicine and the life sciences30313233 scientists on earth have timely access to the data and can suggest experimental modifications to the crew if followon experiments are necessary the routinely scheduled launches of resupply craft allows new hardware to be launched with relative ease29 crews fly expeditions of several months duration providing approximately 160 manhours per week of labour with a crew of six however a considerable amount of crew time is taken up by station maintenance34 perhaps the most notable iss experiment is the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams which is intended to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe according to nasa the ams is as important as the hubble space telescope currently docked on station it could not have been easily accommodated on a free flying satellite platform because of its power and bandwidth needs3536 on 3 april 2013 scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the ams373839404142 according to the scientists the first results from the spaceborne alpha magnetic spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of highenergy positrons in earthbound cosmic rays43 the space environment is hostile to life unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind in addition to cosmic rays high vacuum extreme temperatures and microgravity44 some simple forms of life called extremophiles45 as well as small invertebrates called tardigrades46 can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state through desiccation medical research improves knowledge about the effects of longterm space exposure on the human body including muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift these data will be used to determine whether high duration human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible in 2006 data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggested that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the sixmonth interval required to travel to mars4748 medical studies are conducted aboard the iss on behalf of the national space biomedical research institute nsbri prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts the study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space usually there is no physician on board the iss and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge it is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult495051 in august 2020 scientists reported that bacteria from earth particularly deinococcus radiodurans bacteria which is highly resistant to environmental hazards were found to survive for three years in outer space based on studies conducted on the international space station these findings supported the notion of panspermia the hypothesis that life exists throughout the universe distributed in various ways including space dust meteoroids asteroids comets planetoids or contaminated spacecraft5253 remote sensing of the earth astronomy and deep space research on the iss have significantly increased during the 2010s after the completion of the us orbital segment in 2011 throughout the more than 20 years of the iss program researchers aboard the iss and on the ground have examined aerosols ozone lightning and oxides in earths atmosphere as well as the sun cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe examples of earthviewing remote sensing experiments that have flown on the iss are the orbiting carbon observatory 3 issrapidscat ecostress the global ecosystem dynamics investigation and the cloud aerosol transport system issbased astronomy telescopes and experiments include solar the neutron star interior composition explorer the calorimetric electron telescope the monitor of allsky xray image maxi and the alpha magnetic spectrometer3054 researchers are investigating the effect of the stations nearweightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals in response to some of the data nasa wants to investigate microgravitys effects on the growth of threedimensional humanlike tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space30 investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on earth examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity30 the study of materials science is an important iss research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on earth55 other areas of interest include the effect of low gravity on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants these findings may improve knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits30 the iss provides a location in the relative safety of low earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for longduration missions to the moon and mars this provides experience in operations maintenance and repair and replacement activities onorbit this will help develop essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from earth reduce mission risks and advance the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft56 referring to the mars500 experiment a crew isolation experiment conducted on earth esa states whereas the iss is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness radiation and other spacespecific factors aspects such as the effect of longterm isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via groundbased simulations57 sergey krasnov the head of human space flight programmes for russias space agency roscosmos in 2011 suggested a shorter version of mars500 may be carried out on the iss58 in 2009 noting the value of the partnership framework itself sergey krasnov wrote when compared with partners acting separately partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration the iss is helping further advance nearearth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the solar system including the moon and mars59 a crewed mission to mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current iss partnership in 2010 esa directorgeneral jeanjacques dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that china india and south korea be invited to join the iss partnership60 nasa chief charles bolden stated in february 2011 any mission to mars is likely to be a global effort61 currently us federal legislation prevents nasa cooperation with china on space projects without approval by the fbi and congress62 the iss crew provides opportunities for students on earth by running studentdeveloped experiments making educational demonstrations allowing for student participation in classroom versions of iss experiments and directly engaging students using radio and email6364 esa offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms65 in one lesson students can navigate a 3d model of the interior and exterior of the iss and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time66 the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa aims to inspire children to pursue craftsmanship and to heighten their awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society67 through a series of education guides students develop a deeper understanding of the past and nearterm future of crewed space flight as well as that of earth and life6869 in the jaxa seeds in space experiments the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the iss are explored by growing sunflower seeds that have flown on the iss for about nine months in the first phase of kib utilisation from 2008 to mid2010 researchers from more than a dozen japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields70 cultural activities are another major objective of the iss programme tetsuo tanaka the director of jaxas space environment and utilization center has said there is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science71 amateur radio on the iss ariss is a volunteer programme that encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science technology engineering and mathematics through amateur radio communications opportunities with the iss crew ariss is an international working group consisting of delegations from nine countries including several in europe as well as japan russia canada and the united states in areas where radio equipment cannot be used speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the space station72 first orbit is a 2011 featurelength documentary film about vostok 1 the first crewed space flight around the earth by matching the orbit of the iss to that of vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground path and time of day documentary filmmaker christopher riley and esa astronaut paolo nespoli were able to film the view that yuri gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight this new footage was cut together with the original vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the russian state archive nespoli is credited as the director of photography for this documentary film as he recorded the majority of the footage himself during expedition 262773 the film was streamed in a global youtube premiere in 2011 under a free licence through the website firstorbitorg74 in may 2013 commander chris hadfield shot a music video of david bowies space oddity on board the station which was released on youtube7576 it was the first music video filmed in space77 in november 2017 while participating in expedition 5253 on the iss paolo nespoli made two recordings of his spoken voice one in english and the other in his native italian for use on wikipedia articles these were the first content made in space specifically for wikipedia7879 in november 2021 a virtual reality exhibit called the infinite featuring life aboard the iss was announced80 involving five space programs and fifteen countries81 the international space station is the most politically and legally complex space exploration programme in history81 the 1998 space station intergovernmental agreement sets forth the primary framework for international cooperation among the parties a series of subsequent agreements govern other aspects of the station ranging from jurisdictional issues to a code of conduct among visiting astronauts82 brazil was also invited to participate in the programme the only developing country to receive such an invitation under the agreement framework brazil was to provide six pieces of hardware and in exchange would receive iss utilization rights however brazil was unable to deliver any of the elements due to a lack of funding and political priority within the country brazil officially dropped out of the iss programme in 20078384 following the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine continued cooperation between russia and other countries on the international space station has been put into question roscosmos director general dmitry rogozin insinuated that russian withdrawal could cause the international space station to deorbit due to lack of reboost capabilities writing in a series of tweets if you block cooperation with us who will save the iss from an unguided deorbit to impact on the territory of the us or europe theres also the chance of impact of the 500ton construction in india or china do you want to threaten them with such a prospect the iss doesnt fly over russia so all the risk is yours are you ready for it85 this latter claim is untrue the iss flies over all parts of the earth between 516 degrees latitude north and south approximately the latitude of saratov rogozin later tweeted that normal relations between iss partners could only be restored once sanctions have been lifted and indicated that roscosmos would submit proposals to the russian government on ending cooperation86 nasa stated that if necessary us corporation northrop grumman has offered a reboost capability that would keep the iss in orbit87 on 26 july 2022 yury borisov rogozins successor as head of roscosmos submitted to russian president putin plans for withdrawal from the programme after 202488 however robyn gatens the nasa official in charge of the space station responded that nasa had not received any formal notices from roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans89 the international space station is a product of global collaboration with its components manufactured across the world the modules of the russian orbital segment including zarya and zvezda were produced at the khrunichev state research and production space center in moscow zvezda was initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for the mir2 space station which was never launched9091 much of the us orbital segment including the destiny and unity modules the integrated truss structure and solar arrays were built at nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama and michoud assembly facility in new orleans90 these components underwent final assembly and processing for launch at the operations and checkout building and the space station processing facility sspf at the kennedy space center in florida92 the us orbital segment also hosts the columbus module contributed by the european space agency and built in germany the kib module contributed by japan and built at the tsukuba space center and the institute of space and astronautical science along with the canadarm2 and dextre a joint canadianus endeavor all of these components were shipped to the sspf for launch processing9093 the assembly of the international space station a major endeavour in space architecture began in november 19988 modules in the russian segment launched and docked autonomously with the exception of rassvet other modules and components were delivered by the space shuttle which then had to be installed by astronauts either remotely using robotic arms or during spacewalks more formally known as extravehicular activities evas by 5 june 2011 astronauts had made over 159 evas to add components to the station totaling more than 1000 hours in space9495 the beginning of the core of the isss tenure in orbit was the launch of the russianbuilt zarya module atop a proton rocket on 20 november 1998 zarya provided propulsion attitude control communications and electrical power two weeks later on 4 december 1998 the americanmade unity was ferried aboard space shuttle endeavour on sts88 and joined with zarya unity provided the connection between the russian and us segments of the station and would provide ports to connect future modules and visiting spacecraft while the connection of two modules built on different continents by nations that were once bitter rivals was a significant milestone these two initial modules lacked lifesupport systems and the iss remained unmanned for the next two years at the time the russian station mir was still inhabited the turning point arrived in july 2000 with the launch of the zvezda module equipped with living quarters and lifesupport systems zvezda enabled continuous human presence aboard the station the first crew expedition 1 arrived that november aboard soyuz tm319697 the iss grew steadily over the following years with modules delivered by both russian rockets and the space shuttle expedition 1 arrived midway between the space shuttle flights of missions sts92 and sts97 these two flights each added segments of the stations integrated truss structure which provided the station with ku band communications additional attitude control needed for the additional mass of the usos and additional solar arrays98 over the next two years the station continued to expand a soyuzu rocket delivered the pirs docking compartment the space shuttles discovery atlantis and endeavour delivered the american destiny laboratory and quest airlock in addition to the stations main robot arm the canadarm2 and several more segments of the integrated truss structure tragedy struck in 2003 with the loss of the space shuttle columbia which grounded the rest of the shuttle fleet halting construction of the iss assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of sts115 with atlantis which delivered the stations second set of solar arrays several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on sts116 sts117 and sts118 as a result of the major expansion of the stations powergenerating capabilities more modules could be accommodated and the us harmony module and columbus european laboratory were added these were soon followed by the first two components of the japanese kib laboratory in march 2009 sts119 completed the integrated truss structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays the final section of kib was delivered in july 2009 on sts127 followed by the russian poisk module the us tranquility module was delivered in february 2010 during sts130 alongside the cupola followed by the penultimate russian module rassvet in may 2010 rassvet was delivered by space shuttle atlantis on sts132 in exchange for the russian proton delivery of the usfunded zarya module in 199899 the last pressurised module of the usos leonardo was brought to the station in february 2011 on the final flight of discovery sts133100 russias new primary research module nauka docked in july 2021101 along with the european robotic arm which can relocate itself to different parts of the russian modules of the station102 russias latest addition the prichal module docked in november 2021103 as of june 2025 nasagov states that there are 43 different modules and elements installed on the iss104 the iss functions as a modular space station enabling the addition or removal of modules from its structure for increased adaptability below is a diagram of major station components the unity node joins directly to the destiny laboratory for clarity they are shown apart similar cases are also seen in other parts of the structure key to box background colors zarya russian lit sunrisec also known as the functional cargo block russian was the inaugural component of the iss launched in 1998 it initially served as the isss power source storage propulsion and guidance system as the station has grown zaryas role has transitioned primarily to storage both internally and in its external fuel tanks106 a descendant of the tks spacecraft used in the salyut programme zarya was built in russia but is owned by the united states its name symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation107 unity also known as node 1 is the inaugural usbuilt component of the iss108109 serving as the connection between the russian and us segments this cylindrical module features six common berthing mechanism locations forward aft port starboard zenith and nadir for attaching additional modules measuring 457 metres 150 ft in diameter and 547 metres 179 ft in length unity was constructed of steel by boeing for nasa at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama it was the first of three connecting nodes unity harmony and tranquility that forms the structural backbone of the us segment of the iss110 zvezda russian lit star launched in july 2000 is the core of the russian orbital segment of the iss initially providing essential living quarters and lifesupport systems it enabled the first continuous human presence aboard the station while additional modules have expanded the isss capabilities zvezda remains the command and control center for the russian segment and it is where crews gather during emergencies111112113 a descendant of the salyut programmes dos spacecraft zvezda was built by rkk energia and launched atop a proton rocket114 the destiny laboratory is the primary research facility for us experiments on the iss nasas first permanent orbital research station since skylab the module was built by boeing and launched aboard space shuttle atlantis during sts98 attached to unity over a period of five days in february 2001 destiny has been a hub for scientific research ever since115116117 within destiny astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as medicine engineering biotechnology physics materials science and earth science researchers worldwide benefit from these studies the module also houses lifesupport systems including the oxygen generating system118 the quest joint airlock enables extravehicular activities evas using either the us extravehicular mobility unit emu or the russian orlan space suit119 before its installation conducting evas from the iss was challenging due to a variety of system and design differences only the orlan suit could be used from the transfer chamber on the zvezda module which was not a purposebuilt airlock and the emu could only be used from the airlock on a visiting space shuttle which could not accommodate the orlan120 launched aboard space shuttle atlantis during sts104 in july 2001 and attached to the unity module quest is a 61metrelong 20 ft 40metrewide 13 ft structure built by boeing121 it houses the crew airlock for astronaut egress an equipment airlock for suit storage and has facilities to accommodate astronauts during their overnight prebreathe procedures to prevent decompression sickness120 the crew airlock derived from the space shuttle features essential equipment like lighting handrails and an umbilical interface assembly uia that provides lifesupport and communication systems for up to two spacesuits simultaneously these can be either two emus two orlan suits or one of each design poisk russian lit search also known as the miniresearch module 2 russian 2 serves as both a secondary airlock on the russian segment of the iss and supports docking for soyuz and progress spacecraft facilitates propellant transfers from the latter122 launched on 10 november 2009 attached to a modified progress spacecraft called progress mmim2123124 poisk provides facilities to maintain orlan spacesuits and is equipped with two inwardopening hatches a design change from mir which encountered a dangerous situation caused by an outwardopening hatch that opened too quickly because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock125 since the departure of pirs in 2021 its become the sole airlock on the russian segment harmony or node 2 is the central connecting hub of the us segment of the iss linking the us european and japanese laboratory modules its also been called the utility hub of the iss as it provides essential power data and lifesupport systems the module also houses sleeping quarters for four crew members126 launched on 23 october 2007 aboard space shuttle discovery on sts120127128 harmony was initially attached to the unity129130 before being relocated to its permanent position at the front of the destiny laboratory on 14 november 2007131 this expansion added significant living space to the iss marking a key milestone in the construction of the us segment tranquility also known as node 3 is a module of the iss it contains environmental control systems lifesupport systems a toilet exercise equipment and an observation cupola the european space agency and the italian space agency had tranquility manufactured by thales alenia space a ceremony on 20 november 2009 transferred ownership of the module to nasa132 on 8 february 2010 nasa launched the module on the space shuttles sts130 mission columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the iss and is the largest single contribution to the station made by the european space agency like the harmony and tranquility modules the columbus laboratory was constructed in turin italy by thales alenia space the functional equipment and software of the

module 1 russian 1 and formerly known as the docking cargo module is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft on the russian segment of the iss rassvet replaced the cancelled docking and storage module and used a design largely based on the mir docking module built in 1995 rassvet was delivered in on 14 may 2010 space shuttle atlantis on sts132 in exchange for the russian proton delivery of the usfunded zarya module in 1998136 rassvet was attached to zarya shortly thereafter137 the leonardo permanent multipurpose module pmm was flown into space aboard the space shuttle discovery on sts133 on 24 february 2011 and installed on 1 march leonardo is primarily used for storage of spares supplies and waste on the iss which was until then stored in many different places within the space station it is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in the us orbital segment the leonardo pmm was a multipurpose logistics module mplm before 2011 but was modified into its current configuration it was formerly one of two mplm used for bringing cargo to and from the iss with the space shuttle the module was named for italian polymath leonardo da vinci the bigelow expandable activity module beam is an experimental expandable space station module developed by bigelow aerospace under contract to nasa for testing as a temporary module on the international space station iss from 2016 to at least 2020 it arrived at the iss on 10 april 2016138 was berthed to the station on 16 april at tranquility node 3 and was expanded and pressurized on 28 may 2016 in december 2021 bigelow aerospace conveyed ownership of the module to nasa as a result of bigelows cessation of activity139 the international docking adapter ida is a spacecraft docking system adapter developed to convert apas95 to the nasa docking system nds an ida is placed on each of the isss two open pressurized mating adapters pmas both of which are connected to the harmony module two international docking adapters are currently installed aboard the station originally ida1 was planned to be installed on pma2 located at harmonys forward port and ida2 would be installed on pma3 at harmonys zenith after ida 1 was destroyed in a launch incident ida2 was installed on pma2 on 19 august 2016140 while ida3 was later installed on pma3 on 21 august 2019141 the nanoracks bishop airlock module is a commercially funded airlock module launched to the iss on spacex crs21 on 6 december 2020142143 the module was built by nanoracks thales alenia space and boeing144

multipurpose laboratory module upgrade russian is a roscosmosfunded component of the iss that was launched on 21 july 2021 1458 utc in the original iss plans nauka was to use the location of the docking and stowage module dsm but the dsm was later replaced by the rassvet module and moved to zaryas nadir port nauka was successfully docked to zvezdas nadir port on 29 july 2021 1329 utc replacing the pirs module it had a temporary docking adapter on its nadir port for crewed and uncrewed missions until prichal arrival where just before its arrival it was removed by a departing progress spacecraft146 prichal russian lit pier is a 4tonne 8800 lb spherical module that serves as a docking hub for the russian segment of the iss launched in november 2021 prichal provides additional docking ports for soyuz and progress spacecraft as well as potential future modules prichal features six docking ports forward aft port starboard zenith and nadir one of these ports equipped with an active hybrid docking system enabled it to dock with the nauka module the remaining five ports are passive hybrids allowing for docking of soyuz progress and heavier modules as well as future spacecraft with modified docking systems as of 2024 the forward aft port and starboard docking ports remain covered prichal was initially intended to be an element of the now canceled orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex147148149150 the iss has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation the largest of these is the integrated truss structure its to which the stations main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted151 the its consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 1085 metres 356 ft long8 the station was intended to have several smaller external components such as six robotic arms three external stowage platforms esps and four express logistics carriers elcs152153 while these platforms allow experiments including misse the stph3 and the robotic refueling mission to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally their primary function is to store spare orbital replacement units orus orus are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life including pumps storage tanks antennas and battery units such units are replaced either by astronauts during eva or by robotic arms154 several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of orus including sts129155 sts133156 and sts134157 as of january 2011update only one other mode of transportation of orus had been used the japanese cargo vessel htv2 which delivered an fhrc and ctc2 via its exposed pallet ep158needs update there are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules the kib exposed facility serves as an external porch for the kib complex159 and a facility on the european columbus laboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as the european technology exposure facility160161 and the atomic clock ensemble in space162 a remote sensing instrument sage iiiiss was delivered to the station in february 2017 aboard crs10163 and the nicer experiment was delivered aboard crs11 in june 2017164 the largest scientific payload externally mounted to the iss is the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams a particle physics experiment launched on sts134 in may 2011 and mounted externally on the its the ams measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter165166 the commercial

is named after christopher columbuss younger brother167168169 in may 2010 equipment for nauka was launched on sts132 as part of an agreement with nasa and delivered by space shuttle atlantis weighing 14 metric tons the equipment was attached to the outside of rassvet mrm1 it included a spare elbow joint for the european robotic arm era which was launched with nauka and an eraportable workpost used during evas as well as rtod addon heat radiator and internal hardware alongside the pressurized experiment airlock170 the rtod radiator adds additional cooling capability to nauka which enables the module to host more scientific experiments170 the era was used to remove the rtod radiator from rassvet and transferred over to nauka during vkd56 spacewalk later it was activated and fully deployed on vkd58 spacewalk171 this process took several months a portable work platform was also transferred over in august 2023 during vkd60 spacewalk which can attach to the end of the era to allow cosmonauts to ride on the end of the arm during spacewalks172173 however even after several months of outfitting evas and rtod heat radiator installation six months later the rtod radiator malfunctioned before active use of nauka the purpose of rtod installation is to radiate heat from nauka experiments the malfunction a leak rendered the rtod radiator unusable for nauka this is the third iss radiator leak after soyuz ms22 and progress ms21 radiator leaks if a spare rtod is not available nauka experiments will have to rely on naukas main launch radiator and the module could never be used to its full capacity174175 another mlm outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads sredstva krepleniya krupnogabaritnykh obyektov skko176 delivered in two parts to nauka by progress ms18 lccs part and progress ms21 scccs part as part of the module activation outfitting process177178179180 it was taken outside and installed on the era aft facing base point on nauka during the vkd55 spacewalk181182183184 the integrated truss structure its serves as a base for the stations primary remote manipulator system the mobile servicing system mss which is composed of three main components a grapple fixture was added to zarya on sts134 to enable canadarm2 to inchworm itself onto the ros157 also installed during sts134 was the 15 m 50 ft orbiter boom sensor system obss which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on space shuttle missions and which can be used on the station to increase the reach of the mss157 staff on earth or the iss can operate the mss components using remote control performing work outside the station without the need for space walks japans remote manipulator system which services the kib exposed facility188 was launched on sts124 and is attached to the kib pressurised module189 the arm is similar to the space shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other the european robotic arm which will service the ros was launched alongside the nauka module190 the ros does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way crew use the two strela russian lit arrow cargo cranes during evas for moving crew and equipment around the ros each strela crane has a mass of 45 kg 99 lb pirs russian lit pier was launched on 14 september 2001 as iss assembly mission 4r on a russian soyuzu rocket using a modified progress spacecraft progress mso1 as an upper stage pirs was undocked by progress ms16 on 26 july 2021 1056 utc and deorbited on the same day at 1451 utc to make room for the nauka module to be attached to the space station prior to its departure pirs served as the primary russian airlock on the station being used to store and refurbish the russian orlan spacesuits in january 2020 nasa awarded axiom space a contract to build a commercial module for the iss the contract is under the nextstep2 program nasa negotiated with axiom on a firm fixedprice contract basis to build and deliver the module which will attach to the forward port of the space stations harmony node 2 module although nasa only commissioned one module axiom planned to build an entire segment consisting of five modules including a node module an orbital research and manufacturing facility a crew habitat and a largewindowed earth observatory the axiom segment was expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations axiom planned to convert the segment into a standalone space station once the iss is decommissioned with the intention that this would act as a successor to the iss191192193 canadarm2 is planned to continue its operations on axiom station after the retirement of iss in 2030194 in december 2024 axiom space revised their station assembly plans to require only one module to dock with the iss before assembling axiom station in an independent orbit195 as of december 2024update axiom space expects to launch one module the payload power thermal module pptm to the iss no earlier than 2027195 pptm is expected to remain at the iss until the launch of axioms habitat one hab1 module about one year later after which it will detach from the iss to join with hab1195 the us deorbit vehicle usdv is a nasaprovided spacecraft intended to perform a controlled deorbit and demise of the station after the end of its operational life in 2030 in june 2024 nasa awarded spacex a contract to build the deorbit vehicle196 nasa plans to deorbit iss as soon as they have the minimum capability in orbit the usdv and at least one commercial station197 several modules developed or planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the iss programme reasons include budgetary constraints the modules becoming unnecessary and station redesigns after the 2003 columbia disaster the us centrifuge accommodations module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity198 the us habitation module would have served as the stations living quarters instead the living quarters are now spread throughout the station199 the us interim control module and iss propulsion module would have replaced the functions of zvezda in case of a launch failure200 two russian research modules were planned for scientific research201 they would have docked to a russian universal docking module202 the russian science power platform would have supplied power to the russian orbital segment independent of the its solar arrays science power module 1 spm1 also known as nem1 and science power module 2 spm2 also known as nem2 are modules that were originally planned to arrive at the iss no earlier than 2024 and dock to the prichal module which is docked to the nauka module150203 in april 2021 roscosmos announced that nem1 would be repurposed to function as the core module of the proposed russian orbital service station ross launching no earlier than 2027204 and docking to the freeflying nauka module205206 nem2 may be converted into another core base module which would be launched in 2028207 designed by bigelow aerospace in august 2016 bigelow negotiated an agreement with nasa to develop a fullsize ground prototype deep space habitation based on the b330 under the second phase of next space technologies for exploration partnerships the module was called the expandable bigelow advanced station enhancement xbase as bigelow hoped to test the module by attaching it to the international space station however in march 2020 bigelow laid off all 88 of its employees and as of february 2024update the company remains dormant and is considered defunct208209 making it appear unlikely that the xbase module will ever be launched a proposal was put forward in 2011 for a first inspace demonstration of a sufficiently scaled centrifuge for artificial partialg gravity effects it was designed to become a sleep module for the iss crew the project was cancelled in favour of other projects due to budget constraints210 the critical systems are the atmosphere control system the water supply system the food supply facilities the sanitation and hygiene equipment and fire detection and suppression equipment the russian orbital segments lifesupport systems are contained in the zvezda service module some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the usos the nauka laboratory has a complete set of lifesupport systems the atmosphere on board the iss is similar to that of earth211 normal air pressure on the iss is 1013 kpa 1469 psi212 the same as at sea level on earth an earthlike atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort and is much safer than a pure oxygen atmosphere because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of the apollo 1 crew213better source needed earthlike atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all russian and soviet spacecraft214 the elektron system aboard zvezda and a similar system in destiny generate oxygen aboard the station215 the crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and solid fuel oxygen generation sfog canisters a chemical oxygen generator system216 carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the vozdukh system in zvezda other byproducts of human metabolism such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat are removed by activated charcoal filters216 part of the ros atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply tripleredundancy is provided by the elektron unit solid fuel generators and stored oxygen the primary supply of oxygen is the elektron unit which produces o2 and h2 by electrolysis of water and vents h2 overboard the 1 kw 13 hp system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day this water is either brought from earth or recycled from other systems mir was the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production the secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning oxygenproducing vika cartridges see also iss eclss each candle takes 520 minutes to decompose at 450500 c 842932 f producing 600 litres 130 imp gal 160 us gal of o2 this unit is manually operated217 the us orbital segment usos has redundant supplies of oxygen from a pressurised storage tank on the quest airlock module delivered in 2001 supplemented ten years later by esabuilt advanced closedloop system acls in the tranquility module node 3 which produces o2 by electrolysis218 hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane doublesided solar arrays provide electrical power to the iss these bifacial cells collect direct sunlight on one side and light reflected off from the earth on the other and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than singlesided cells commonly used on earth219 the russian segment of the station like most spacecraft uses 28 v low voltage dc from two rotating solar arrays mounted on zvezda the usos uses 130180 v dc from the usos pv array power is stabilised and distributed at 160 v dc and converted to the userrequired 124 v dc the higher distribution voltage allows smaller lighter conductors at the expense of crew safety the two station segments share power with converters the usos solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts3 these arrays normally track the sun to maximise power generation each array is about 375 m2 4036 sq ft in area and 58 m 190 ft long in the complete configuration the solar arrays track the sun by rotating the alpha gimbal once per orbit the beta gimbal follows slower changes in the angle of the sun to the orbital plane the night glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the stations relatively low orbital altitude220 the station originally used rechargeable nickelhydrogen batteries nih2 for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the earth the batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit they had a 65year lifetime over 37000 chargedischarge cycles and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20year life of the station221 starting in 2016 the nickelhydrogen batteries were replaced by lithiumion batteries which are expected to last until the end of the iss program222 the stations large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere this could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath to mitigate this plasma contactor units create current paths between the station and the ambient space plasma223 the stations systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power almost all of which is converted to heat to keep the internal temperature within workable limits a passive thermal control system ptcs is made of external surface materials insulation such as mli and heat pipes if the ptcs cannot keep up with the heat load an external active thermal control system eatcs maintains the temperature the eatcs consists of an internal nontoxic water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop from the heat exchangers ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation then the ammonia is cycled back to the station224 the eatcs provides cooling for all the us pressurised modules including kib and columbus as well as the main power distribution electronics of the s0 s1 and p1 trusses it can reject up to 70 kw this is much more than the 14 kw of the early external active thermal control system eeatcs via the early ammonia servicer eas which was launched on sts105 and installed onto the p6 truss225 the iss relies on various radio communication systems to provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and mission control centres radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members flight controllers and family members as a result the iss is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes226 the russian orbital segment primarily uses the lira antenna mounted on zvezda for direct ground communication63227 it also had the capability to utilize the luch data relay satellite system63 which was in a state of disrepair when the station was built63228229 but was restored to operational status in 2011 and 2012 with the launch of luch5a and luch5b230 additionally the voskhodm system provides internal telephone communications and vhf radio links to ground control231 the us orbital segment usos makes use of two separate radio links s band audio telemetry commanding located on the p1s1 truss and ku band audio video and data located on the z1 truss systems these transmissions are routed via the united states tracking and data relay satellite system tdrss in geostationary orbit allowing for almost continuous realtime communications with christopher c kraft jr mission control center mcch in houston texas63232226 data channels for the canadarm2 european columbus laboratory and japanese kib modules were originally also routed via the s band and ku band systems with the european data relay system and a similar japanese system intended to eventually complement the tdrss in this role232233 uhf radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting evas and other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station63 automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment the atv used a laser attached to the spacecraft and the proximity communications equipment attached to zvezda to accurately dock with the station234235 the us orbital segment of the iss is equipped with approximately 100 commercial offtheshelf laptops running windows or linux236 these devices are modified to use the stations 28v dc power system and with additional ventilation since heat generated by the devices can stagnate in the weightless environment nasa prefers to keep a high commonality between laptops and spare parts are kept on the station so astronauts can repair laptops when needed237 the laptops are divided into two groups the portable computer system pcs and station support computers ssc pcs laptops run linux and are used for connecting to the stations primary command control computer cc mdm which runs on debian linux238 a switch made from windows in 2013 for reliability and flexibility239 the primary computer supervises the critical systems that keep the station in orbit and supporting life236 since the primary computer has no display or keyboards astronauts use a pcs laptop to connect as remote terminals via a usb to 1553 adapter240 the primary computer experienced failures in 2001241 2007242 and 2017 the 2017 failure required a spacewalk to replace external components243 ssc laptops are used for everything else on the station including reviewing procedures managing scientific experiments communicating over email or video chat and for entertainment during downtime236 ssc laptops connect to the stations wireless lan via wifi which connects to the ground via the ku band while originally this provided speeds of 10 mbits download and 3 mbits upload from the station244 nasa upgraded the system in 2019 and increased the speeds to 600 mbits245 iss crew members have access to the internet246247 each permanent crew is given an expedition number expeditions run up to six months from launch until undocking an increment covers the same time period but includes cargo spacecraft and all activities expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of threeperson crews after the destruction of nasas space shuttle columbia expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to twoperson caretaker crews who could maintain the station because a larger crew could not be fully resupplied by the small russian progress cargo spacecraft248 after the shuttle fleet returned to flight three person crews also returned to the iss beginning with expedition 13 as the shuttle flights expanded the station crew sizes also expanded eventually reaching six around 2010249250 with the arrival of crew on larger us commercial spacecraft beginning in 2020251 crew size has been increased to seven the number for which iss was originally designed252253 oleg kononenko of roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the iss accumulating nearly 1111 days in space over the course of five longduration missions on the iss expedition 17 3031 4445 575859 and 697071 he also served as commander three times expedition 31 5859 and 7071254 peggy whitson of nasa and axiom space has spent the most time in space of any american accumulating over 675 days in space during her time on expeditions 5 16 and 505152 and axiom missions 2 and 4255256 travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by roscosmos and nasa and are sometimes referred to as space tourists a term they generally disliked as of june 2023update thirteen space tourists have visited the iss nine were transported to the iss on russian soyuz spacecraft and four were transported on american spacex dragon 2 spacecraft for onetourist missions when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a soyuz and a shortstay crewmember is not sent the spare seat is sold by mircorp through space adventures space tourism was halted in 2011 when the space shuttle was retired and the stations crew size was reduced to six as the partners relied on russian transport seats for access to the station soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013 allowing five soyuz flights 15 seats with only two expeditions 12 seats required264 the remaining seats were to be sold for around us40 million each to members of the public who could pass a medical exam esa and nasa criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the iss and nasa initially resisted training dennis tito the first person to pay for his own passage to the isse anousheh ansari became the first selffunded woman to fly to the iss as well as the first iranian in space officials reported that her education and experience made her much more than a tourist and her performance in training had been excellent265 she did russian and european studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10day stay the 2009 documentary space tourists follows her journey to the station where she fulfilled an ageold dream of man to leave our planet as a normal person and travel into outer space266 in 2008 spaceflight participant richard garriott placed a geocache aboard the iss during his flight267 this is the first nonterrestrial geocache in history268 at the same time the immortality drive an electronic record of eight digitised human dna sequences was placed aboard the iss269 after a 12year hiatus the first two wholly space tourismdedicated private spaceflights to the iss were undertaken soyuz ms20 launched in december 2021 carrying visiting roscosmos cosmonaut alexander misurkin and two japanese space tourists under the aegis of the private company space adventures270271 in april 2022 the company axiom space chartered a spacex dragon 2 spacecraft and sent its own employee astronaut michael lopezalegria and three space tourists to the iss for axiom mission 1272273274 followed in may 2023 by one more tourist john shoffner alongside employee astronaut peggy whitson and two saudi astronauts for the axiom mission 2275276 the first all private astronaut mission pam to the iss was axiom mission 1 which launched in april 2022277 after evaluating previous flights to iss which included private spaceflight participants and the first three flights including only private astronauts nasa updated requirements for entities providing pams278 as of august 2025update the most recent mission was axiom mission 4 nasa intends to offer up to two pam opportunities per year279 various crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have supported the stations operations flights to the iss have included 92 progressf 72 soyuz 50 spacex dragong 37 space shuttle 20 cygnus 9 htv 5 atv and 2 boeing starliner missions280 there are currently eight docking ports for visiting spacecraft with four additional ports installed but not yet put into service281 forward ports are at the front of the station in its usual orientation and direction of travel aft is the opposite at the rear nadir points toward earth while zenith points away from it port is to the left and starboard to the right when ones feet are toward earth and one is facing forward in the direction of travel cargo spacecraft that will perform an orbital reboost of the station will typically dock at an aft forward or nadirfacing port as of 4 august 2025ref a total of 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the international space station iss including both governmentsponsored astronauts and privately funded spaceflight participants the united states accounted for 170 of these visitors followed by russia with 64 japan with 11 and canada with 9 italy had 6 visitors while france and germany had each sent 4 saudi arabia sweden and the united arab emirates each had 2 individuals visit the iss one person had traveled to the iss from each of the following countries belarus belgium brazil denmark hungary india israel kazakhstan malaysia the netherlands poland south africa south korea spain turkey and the united kingdom282 uncrewed spaceflights are primarily used to deliver cargo to the station including crew supplies scientific investigations spacewalk equipment vehicle hardware propellant water and gases cargo resupply missions have typically used russian progress spacecraft the nowretired european atv the japanese htv and american dragon and cygnus spacecraft additionally several russian modules have been launched on uncrewed rockets and autonomously docked with the station all dates are utc departure dates are the earliest possible net and may change all dates are utc launch dates are the earliest possible net and may change the russian spacecraft and can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention once within approximately 200 kilometres 120 mi the spacecraft begins receiving radio signals from the kurs docking navigation system on the station as the spacecraft nears the station laserbased optical equipment precisely aligns the craft with the docking port and controls the final approach while the crew on the iss and spacecraft monitor the procedure their role is primarily supervisory with intervention limited to issuing abort commands in emergencies although initial development costs were substantial the systems reliability and standardized components have yielded significant cost reductions for subsequent missions284 the american spacex dragon 2 cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention however on crewed dragon missions the astronauts have the capability to intervene and fly the vehicle manually285 other automated cargo spacecraft typically use a semiautomated process when arriving and departing from the station these spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station once the crew on board the station is ready the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using the mobile servicing system robotic arm the final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm a process known as berthing spacecraft using this semiautomated process include the american cygnus and the japanese htvx the nowretired american spacex dragon 1 european atv and japanese htv also used this process prior to a spacecrafts docking to the iss navigation and attitude control gnc is handed over to the ground control of the spacecrafts country of origin gnc is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes the solar panels of the station are turned edgeon to the incoming spacecraft so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells before its retirement shuttle launches were often given priority over soyuz with occasional priority given to soyuz arrivals carrying crew and timecritical cargoes such as biological experiment materials286 orbital replacement units orus are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails examples of orus are pumps storage tanks controller boxes antennas and battery units some units can be replaced using robotic arms most are stored outside the station either on small pallets called express logistics carriers elcs or share larger platforms called external stowage platforms esps which also hold science experiments both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating the larger logistics carriers also have local area network lan connections for telemetry to connect experiments a heavy emphasis on stocking the usos with orus occurred around 2011 before the end of the nasa shuttle programme as its commercial replacements cygnus and dragon carry one tenth to one quarter the payload unexpected problems and failures have impacted the stations assembly timeline and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and in some cases could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons serious problems include an air leak from the usos in 2004287 the venting of fumes from an elektron oxygen generator in 2006288 and the failure of the computers in the ros in 2007 during sts117 that left the station without thruster elektron vozdukh and other environmental control system operations in the latter case the root cause was found to be condensation inside electrical connectors leading to a short circuit289 during sts120 in 2007 and following the relocation of the p6 truss and solar arrays it was noted during unfurling that the solar array had torn and was not deploying properly290 an eva was carried out by scott parazynski assisted by douglas wheelock extra precautions were taken to reduce the risk of electric shock as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight291 the issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard solar alpha rotary joint sarj which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station excessive vibration and highcurrent spikes in the array drive motor were noted resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard sarj until the cause was understood inspections during evas on sts120 and sts123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic bearing surfaces so the joint was locked to prevent further damage292293 repairs to the joints were carried out during sts126 with lubrication and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint294295 in september 2008 damage to the s1 radiator was first noticed in soyuz imagery the problem was initially not thought to be serious296 the imagery showed that the surface of one subpanel had peeled back from the underlying central structure possibly because of micrometeoroid or debris impact on 15 may 2009 the damaged radiator panels ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computercontrolled closure of a valve the same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak296 it is also known that a service module thruster cover struck the s1 radiator after being jettisoned during an eva in 2008 but its effect if any has not been determined in the early hours of 1 august 2010 a failure in cooling loop a starboard side one of two external cooling loops left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems297298299 the problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid several subsystems including two of the four cmgs were shut down planned operations on the iss were interrupted through a series of evas to address the cooling system issue a first eva on 7 august 2010 to replace the failed pump module was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quickdisconnects a second eva on 11 august removed the failed pump module300301 a third eva was required to restore loop a to normal functionality302303 the usoss cooling system is largely built by the us company boeing304 which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump297 the four main bus switching units mbsus located in the s0 truss control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the iss each mbsu has two power channels that feed 160v dc from the arrays to two dctodc power converters ddcus that supply the 124v power used in the station in late 2011 mbsu1 ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health while still routing power correctly it was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available eva a spare mbsu was already on board but a 30 august 2012 eva failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before the electrical connection was secured305 the loss of mbsu1 limited the station to 75 of its normal power capacity requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem could be addressed on 5 september 2012 in a second sixhour eva astronauts sunita williams and akihiko hoshide successfully replaced mbsu1 and restored the iss to 100 power306 on 24 december 2013 astronauts installed a new ammonia pump for the stations cooling system the faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month halting many of the stations science experiments astronauts had to brave a mini blizzard of ammonia while installing the new pump it was only the second christmas eve spacewalk in nasa history307 the components of the iss are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at mission control centres across the globe primarily the christopher c kraft jr mission control center in houston and the rka mission control center tsup in moscow with support from tsukuba space center in japan payload operations and integration center in huntsville alabama us columbus control center in munich germany and mobile servicing system control at the canadian space agencys headquarters in sainthubert quebec the iss is currently maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 370 km 230 mi and a maximum of 460 km 290 mi308 in the centre of the thermosphere at an inclination of 516 degrees to earths equator309 with an eccentricity of 00002267310needs update this orbit was selected because it is the lowest inclination that can be directly reached by russian soyuz and progress spacecraft launched from baikonur cosmodrome at 46 n latitude without overflying china or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas311312 it travels at an average speed of 28000 kilometres per hour 17000 mph and completes 155 orbits per day 93 minutes per orbit4313 the stations altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each nasa shuttle flight to permit heavier loads to be transferred to the station after the retirement of the shuttle the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude from about 350 km to about 400 km314315 other more frequent supply spacecraft do not require this adjustment as they are substantially higher performance vehicles29316 atmospheric drag reduces the altitude by about 2 km a month on average orbital boosting can be performed by the stations two main engines on the zvezda service module or russian or european spacecraft docked to zvezdas aft port the automated transfer vehicle is constructed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its aft end allowing other craft to dock and boost the station it takes approximately two orbits three hours for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed316 maintaining iss altitude uses about 75 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum317 at an annual cost of about 210 million318 the russian orbital segment contains the data management system which handles guidance navigation and control ros gnc for the entire station319 initially zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the russian service module zvezda docked and was transferred control zvezda contains the esa built dmsr data management system320 using two faulttolerant computers ftc zvezda computes the stations position and orbital trajectory using redundant earth horizon sensors solar horizon sensors as well as sun and star trackers the ftcs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced faultmasking by majority voting zvezda uses gyroscopes reaction wheels and thrusters to turn itself gyroscopes do not require propellant instead they use electricity to store momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the stations movement the usos has its own computercontrolled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass when gyroscopes saturate thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum in february 2005 during expedition 10 an incorrect command was sent to the stations computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed when attitude control computers in the ros and usos fail to communicate properly this can result in a rare force fight where the ros gnc computer must ignore the usos counterpart which itself has no thrusters321322323 docked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting or during the installation of the s3s4 truss which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the stations electronics324 the low altitudes at which the iss orbits are also home to a variety of space debris325 including spent rocket stages defunct satellites explosion fragments including materials from antisatellite weapon tests paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors and coolant released by usa nuclearpowered satellites these objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids326 are a significant threat objects large enough to destroy the station can be tracked and therefore are not as dangerous as smaller debris327328 objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size number in the trillions despite their small size some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station spacewalking crew in spacesuits are also at risk of suit damage and consequent exposure to vacuum329 ballistic panels also called micrometeorite shielding are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems the type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage the stations shields and structure have different designs on the ros and the usos on the usos whipple shields are used the us segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1550 cmthick 059197 in aluminium a 10 cmthick 39 in intermediate layers of kevlar and nextel a ceramic fabric330 and an outer layer of stainless steel which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull thereby spreading the energy of impact on the ros a carbon fibre reinforced polymer honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that with a screenvacuum thermal insulation covering and glass cloth over the top331 space debris is tracked remotely from the ground and the station crew can be notified332 if necessary thrusters on the russian orbital segment can alter the stations orbital altitude avoiding the debris these debris avoidance manoeuvres dams are not uncommon taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance ten dams had been performed by the end of 2009333334335 usually an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 ms is used to raise the orbit by one or two kilometres if necessary the altitude can also be lowered although such a manoeuvre wastes propellant334336 if a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a dam to be safely conducted the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their spacecraft in order to be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris partial station evacuations have occurred on 13 march 2009 28 june 2011 24 march 2012 16 june 2015337 november 2021338 and 27 june 2024339 the november 2021 evacuation was caused by a russian antisatellite weapon test340341 nasa administrator bill nelson said it was unthinkable that russia would endanger the lives of everyone on iss including their own cosmonauts342 the iss is visible in the sky to the naked eye as a visibly moving bright white dot when crossing the sky and being illuminated by the sun during twilight the hours after sunset and before sunrise when the station remains sunlit outside of earths shadow but the ground and sky are dark343 it crosses the skies at latitudes between the polar regions344 depending on the path it takes across the sky the time it takes the station to move across the horizon or from one to the other may be short or up to 10 minutes while likely being only visible part of that time because of it moving into or out of earths shadow it then returns around every 90 minutes with the time of the day that it crosses the sky shifting over the course of some weeks and therefore before returning to twilight and visible illumination because of the size of its reflective surface area the iss is the brightest artificial object in the sky excluding other satellite flares with an approximate maximum magnitude of 4 when in sunlight and overhead similar to venus and a maximum angular size of 63 arcseconds345 tools are provided by a number of websites such as heavensabove see live viewing below as well as smartphone applications that use orbital data and the observers longitude and latitude to indicate when the iss will be visible weather permitting where the station will appear to rise the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into earths shadow346347348349 in november 2012 nasa launched its spot the station service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town350 the station is visible from 95 of the inhabited land on earth but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes311 under specific conditions the iss can be observed at night on five consecutive orbits those conditions are 1 a midlatitude observer location 2 near the time of the solstice with 3 the iss passing in the direction of the pole from the observer near midnight local time the three photos show the first middle and last of the five passes on 56 june 2014 using a telescopemounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers351 while using a mounted camera to photograph the earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew352 the use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the iss during daylight hours353 transits of the iss in front of the sun particularly during an eclipse and so the earth sun moon and iss are all positioned approximately in a single line are of particular interest for amateur astronomers354355 gravity at the altitude of the iss is approximately 90 as strong as at earths surface but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness356 this perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five effects357 the iss is partially protected from the space environment by earths magnetic field from an average distance of about 70000 km 43000 mi from the earths surface depending on solar activity the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around earth and the space station solar flares are still a hazard to the crew who may receive only a few minutes warning in 2005 during the initial proton storm of an x3 class solar flare the crew of expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ros designed for this purpose358359 subatomic charged particles primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind are normally absorbed by earths atmosphere when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora outside earths atmosphere iss crews are exposed to approximately one millisievert each day about a years worth of natural exposure on earth resulting in a higher risk of cancer radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the dna and chromosomes of lymphocytes being central to the immune system any damage to these cells could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts protective shielding and medications may lower the risks to an acceptable level47 radiation levels on the iss are between 12 and 288 milli rads per day360 about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew as earths electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other types of radiation in low earth orbit as in the stratosphere for example on a 12hour flight an airline passenger would experience 01 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 02 millisieverts per day this is one fifth the rate experienced by an astronaut in leo additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while the iss crew are exposed for their whole stay on board the station361 hazardous molds that can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations they can produce acids that degrade metal glass and rubber they can also be harmful to the crews health microbiological hazards have led to a development of the locadpts a portable test system which identifies common bacteria and molds faster than standard methods of culturing which may require a sample to be sent back to earth362 researchers in 2018 reported after detecting the presence of five enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains on the iss none of which are pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on the iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts363364 contamination on space stations can be prevented by reduced humidity and by using paint that contains moldkilling chemicals as well as the use of antiseptic solutions all materials used in the iss are tested for resistance against fungi365 since 2016 a series of esasponsored experiments have been conducted to test the antibacterial properties of various materials with the goal of developing smart surfaces that mitigate bacterial growth in multiple ways using the best method for a particular circumstance dubbed microbial aerosol tethering on innovative surfaces matiss the programme involves deployment of small plaques containing an array of glass squares covered with different test coatings they remain on the station for six months before being returned to earth for analysis366 the most recent and final experiment of the series was launched on 5 june 2023 aboard the spacex crs28 cargo mission to iss comprising four plaques whereas previous experiments in the series were limited to analysis by light microsocopy this experiment uses quartz glass made of pure silica which will allow spectrographic analysis two of the plaques were returned after eight months and the remaining two after 16 months367 in april 2019 nasa reported that a comprehensive study had been conducted into the microorganisms and fungi present on the iss the experiment was performed over a period of 14 months on three different flight missions and involved taking samples from 8 predefined locations inside the station then returning them to earth for analysis in prior experiments analysis was limited to culturebased methods thus overlooking microbes which cannot be grown in culture the present study used molecularbased methods in addition to culturing resulting in a more complete catalog the results may be useful in improving the health and safety conditions for astronauts as well as better understanding other closedin environments on earth such as clean rooms used by the pharmaceutical and medical industries368369 space flight is not inherently quiet with noise levels exceeding acoustic standards as far back as the apollo missions370371 for this reason nasa and the international space station international partners have developed noise control and hearing loss prevention goals as part of the health program for crew members specifically these goals have been the primary focus of the iss multilateral medical operations panel mmop acoustics subgroup since the first days of iss assembly and operations372373 the effort includes contributions from acoustical engineers audiologists industrial hygienists and physicians who comprise the subgroups membership from nasa roscosmos the european space agency esa the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa and the canadian space agency csa when compared to terrestrial environments the noise levels experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts on the iss may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to the occupational safety and health administration rarely reaching 85 dba but crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day seven days a week with current missions averaging six months in duration these levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication as well as reduced alarm audibility over the 19 plus year history of the iss significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the iss during design and preflight activities members of the acoustic subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch372 573 during spaceflights the acoustics subgroup has assessed each iss modules in flight sound levels produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards the acoustic environment on iss changed when additional modules were added during its construction and as additional spacecraft arrive at the iss the acoustics subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers absorptive materials noise barriers and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels moreover when pumps fans and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels this acoustics subgroup has guided iss managers to replace the older noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies significantly reducing ambient noise levels nasa has adopted mostconservative damage risk criteria based on recommendations from the national institute for occupational safety and health and the world health organization in order to protect all crew members the mmop acoustics subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying or modifying terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits one innovative approach has been nasas noise exposure estimation tool neet in which noise exposures are calculated in a taskbased approach to determine the need for hearing protection devices hpds guidance for use of hpds either mandatory use or recommended is then documented in the noise hazard inventory and posted for crew reference during their missions the acoustics subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances applies engineering controls and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures finally hearing thresholds are monitored onorbit during missions there have been no persistent missionrelated hearing threshold shifts among us orbital segment crewmembers jaxa csa esa nasa during what is approaching 20 years of iss mission operations or nearly 175000 work hours in 2020 the mmop acoustics subgroup received the safeinsound award for innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise374 an onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards ammonia is used in the external radiators of the station and could potentially leak into the pressurised modules375 on 12 april 2019 nasa reported medical results from the astronaut twin study astronaut scott kelly spent a year in space on the iss while his identical twin spent the year on earth several longlasting changes were observed including those related to alterations in dna and cognition when one twin was compared with the other376377 in november 2019 researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clot problems while on board the iss based on a sixmonth study of 11 healthy astronauts the results may influence longterm spaceflight including a mission to the planet mars according to the researchers378379 there is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance380 cosmonaut valery ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the salyut 6 space station all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 55 m 6 m and leave them together for two months nasas interest in psychological stress caused by space travel initially studied when their crewed missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the russian space station mir common sources of stress in early us missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family the latter is still often a cause of stress on the iss such as when the mother of nasa astronaut daniel tani died in a car accident and when michael fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child a study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment381 iss crew flights typically last about five to six months the iss working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language firstgeneration space stations had crews who spoke a single language second and thirdgeneration stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages astronauts must speak english and russian and knowing additional languages is even better382 due to the lack of gravity confusion often occurs even though there is no up and down in space some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down they may also have difficulty measuring distances this can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking383 the physiological effects of longterm weightlessness include muscle atrophy deterioration of the skeleton osteopenia fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass and puffiness of the face47 sleep is regularly disturbed on the iss because of mission demands such as incoming or departing spacecraft sound levels in the station are unavoidably high the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon naturally so fans are required at all times to process the air which would stagnate in the freefall zerog environment to prevent some of the adverse effects on the body the station is equipped with two tvis treadmills including the colbert the ared advanced resistive exercise device which enables various weightlifting exercises that add muscle without raising or compensating for the astronauts reduced bone density384 and a stationary bicycle each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment385386 astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill387388 the living and working space aboard the international space station iss is larger than a sixbedroom house equipped with seven private sleeping quarters three bathrooms two dining rooms a gym and a panoramic 360degreeview bay window389 the station provides dedicated crew quarters for longterm crew members two sleep stations are located in the zvezda module one in nauka and four in harmony390391392393 these soundproof personsized booths offer privacy ventilation and basic amenities such as a sleeping bag a reading lamp a desktop a shelf and storage for personal items385386394 the quarters in zvezda include a small window but have less ventilation and soundproofing visiting crew members use tethered sleeping bags attached to available wall space while it is possible to sleep floating freely this is generally avoided to prevent collisions with sensitive equipment395 proper ventilation is critical as astronauts risk oxygen deprivation if exhaled carbon dioxide accumulates in a bubble around their heads385 the stations lighting system is adjustable allowing for dimming switching off and colour temperature changes to support crew activities and rest396397 the iss operates on coordinated universal time utc398 a typical day aboard the iss begins at 0600 with wakeup postsleep routines and a morning inspection of the station after breakfast the crew holds a daily planning conference with mission control starting work around 0810 morning tasks include scheduled exercise scientific experiments maintenance or operational duties following a onehour lunch break at 1305 the crew resumes their afternoon schedule of work and exercise presleep activities including dinner and a crew conference begin at 1930 with the scheduled sleep period starting at 2130399 the crew works approximately 10 hours on weekdays and 5 hours on saturdays with the remaining time allocated for relaxation or catching up on tasks free time often involves enjoying personal hobbies communicating with family or gazing out at earth through the stations windows399 the crew can watch tv aboard the station400 when the space shuttle was operating the iss crew aligned with the shuttle crews mission elapsed time a flexible schedule based on the shuttles launch401402403 to simulate night conditions the stations windows are covered during designated sleep periods as the iss experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets daily due to its orbital speed reflection of individual and crew characteristics are found particularly in the decoration of the station and expressions in general such as religion404 the latter has produced a certain material economy between the station and russia in particular405 the microsociety of the station as well as wider society and possibly the emergence of distinct station cultures406 is being studied by analyzing many aspects from art to dust accumulation as well as archaeologically how material of the iss has been discarded407 on the usos most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity385 so efforts are taken to make the food more palatable including using more spices than in regular cooking the crew looks forward to the arrival of any spacecraft from earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables care is taken that foods do not create crumbs and liquid condiments are preferred over solid to avoid contaminating station equipment each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them in the galley which has two food warmers a refrigerator added in november 2008 and a water dispenser that provides heated and unheated water386 drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption386394 drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws while solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away any food that floats away including crumbs must be collected to prevent it from clogging the stations air filters and other equipment394 showers on space stations were introduced in the early 1970s on skylab and salyut 3408 139 by salyut 6 in the early 1980s the crew complained of the complexity of showering in space which was a monthly activity409 the iss does not feature a shower instead crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tubelike container crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water395410 there are two space toilets on the iss both of russian design located in zvezda and tranquility386 these waste and hygiene compartments use a fandriven suction system similar to the space shuttle waste collection system astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat which is equipped with springloaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal385 a lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open the air stream carries the waste away solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container full containers are transferred to progress spacecraft for disposal386411 liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically correct urine funnel adapters attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet the diverted urine is collected and transferred to the water recovery system where it is recycled into drinking water394 in 2021 the arrival of the nauka module also brought a third toilet to the iss412 originally the iss was planned to be a 15year mission413 therefore an end of mission had been worked on414 but was several times postponed due to the success and support for the operation of the station415 as a result the oldest modules of the iss have been in orbit for more than 20 years with their reliability having decreased414 it has been proposed to use funds elsewhere instead for example for a return to the moon415 according to the outer space treaty the parties are legally responsible for all spacecraft or modules they launch416 an unmaintained station would pose an orbital and reentry hazard russia has stated that it plans to pull out of the iss program after 2025417 however russian modules will provide orbital stationkeeping until 2028414 the us planned in 2009 to deorbit the iss in 2016415 but on 30 september 2015 boeings contract with nasa as prime contractor for the iss was extended to 30 september 2020 part of boeings services under the contract related to extending the stations primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028418 in july 2018 the space frontier act of 2018 was intended to extend operations of the iss to 2030 this bill was unanimously approved in the senate but failed to pass in the us house419420 in september 2018 the leading human spaceflight act was introduced with the intent to extend operations of the iss to 2030 and was confirmed in december 2018421422423 congress later passed similar provisions in its chips and science act signed into law by us president joe biden on 9 august 2022424425 if until 2031 commercial leo destinations providers are not sufficient to accommodate nasas projects nasa is suggesting to extend iss operations beyond 2031426 nasa considered originally several possible disposal options natural orbital decay with random reentry as with skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude which would delay reentry and a controlled deorbit targeting a remote ocean area427 nasa determined that random reentry carried an unacceptable risk of producing hazardous space debris that could hit people or property and reboosting the station would be costly and could also create hazards prior to 2010 plans had contemplated using a slightly modified progress spacecraft to deorbit the iss however nasa concluded progress would not be adequate for the job and decided on a spacecraft specifically designed for the task428 in january 2022 nasa announced a planned date of january 2031 to deorbit the iss using the us deorbit vehicle and direct any remnants into a remote area of the south pacific ocean that has come to be known as the spacecraft cemetery429 nasa plans to launch the deorbit vehicle in 2030 docking at the harmony forward port430 the deorbit vehicle will remain attached dormant for about a year as the stations orbit naturally decays to 220 km 140 mi the spacecraft would then conduct one or more orientation burns to lower the perigee to 150 km 93 mi followed by a final deorbiting burn431432 nasa began planning for the deorbit vehicle after becoming wary of russia pulling out of the iss abruptly leaving the other partners with few good options for a controlled reentry433 in june 2024 nasa selected spacex to develop the us deorbit vehicle a contract potentially worth 843 million the vehicle will consist of an existing cargo dragon spacecraft which will be paired with a significantly lengthened trunk module which will be equipped with 46 draco thrusters instead of the normal 16 and will carry 30000 kg 66000 lb of propellant nearly six times the normal load nasa is still working to secure all the necessary funding to build launch and operate the deorbit vehicle15433 on 20 february 2025 elon musk ceo of spacex and senior advisor to president trump suggested in a tweet that the international space station be deorbited two years from now as musk believes the station has served its purpose and has very little incremental utility despite this no official decisions on moving up the deorbiting date have been made yet by the president434435 the followup to nasas programstrategy is the commercial leo destinations program meant to allow private industry to build and maintain their own stations and nasa procuring access as a customer starting in 2028436 similarly the esa has been seeking new private space stations to provide orbital services as well as retrieve materials from the iss437438 axiom station is planned to begin as a single module temporarily hosted at the iss in 2027195 additionally there have been suggestions in the commercial space industry that the iss could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities439 including turning it into a space hotel415 russia previously has planned to use its orbital segment for the construction of its opsek station after the iss is decommissioned the modules under consideration for removal from the current iss included the multipurpose laboratory module nauka mlm launched in july 2021 and the other new russian modules that are proposed to be attached to nauka these newly launched modules would still be well within their useful lives in 2024440 at the end of 2011 the exploration gateway platform concept also proposed using leftover usos hardware and zvezda 2 as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the earthmoon lagrange points however the entire usos was not designed for disassembly and will be discarded441 western space industry has suggested in 2022 using the iss as a platform to develop orbital salvage capacities by companies such as cislunar industries working on using space debris as fuel442 instead of plunging it into the ocean417 nasa has stated that by july 2024 it has not seen any viable proposals for reuse of the iss or parts of it426 the iss has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed443 as of 2010 the total cost was us150 billion this includes nasas budget of 587 billion 8973 billion in 2021 dollars for the station from 1985 to 2015 russias 12 billion europes 5 billion japans 5 billion canadas 2 billion and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station estimated at 14 billion each or 504 billion in total assuming 20000 mandays of use from 2000 to 2015 by two to sixperson crews each manday would cost 75 million less than half the inflationadjusted 196 million 55 million before inflation per manday of skylab444 the iss has become an international symbol of human capabilities particularly human cooperation and science445 defining a cooperative international approach and period instead of a looming commercialized and militarized interplanetary world446 beside numerous documentaries such as the imax documentaries space station 3d from 2002447 or a beautiful planet from 2016448 and films like apogee of fear 2012449 and yolki 5 2016450451 the iss is the subject of feature films such as the day after tomorrow 2004452 love 2011453 together with the chinese station tiangong 1 in gravity 2013454 life 2017455 and iss 2023456 in 2022 the movie the challenge doctors house call was filmed aboard the iss and was notable for being the first feature film in which both professional actors and director worked together in space457
