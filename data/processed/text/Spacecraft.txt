a spacecraft is a vehicle that is designed to fly and operate in outer space1 spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes including communications earth observation meteorology navigation space colonization planetary exploration and transportation of humans and cargo all spacecraft except singlestagetoorbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own and require a launch vehicle carrier rocket on a suborbital spaceflight a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full earth orbit for orbital spaceflights spacecraft enter closed orbits around the earth or around other celestial bodies spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit space stations only whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites to date only a handful of interstellar probes such as pioneer 10 and 11 voyager 1 and 2 and new horizons are on trajectories that leave the solar system orbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not most are not recoverable spacecraft may be subdivided by a method of reentry to earth into nonwinged space capsules and winged spaceplanes recoverable spacecraft may be reusable can be launched again or several times like the spacex dragon and the space shuttle orbiters or expendable like the soyuz in recent years more space agencies are tending towards reusable spacecraft humanity has achieved space flight but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches russia roscosmos2 the united states nasa3 the member states of the european space agency4 japan jaxa5 china cnsa6 india isro7 taiwan tsa8910 israel isa iran isa and north korea nada in addition several private companies have developed or are developing the technology for orbital launches independently from government agencies two prominent examples of such companies are spacex and blue origin a german v2 codesigned by wernher von braun became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189 km in june 1944 in peenemnde germany11 sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite it was launched into an elliptical low earth orbit leo by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 the launch ushered in new political military technological and scientific developments while the sputnik launch was a single event it marked the start of the space age1213 apart from its value as a technological first sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layers density by measuring the satellites orbital changes it also provided data on radiosignal distribution in the ionosphere pressurized nitrogen in the satellites false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection sputnik 1 was launched during the international geophysical year from site no15 at the 5th tyuratam range in kazakh ssr now at the baikonur cosmodrome the satellite travelled at 29000 kilometres per hour 18000 mph taking 962 minutes to complete an orbit and emitted radio signals at 20005 and 40002 mhz while sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the earth other humanmade objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km which is the height required by the international organization fdration aronautique internationale to count as a spaceflight this altitude is called the krmn line in particular in the 1940s there were several test launches of the v2 rocket some of which reached altitudes well over 100 km as of 2016 only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft ussrrussia usa and china the first crewed spacecraft was vostok 1 which carried soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into space in 1961 and completed a full earth orbit there were five other crewed missions which used a vostok spacecraft14 the second crewed spacecraft was named freedom 7 and it performed a suborbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying american astronaut alan shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers 116 mi there were five other crewed missions using mercury spacecraft other soviet crewed spacecraft include the voskhod soyuz flown uncrewed as zondl1 l3 tks and the salyut and mir crewed space stations other american crewed spacecraft include the gemini spacecraft the apollo spacecraft including the apollo lunar module the skylab space station the space shuttle with undetached european spacelab and private us spacehab space stationsmodules and the spacex crew dragon configuration of their dragon 2 us company boeing also developed and flown a spacecraft of their own the cst100 commonly referred to as starliner but a crewed flight is yet to occur china developed but did not fly shuguang and is currently using shenzhou its first crewed mission was in 2003 except for the space shuttle and the buran spaceplane of the soviet union the latter of which only ever had one uncrewed test flight all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules the international space station crewed since november 2000 is a joint venture between russia the united states canada and several other countries uncrewed spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input they may be remote controlled remote guided or even autonomous meaning they have a preprogrammed list of operations which they will execute unless otherwise instructed many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation due to lower cost and lower risk factors in addition some planetary destinations such as venus or the vicinity of jupiter are too hostile for human survival outer planets such as saturn uranus and neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by earth microorganisms since spacecraft can be sterilized humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship as they coexist with numerous microorganisms and these microorganisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit multiple space probes were sent to study moon the planets the sun multiple small solar system bodies comets and asteroids special class of uncrewed spacecraft is space telescopes a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects the first operational telescopes were the american orbiting astronomical observatory oao2 launched in 1968 and the soviet orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station salyut 1 in 1971 space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion scintillation of electromagnetic radiation which they observe and avoid light pollution which groundbased observatories encounter the bestknown examples are hubble space telescope and james webb space telescope cargo spacecraft are designed to carry cargo possibly to support space stations operation by transporting food propellant and other supplies automated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced salyut 6 salyut 7 mir the international space station and tiangong space station some spacecrafts can operate as both a crewed and uncrewed spacecraft for example the buran spaceplane could operate autonomously but also had manual controls though it never flew with crew onboard1516 other dual creweduncrewed spacecrafts include spacex dragon 217181920 dream chaser2122 and tianzhou2324 a communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on earth communications satellites are used for television telephone radio internet and military applications25 many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22300 miles 35900 km above the equator so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite others form satellite constellations in low earth orbit where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently the high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the earth the purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points26 communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies to avoid signal interference international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or bands certain organizations are allowed to use this allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference27 cargo or resupply spacecraft are robotic spacecraft that are designed specifically to carry cargo possibly to support space stations operation by transporting food propellant and other supplies automated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced salyut 6 salyut 7 mir the international space station and tiangong space station as of 2023 three different cargo spacecraft are used to supply the international space station russian progress american spacex dragon 2 and cygnus chinese tianzhou is used to supply tiangong space station space probes are robotic spacecraft that are sent to explore deep space or astronomical bodies other than earth they are distinguished from landers by the fact that they work in open space not on planetary surfaces or in planetary atmospheres being robotic eliminates the need for expensive heavy lifesupport systems the apollo crewed moon landings required the use of the saturn v rocket that cost over a billion dollars per launch adjusted for inflation and so allows for lighter less expensive rockets space probes have visited every planet in the solar system and pluto and the parker solar probe has an orbit that at its closest point is in the suns chromosphere there are five space probes that are escaping the solar system these are voyager 1 voyager 2 pioneer 10 pioneer 11 and new horizons the identical voyager probes weighing 7219 kilograms 1592 lb28 were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a rare alignment of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune that would allow a spacecraft to visit all four planets in one mission and get to each destination faster by using gravity assist in fact the rocket that launched the probes the titan iiie could not even send the probes to the orbit of saturn yet voyager 1 is travelling at roughly 17 kms 11 mis and voyager 2 moves at about 15 kms 93 mis kilometres per second as of 2023 in 2012 voyager 1 exited the heliosphere followed by voyager 2 in 2018 voyager 1 actually launched 16 days after voyager 2 but it reached jupiter sooner because voyager 2 was taking a longer route that allowed it to visit uranus and neptune whereas voyager 1 did not visit uranus or neptune instead choosing to fly past saturns satellite titan as of august 2023 voyager 1 has passed 160 astronomical units which means it is over 160 times farther from the sun than earth is this makes it the farthest spacecraft from the sun voyager 2 is 134 au away from the sun as of august 2023 nasa provides real time data of their distances and data from the probes cosmic ray detectors29 because of the probes declining power output and degradation of the rtgs over time nasa has had to shut down certain instruments to conserve power the probes may still have some scientific instruments on until the mid2020s or perhaps the 2030s after 2036 they will both be out of range of the deep space network a space telescope or space observatory is a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation which they observe and avoid light pollution which groundbased observatories encounter they are divided into two types satellites which map the entire sky astronomical survey and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond space telescopes are distinct from earth imaging satellites which point toward earth for satellite imaging applied for weather analysis espionage and other types of information gathering a lander is a type of spacecraft that makes a soft landing on the surface of an astronomical body other than earth some landers such as philae and the apollo lunar module land entirely by using their fuel supply however many landers and landings of spacecraft on earth use aerobraking especially for more distant destinations this involves the spacecraft using a fuel burn to change its trajectory so it will pass through a planet or a moons atmosphere drag caused by the spacecraft hitting the atmosphere enables it to slow down without using fuel however this generates very high temperatures and so adds a requirement for a heat shield of some sort space capsules are a type of spacecraft that can return from space at least once they have a blunt shape do not usually contain much more fuel than needed and they do not possess wings unlike spaceplanes they are the simplest form of recoverable spacecraft and so the most commonly used the first such capsule was the vostok capsule built by the soviet union that carried the first person in space yuri gagarin other examples include the soyuz and orion capsules built by the soviet union and nasa respectively spaceplanes are spacecraft that are built in the shape of and function as airplanes the first example of such was the north american x15 spaceplane which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over 100 kilometres 62 mi in the 1960s this first reusable spacecraft was airlaunched on a suborbital trajectory on july 19 1963 the first reusable orbital spaceplane was the space shuttle orbiter the first orbiter to fly in space the space shuttle columbia was launched by the usa on the 20th anniversary of yuri gagarins flight on april 12 1981 during the shuttle era six orbiters were built all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests launching from the back of a boeing 747 sca and gliding to deadstick landings at edwards afb california the first space shuttle to fly into space was columbia followed by challenger discovery atlantis and endeavour endeavour was built to replace challenger when it was lost in january 1986 columbia broke up during reentry in february 2003 the first autonomous reusable spaceplane was the buranclass shuttle launched by the ussr on november 15 1988 although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed this spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the us space shuttle although its dropoff boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the american shuttle lack of funding complicated by the dissolution of the ussr prevented any further flights of buran the space shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous reentry in case of necessity per the vision for space exploration the space shuttle was retired in 2011 mainly due to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight the shuttles human transport role is to be replaced by spacexs spacex dragon 2 and boeings cst100 starliner dragon 2s first crewed flight occurred on may 30 202030 the shuttles heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the space launch system and ulas vulcan rocket as well as the commercial launch vehicles scaled composites spaceshipone was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots mike melvill and brian binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the ansari x prize the spaceship company built a successor spaceshiptwo a fleet of spaceshiptwos operated by virgin galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014 but was delayed after the crash of vss enterprise the space shuttle is a retired reusable low earth orbital launch system it consisted of two reusable solid rocket boosters that landed by parachute were recovered at sea and were the most powerful rocket motors ever made until they were superseded by those of nasas sls rocket with a liftoff thrust of 2800000 poundsforce 12 mn which soon increased to 3300000 poundsforce 15 mn per booster31 and were fueled by a combination of pban and apcp the space shuttle orbiter with 3 rs25 engines that used a liquid oxygenliquid hydrogen propellant combination and the bright orange throwaway space shuttle external tank from which the rs25 engines sourced their fuel the orbiter was a spaceplane that was launched at nasas kennedy space centre and landed mainly at the shuttle landing facility which is part of kennedy space centre a second launch site vandenberg space launch complex 6 in california was revamped so it could be used to launch the shuttles but it was never used the launch system could lift about 29 tonnes 64000 lb into an eastward low earth orbit each orbiter weighed roughly 78 tonnes 172000 lb however the different orbiters had differing weights and thus payloads with columbia being the heaviest orbiter challenger being lighter than columbia but still heavier than the other three the orbiter structure was mostly composed of aluminium alloy the orbiter had seven seats for crew members though on sts61a the launch took place with 8 crew onboard the orbiters had 46 metres 15 ft wide by 18 metres 59 ft long payload bays and also were equipped with a 152 metres 50 ft canadaarm1 an upgraded version of which is used on the international space station the heat shield or thermal protection system of the orbiter used to protect it from extreme levels of heat during atmospheric reentry and the cold of space was made up of different materials depending on weight and how much heating a particular area on the shuttle would receive during reentry which ranged from over 2900 f 1600 c to under 700 f 370 c the orbiter was manually operated though an autonomous landing system was added while the shuttle was still on service it had an in orbit maneouvreing system known as the orbital manoeuvring system which used the hypergolic propellants monomethylhydrazine mmh and dinitrogen tetroxide which was used for orbital insertion changes to orbits and the deorbit burn though the shuttles goals were to drastically decrease launch costs it did not do so ending up being much more expensive than similar expendable launchers this was due to expensive refurbishment costs and the external tank being expended once a landing had occurred the srbs and many parts of the orbiter had to be disassembled for inspection which was long and arduous furthermore the rs25 engines had to be replaced every few flights each of the heat shielding tiles had to go in one specific area on the orbiter increasing complexity more adding to this the shuttle was a rather dangerous system with fragile heat shielding tiles some being so fragile that one could easily scrape it off by hand often having been damaged in many flights after 30 years in service from 1981 to 2011 and 135 flights the shuttle was retired from service due to the cost of maintaining the shuttles and the 3 remaining orbiters the other two were destroyed in accidents were prepared to be displayed in museums some spacecraft do not fit particularly well into any of the general spacecraft categories this is a list of these spacecraft starship is a spacecraft and second stage32 under development by american aerospace company spacex stacked atop its booster super heavy it composes the identically named starship super heavylift space vehicle the spacecraft is designed to transport both crew and cargo to a variety of destinations including earth orbit the moon mars and potentially beyond it is intended to enable long duration interplanetary flights for a crew of up to 100 people32 it will also be capable of pointtopoint transport on earth enabling travel to anywhere in the world in less than an hour furthermore the spacecraft will be used to refuel other starship vehicles to allow them to reach higher orbits to and other space destinations elon musk the ceo of spacex estimated in a tweet that 8 launches would be needed to completely refuel a starship in low earth orbit extrapolating this from starships payload to orbit and how much fuel a fully fueled starship contains33 to land on bodies without an atmosphere such as the moon starship will fire its engines and thrusters to slow down34 the mission extension vehicle is a robotic spacecraft designed to prolong the life on another spacecraft it works by docking to its target spacecraft then correcting its orientation or orbit this also allows it to rescue a satellite which is in the wrong orbit by using its own fuel to move its target to the correct orbit the project is currently managed by northrop grumman innovation systems as of 2023 2 have been launched the first launched on a proton rocket on 9 october 2019 and did a rendezvous with intelsat901 on 25 february 2020 it will remain with the satellite until 2025 before the satellite is moved to a final graveyard orbit and the vehicle does a rendezvous with another satellite the other one launched on an ariane 5 rocket on 15 august 2020 a spacecraft astrionics system comprises different subsystems depending on the mission profile spacecraft subsystems are mounted in the satellite bus and may include attitude determination and control variously called adac adc or acs guidance navigation and control gnc or gnc communications comms command and data handling cdh or cdh power eps thermal control tcs propulsion and structures attached to the bus are typically payloads
