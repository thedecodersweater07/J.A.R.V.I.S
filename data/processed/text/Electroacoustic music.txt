electroacoustic music is a genre of western art music in which composers use recording technology and audio signal processing to manipulate the timbres of acoustic sounds in the creation of pieces of music1 it originated around the middle of the 20th century following the incorporation of electronic sound production into formal compositional practice the initial developments in electroacoustic music composition to fixed media during the 20th century are associated with the activities of the groupe de recherches musicales fr at the ortf in paris the home of musique concrte the studio for electronic music in cologne where the focus was on the composition of elektronische musik and the columbiaprinceton electronic music center in new york city where tape music electronic music and computer music were all explored practical electronic music instruments began to appear in the early 20th century tape music is an integral part of musique concrte which uses the tape recorder as its central musical source the music can utilise prerecorded sound fragments and the creation of loops which can be altered and manipulated through techniques such as editing and playback speed manipulation2 the work of halim eldabh is perhaps the earliest example of tape or in this case wire recording music eldabhs the expression of zaar first presented in cairo egypt in 1944 was an early work using musique concrtelike techniques similar to those developed in paris during the same period eldabh would later become more famous for his work at the columbiaprinceton electronic music center where in 1959 he composed the influential piece leiyla and the poet3 composer john cages assembly of the williams mix serves as an example of the rigors of tape music first cage created a 192page score over the course of a year 600 sounds were assembled and recorded cut tape segments for each occurrence of each sound were accumulated on the score then the cut segments were spliced to one of eight tapes work finished on january 16 1953 the premiere performance realization of the 415 work was given on march 21 1953 at the university of illinois urbana4 in cologne elektronische musik pioneered in 194951 by the composer herbert eimert and the physicist werner meyereppler was based solely on electronically generated synthetic sounds particularly sine waves567 the beginning of the development of electronic music has been traced back to the invention of the valve vacuum tube in 19065 the precise control afforded by the studio allowed for what eimert considered to be the subjection of everything to the last element of the single note to serial permutation resulting in a completely new way of composing sound8 in the studio serial operations could be applied to elements such as timbre and dynamics the common link between the two schools is that the music is recorded and performed through loudspeakers without a human performer the majority of electroacoustic pieces use a combination of recorded sound and synthesized or processed sounds and the schism between schaeffers and eimerts approaches has been overcome the first major example being karlheinz stockhausens gesang der jnglinge of 195556910 circuit bending is the creative shortcircuiting of low voltage batterypowered electronic audio devices such as guitar effects childrens toys and small synthesizers to create new musical instruments and sound generators emphasizing spontaneity and randomness the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with bent instruments11 important centers of research and composition can be found around the world and there are numerous conferences and festivals which present electroacoustic music notably the international computer music conference the international conference on new interfaces for musical expression the electroacoustic music studies conference and the ars electronica festival linz austria a number of national associations promote the art form notably the canadian electroacoustic community cec in canada the society for electroacoustic music in the united states seamus in the us the australasian computer music association in australia and new zealand and sound and music previously the sonic arts network in the uk the computer music journal and organised sound are the two most important peerreviewed journals dedicated to electroacoustic studies while several national associations produce print and electronic publications there have been a number of festivals that feature electroacoustic music early festivals such as donaueschingen festival founded in 1921 were some of the first to include electroacoustic instruments and pieces this was followed by once festival of new music in the 1950s and since the 1960s there has been a growth of festivals that focus exclusively on electroacoustic music alongside paper presentations workshops and seminars many of these events also feature concert performances or sound installations created by those attending or which are related to the theme of the conference symposium
