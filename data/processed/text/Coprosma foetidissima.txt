coprosma foetidissima commonly known as stinkwood or hpiro mori is a species of flowering plant in the family rubiaceae native to mainland new zealand as well as stewart island and the auckland islands it grows as a shrub or small tree and is found in coastal to subalpine forest and shrubland its distinctive characteristic is the unpleasant rotten cabbage smell produced when its leaves are crushed coprosma foetidissima is in the family rubiaceae and was described in 1776 by johann reinhold forster and georg forster2 the species is named stinkwood and foetidissima because of the foul smell produced when the leaves are crushed3 during the second voyage of james cook johann forster reported that the plant gave off a smell like rotten cabbage4 the smell is caused by the sulphur compound methanethiol or methyl mercaptan56 the name for the genus coprosma is derived from this species4 in greek copros means dung and osma means smell however despite this species being the basis of the name for the entire genus most of the other species in the genus do not smell in this way4 the specific epithet foetidissima is derived from latin where foetidus means stinking or badsmelling the name of the species in the mori language is hpiro78 in his report on a botanical survey of the auckland islands as part of the antarctic voyages of hms erebus from 18391843 joseph dalton hooker recalled collecting a specimen of c foetidissima9 the whole plant especially when bruised or when drying exhales an exceedingly fetid odour much resembling that of the flowers of hibbertia volubilis i brought on board the erebus specimens of this with the other plants late one evening and finding that there were more tender species which took a considerable time to lay in paper than i could well get through that night i locked this coprosma in a small close cabin until i should have leisure to press it but before half an hour had elapsed the smell was intolerable and had pervaded the whole of the lower deck the type specimen recorded by georg forster in 1772 is held in the vascular plants collection of the university of gettingen10 c foetidissima grows as a small open branched tree or shrub11 typically up to 3 m 98 ft tall but in the auckland islands can reach a height of 6 m 20 ft with a trunk up to 45 cm 18 in in diameter49 the bark is dark brown and the branchlets are without hairs glabrous stipules are shorter than typical for coprosma species and taper to a mostly conspicuous long toothlike growth covered in fine short hairs with tufts of unequal hairs at the tips leaves are thin 3050 mm long 1420 mm wide somewhat leathery textured shaped obovate to oblong to broadly ovate leaf tip may vary from rounded to having a small tapered point12 the leaves lie in a single plane on the branchlet4 the leaves of c foetidissima have domatia small indentations on the underside that may be occupied by potentially beneficial insects such as mites and other arthropods13 c foetidissima is dioecious meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate plants14 flowering occurs between october and november12 the flowers are solitary and occur on the ends of branchlets11 male flowers calyx cuplike 4 or 5toothed corolla bellshaped 4 or 8 lobed to the middle anthers are large elongated oblong in form and as long as the corolla female flowers the calyxtube is short and narrowly ovoid tubular and toothed corolla is a curved tube with 4 or 5 splits extending one third to half way down styles are substantial and long15 fruiting occurs between march and july the drupes are 710 mm 028039 in in length with an oblong shape12 they are yellow to orangered in colour4 and are dispersed by frugivory12 c foetidissima is endemic to new zealand12 and found southwards from the coromandel peninsula to stewart island and on the auckland islands41116 it grows in coastal to subalpine forest and shrubland1412 a wide range of endemic insects feed on c foetidissima including three species of gall mites in the family eriophyidae five species of caterpillars of moths or butterflies in the families gracillariidae tortricidae and geometridae eight species of scale insects and sucking bugs in the families aleyrodidae eriococcidae diaspididae and miridae and larvae of one species of gall fly in the family cecidomyiidae seven species of weevil in the family curculionidae live in dead wood the wellington tree wt hemideina crassidens has also been observed feeding on leaves17 c foetidissima was listed as not threatened in the 2023 new zealand threat classification series for vascular plants1 it is listed as least concern in the 2025 iucn red list of threatened species18 media related to coprosma foetidissima at wikimedia commons data related to coprosma foetidissima at wikispecies
