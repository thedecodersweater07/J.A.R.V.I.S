herbert george wells 21 september 1866 13 august 1946 was an english writer prolific in many genres he wrote more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories his nonfiction output included works of social commentary politics history popular science satire biography and autobiography wells is most known today for his groundbreaking science fiction novels he has been called the father of science fiction12 in addition to his fame as a writer he was prominent in his lifetime as a forwardlooking even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale as a futurist he wrote a number of utopian works3 and foresaw the advent of aircraft tanks space travel nuclear weapons satellite television and something resembling the world wide web45 his science fiction imagined time travel alien invasion invisibility and biological engineering before these subjects were common in the genre4 brian aldiss referred to wells as the shakespeare of science fiction while charles fort called him a wild talent6 7 7 wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work dubbed wellss law leading joseph conrad to hail him in 1898 with o realist of the fantastic8 his most notable science fiction works include the time machine 1895 which was his first novella the island of doctor moreau 1896 the invisible man 1897 the war of the worlds 1898 the military science fiction the war in the air 1907 and the dystopian when the sleeper wakes 1910 novels of social realism such as kipps 1905 and the history of mr polly 1910 which describe lowermiddleclass english life led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to charles dickens9 99 but wells described a range of social strata and even attempted in tonobungay 1909 a diagnosis of english society as a whole wells was nominated for the nobel prize in literature four times10 wellss earliest specialised training was in biology and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a darwinian context11 he was also an outspoken socialist from a young age often but not always as at the beginning of the first world war sympathising with pacifist views1213 in his later years he wrote less fiction and more works expounding his political and social views sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist9 wells was a diabetic and cofounded the charity the diabetic association diabetes uk in 193414 herbert george wells was born at atlas house 162 high street in bromley kent15 on 21 september 186616 called bertie by his family he was the fourth and last child of joseph wells a former domestic gardener and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and sarah neal a former domestic servant an inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods although it failed to prosper in part because the stock was old and worn out and the location was poor joseph wells managed to earn a meagre income but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the kent county team17 a defining incident of young wellss life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg16 to pass the time he began to read books from the local library brought to him by his father he soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access they also stimulated his desire to write later that year he entered thomas morleys commercial academy a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of morleys earlier school the teaching was erratic and the curriculum mostly focused wells later said on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen wells continued at morleys academy until 1880 in 1877 his father joseph wells fractured his femur the accident effectively put an end to josephs career as a cricketer and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income18 no longer able to support themselves financially the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations20 from 1880 to 1883 wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at hydes drapery emporium in southsea21 his experiences at hydes where he worked a thirteenhour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices15 later inspired his novels the wheels of chance the history of mr polly and kipps which portray the life of a drapers apprentice as well as providing a critique of societys distribution of wealth22 2 wellss parents had a turbulent marriage owing primarily to his mother being a protestant and his father being a freethinker when his mother returned to work as a ladys maid at uppark a country house in west sussex one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children thereafter she and joseph lived separate lives though they remained faithful to each other and never divorced as a consequence herberts personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also later as a chemists assistant however uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself reading many classic works including platos republic thomas mores utopia and the works of daniel defoe23 when he became the first doyen of science fiction as a distinct genre of fiction wells referenced mary shelleys frankenstein in relation to his works writing they belong to a class of writing which includes the story of frankenstein24 in october 1879 wellss mother arranged through a distant relative arthur williams for him to join the national school at wookey in somerset as a pupilteacher a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children21 in december that year however williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and wells was returned to uppark after a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at midhurst grammar school he signed his apprenticeship papers at hydes in 1883 wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship taking an opportunity offered by midhurst grammar school again to become a pupilteacher his proficiency in latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered1721 the years he spent in southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point but his good fortune in securing a position at midhurst grammar school meant that wells could continue his selfeducation in earnest17 the following year wells won a scholarship to the normal school of science later the royal college of science in south kensington which became part of imperial college london in london studying biology under thomas henry huxley22 164 as an alumnus he later helped to set up the royal college of science association of which he became the first president in 1909 wells studied in his new school until 1887 with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings a guinea thanks to his scholarship this ought to have been a comfortable sum of money at the time many working class families had round about a pound a week as their entire household income25 yet in his experiment in autobiography wells speaks of constantly being hungry and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished26 he soon entered the debating society of the school these years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society at first approaching the subject through platos republic he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed fabian society and free lectures delivered at kelmscott house the home of william morris he was also among the founders of the science school journal a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society as well as trying his hand at fiction a precursor to his novel the time machine was published in the journal under the title the chronic argonauts the school year 188687 was the last year of his studies22 164 during 1888 wells stayed in stokeontrent living in basford the unique environment of the potteries was certainly an inspiration he wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that the district made an immense impression on me the inspiration for some of his descriptions in the war of the worlds is thought to have come from his short time spent here seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city shooting huge red light into the skies his stay in the potteries also resulted in the macabre short story the cone 1895 contemporaneous with his famous the time machine set in the north of the city27 90 after teaching for some timehe was briefly on the staff of holt academy in wales28wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the college of preceptors college of teachers he later received his licentiate and fellowship fcp diplomas from the college it was not until 1890 that wells earned a bachelor of science degree in zoology from the university of london external programme in 188990 he managed to find a post as a teacher at henley house school in london where he taught a a milne whose father ran the school2930 his first published work was a textbook of biology in two volumes 189331 upon leaving the normal school of science wells was left without a source of income his aunt maryhis fathers sisterinlawinvited him to stay with her for a while which solved his immediate problem of accommodation during his stay at his aunts he grew increasingly interested in her daughter isabel whom he later courted and married to earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as the pall mall gazette later collecting these in select conversations with an uncle 1895 and certain personal matters 1897 so prolific did wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified according to david c smith most of wellss occasional pieces have not been collected and many have not even been identified as his wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so as a result many of his early pieces are unknown it is obvious that many early wells items have been lost32 his success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write booklength work and he published his first novel the time machine in 189533 in 1891 wells married his cousin isabel mary wells 18651931 from 1902 isabel mary smith35 the couple agreed to separate in 1894 when he had fallen in love with one of his students amy catherine robbins 18721927 later known as jane with whom he moved to woking surrey in may 1895 they lived in a rented house lynton now no 141 maybury road in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at st pancras register office in october 18953622 165 his short period in woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career while there he planned and wrote the war of the worlds and the time machine completed the island of doctor moreau wrote and published the wonderful visit and the wheels of chance and began writing two other early books when the sleeper wakes and love and mr lewisham3637 in late summer 1896 wells and jane moved to a larger house in worcester park near kingston upon thames for two years this lasted until his poor health took them to sandgate near folkestone where he constructed a large family home spade house in 1901 he had two sons with jane george philip known as gip 19011985 and frank richard 190319826 295 grandfather of film director simon wells jane died on 6 october 1927 in dunmow at the age of 55 which left wells devastated she was cremated at golders green with friends of the couple present including george bernard shaw27 64 wells had multiple love affairs38 dorothy richardson was a friend with whom he had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and miscarriage in 1907 wellss wife had been a schoolmate of richardson39 in december 1909 he had a daughter annajane with the writer amber reeves40 whose parents william and maud pember reeves he had met through the fabian society amber had married the barrister g r blanco white in july of that year as coarranged by wells after beatrice webb voiced disapproval of wellss sordid intrigue with amber he responded by lampooning beatrice webb and her husband sidney webb in his 1911 novel the new machiavelli as altiora and oscar bailey a pair of shortsighted bourgeois manipulators between 1910 and 1913 novelist elizabeth von arnim was one of his mistresses41 in 1914 he had a son anthony west 19141987 by the novelist and feminist rebecca west 26 years his junior42 in 192021 and intermittently until his death he had a love affair with the american birth control activist margaret sanger43 between 1924 and 1933 he partnered with the 22yearyounger dutch adventurer and writer odette keun with whom he lived in lou pidou a house they built together in grasse france wells dedicated his longest book to her the world of william clissold 192644 when visiting maxim gorky in russia 1920 he had slept with gorkys mistress moura budberg45 then still countess benckendorf and 27 years his junior in 1933 when she left gorky and emigrated to london their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness wells repeatedly asked her to marry him but budberg strongly rejected his proposals4647 in experiment in autobiography 1934 wells wrote i was never a great amorist though i have loved several people very deeply48 david lodges novel a man of parts 2011 a narrative based on factual sources authors note gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of wellss relations with the women mentioned above and others49 one of the ways that wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches one common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries and they covered a wide variety of topics from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests during his marriage to amy catherine whom he nicknamed jane he drew a considerable number of pictures many of them being overt comments on their marriage during this period he called these pictures picshuas50 these picshuas have been the topic of study by wells scholars for many years and in 2006 a book was published on the subject51 some of his early novels called scientific romances invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as the time machine the island of doctor moreau the invisible man the war of the worlds when the sleeper wakes and the first men in the moon he also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim including kipps and a critique of english culture during the edwardian period tonobungay wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas including the flowering of the strange orchid which helped bring the full impact of darwins revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public and was followed by many later successes such as the country of the blind 190452 writer james e gunn contended that one of wellss major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach referring to it as his new system of ideas53 gunn opined that an author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen today referred to as the plausible impossible and suspension of disbelief while neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with he conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time54 the term time machine coined by wells is almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle23 he explained that while writing the time machine he realized that the more impossible the story i had to tell the more ordinary must be the setting and the circumstances in which i now set the time traveller were all that i could imagine of solid upperclass comforts55 in wellss law a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption therefore as justifications for the impossible he employed scientific ideas and theories wellss bestknown statement of the law appears in his introduction to a collection of his works published in 1934 as soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention5657 dr griffin the invisible man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility but finds himself unable to reverse the process an enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction58 the island of doctor moreau sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of doctor moreau a mad scientist who creates humanlike hybrid beings from animals via vivisection59 the earliest depiction of uplift the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes including pain and cruelty moral responsibility human identity and human interference with nature60 in the first men in the moon wells used the idea of radio communication between astronomical objects a plot point inspired by nikola teslas claim that he had received radio signals from mars61 in addition to science fiction wells produced work dealing with mythological beings like an angel in the wonderful visit 1895 and a mermaid in the sea lady 190262 though tonobungay is not a sciencefiction novel radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it radioactive decay plays a much larger role in the world set free 1914 a book dedicated to frederick soddy who would receive a nobel for proving the existence of radioactive isotopes63 this book contains what is surely wellss biggest prophetic hit with the first description of a nuclear weapon which he termed atomic bombs6364 scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years the rate of release is too slow to have practical utility but the total amount released is huge wellss novel revolves around an unspecified invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosivesbut which continue to explode for days on end nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible but they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands64 in 1932 the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction le szilrd read the world set free the same year sir james chadwick discovered the neutron a book which he wrote in his memoirs had made a very great impression on me65 in 1934 szilrd took his ideas for a chain reaction to the british war office and later the admiralty assigning his patent to the admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community he wrote knowing what this a chain reaction would meanand i knew it because i had read h g wellsi did not want this patent to become public63 wells also wrote nonfiction his first nonfiction bestseller was anticipations of the reaction of mechanical and scientific progress upon human life and thought 1901 when originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled an experiment in prophecy and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work it offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able rather than the traditional upper classes as leaders anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000 the book is interesting both for its hits trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom the defeat of german militarism and the existence of a european union and its misses he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950 and averred that my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea6667 his bestselling twovolume work the outline of history 1920 began a new era of popularised world history it received a mixed critical response from professional historians68 however it was very popular amongst the general population and made wells a rich man many other authors followed with outlines of their own in other subjects he reprised his outline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work a short history of the world a history book praised by albert einstein69 and two long efforts the science of life 1930written with his son g p wells and evolutionary biologist julian huxley and the work wealth and happiness of mankind 19317071 the outlines became sufficiently common for james thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay an outline of scientistsindeed wellss outline of history remains in print with a new 2005 edition while a short history of the world has been reedited 200672 from quite early in wellss career he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of utopian novels3 the first of these was a modern utopia 1905 which shows a worldwide utopia with no imports but meteorites and no exports at all73 two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history the others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe until people realise a better way of living whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a european war in the days of the comet 1906 or a world council of scientists taking over as in the shape of things to come 1933 which he later adapted for the 1936 alexander korda film things to come this depicted all too accurately the impending world war with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs he also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in the autocracy of mr parham 1930 and the holy terror 1939 men like gods 1923 is also a utopian novel wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure the literary critic malcolm cowley stated by the time he was forty his influence was wider than any other living english writer74 wells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as the first men in the moon where nature is completely suppressed by nurture and the island of doctor moreau where the strong presence of nature represents a threat to a civilized society not all his scientific romances ended in a utopia and wells also wrote a dystopian novel when the sleeper wakes 1899 rewritten as the sleeper awakes 1910 which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers75 the island of doctor moreau is even darker the narrator having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected unsuccessfully into human beings eventually returns to england like gulliver on his return from the houyhnhnms he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts slowly reverting to their animal natures76 wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of w n p barbellions diaries the journal of a disappointed man published in 1919 since barbellion was the real authors pen name many reviewers believed wells to have been the true author of the journal wells always denied this despite being full of praise for the diaries77 in 1927 a canadian teacher and writer florence deeks unsuccessfully sued wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust claiming that much of the outline of history had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript78 the web of the worlds romance which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of wellss canadian publisher macmillan canada79 however it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in toronto in the safekeeping of macmillan and that wells did not even know it existed let alone seen it80 the court found no proof of copying and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources81 the case went on appeal from the canadian courts to the judicial committee of the privy council at that time the highest court of appeal for the british empire which dismissed the appeal in deeks v wells82 in 2000 a b mckillop a professor of history at carleton university produced a book on the case the spinster the prophet florence deeks h g wells and the mystery of the purloined past83 according to mckillop the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a wellknown and famous male author and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case84 in 2004 denis n magnusson professor emeritus of the faculty of law queens university ontario published an article on deeks v wells this reexamines the case in relation to mckillops book while having some sympathy for deeks he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers she received a fair trial adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today ie 200485 in 1933 wells predicted in the shape of things to come that the world war he feared would begin in january 194086 a prediction which ultimately came true four months early in september 1939 with the outbreak of world war ii6 209 in 1936 before the royal institution wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing world encyclopaedia to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being he also presented on his conception of a world encyclopedia at the world congress of universal documentation in paris in 193787 in 1938 he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education world brain including the essay the idea of a permanent world encyclopaedia88 prior to 1933 wellss books were widely read in germany and austria and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication89 by 1933 he had attracted the attention of german officials because of his criticism of the political situation in germany and on 10 may 1933 wellss books were burned by the nazi youth in berlins opernplatz and his works were banned from libraries and book stores89 wells as president of pen international poets essayists novelists angered the nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the german pen club from the international body in 1934 following the german pens refusal to admit nonaryan writers to its membership at a pen conference in ragusa wells refused to yield to nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author ernst toller be prevented from speaking89 near the end of world war ii allied forces discovered that the ss had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of britain in the abandoned operation sea lion with wells included in the alphabetical list of the black book90 seeking a more structured way to play war games wells wrote floor games 1911 followed by little wars 1913 which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers miniatures91 a pacifist prior to the first world war wells stated how much better is this amiable miniature war than the real thing91 according to wells the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend jerome k jerome after dinner jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and wells joined in to compete91 during august 1914 immediately after the outbreak of the first world war wells published a number of articles in london newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled the war that will end war6 147 92 he coined the expression with the idealistic belief that the result of the war would make a future conflict impossible93 wells blamed the central powers for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of german militarism could bring about an end to war94 wells used the shorter form of the phrase the war to end war in in the fourth year 1918 in which he noted that the phrase got into circulation in the second half of 191495 in fact it had become one of the most common catchphrases of the war94 in 1918 wells worked for the british war propaganda bureau also called wellington house96 wells was also one of fiftythree leading british authors a number that included rudyard kipling thomas hardy and sir arthur conan doyle who signed their names to the authors declaration this manifesto declared that the german invasion of belgium had been a brutal crime and that britain could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war96 wells visited russia three times 1914 1920 and 1934 after his visits to petrograd and moscow in january 1914 he came back to england a staunch russophile his views were recorded in a newspaper article russia and england a study on contrasts published in the daily news on 1 february 1941 and in his novel joan and peter 191897 during his second visit he saw his old friend maxim gorky and with gorkys help met vladimir lenin in his book russia in the shadows wells portrayed russia as recovering from a total social collapse the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation98 on 23 july 1934 after visiting us president franklin d roosevelt wells went to the soviet union and interviewed joseph stalin for three hours for the new statesman magazine which was extremely rare at that time he told stalin how he had seen the happy faces of healthy people in contrast with his previous visit to moscow in 192099 however he also criticised the lawlessness class discrimination state violence and absence of free expression stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly as the chairman of the londonbased pen international which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated wells hoped by his trip to ussr he could win stalin over by force of argument before he left he realised that no reform was to happen in the near future100101 wellss greatest literary output occurred before the first world war which was lamented by younger authors whom he had influenced in this connection george orwell described wells as too sane to understand the modern world and since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons102 g k chesterton quipped mr wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message103 wells had diabetes104 and was a cofounder in 1934 of the diabetic association now diabetes uk the leading charity for people with diabetes in the uk105 on 28 october 1940 on the radio station ktsa in san antonio texas wells took part in a radio interview with orson welles who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of the war of the worlds during the interview by charles c shaw a ktsa radio host wells admitted his surprise at the sensation that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to welles for increasing sales of one of his more obscure titles106 wells died on 13 august 1946 aged 79 at his home at 13 hanover terrace overlooking regents park london10716 in his preface to the 1941 edition of the war in the air wells had stated that his epitaph should be i told you so you damned fools108 wellss body was cremated at golders green crematorium on 16 august 1946 his ashes were subsequently scattered into the english channel at old harry rocks the most eastern point of the jurassic coast and about 35 miles 56 km from swanage in dorset109 a commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed by the greater london council at his home in regents park in 1966110 a futurist and visionary wells foresaw the advent of aircraft tanks space travel nuclear weapons satellite television and something resembling the world wide web5 asserting that wellss visions of the future remain unsurpassed john higgs author of stranger than we can imagine making sense of the twentieth century states that in the late 19th century wells saw the coming century clearer than anyone else he anticipated wars in the air the sexual revolution motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a protowikipedia he called the world brain in his novel the world set free he imagined an atomic bomb of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes this was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913 and it made a deep impression on winston churchill111 many readers have hailed h g wells and george orwell as special kinds of writers ones endowed with remarkable prescriptive and prophetic powers wells was the twentiethcentury prototype of this literary vatic figure he invented the role explored its possibilities especially through new forms of prose and new ways to publish and defined its boundaries his impact on his culture was profound as george orwell wrote the minds of all of us and therefore the physical world would be perceptibly different if wells had never existed the author as cultural hero h g wells and george orwell112 in 2011 wells was among a group of science fiction writers featured in the prophets of science fiction series a show produced and hosted by film director sir ridley scott which depicts how predictions influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality113 in a 2013 review of the time machine for the new yorker magazine brad leithauser writes at the base of wellss great visionary exploit is this rational ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditionsnot as they might arise in a few years or even decades but millennia hence epochs hence he is world literatures great extrapolator like no other fiction writer before him he embraced deep time114 wells was a socialist and a member of the fabian society117 he stood as a labour party candidate for london university in the 1922 and 1923 general elections118 winston churchill was an avid reader of wellss books after they first met in 1902 they kept in touch until wells died in 1946115 as a junior minister churchill borrowed lines from wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906 as prime minister the phrase the gathering stormused by churchill to describe the rise of nazi germanyhad been written by wells in the war of the worlds which depicts an attack on britain by martians115 wellss extensive writings on equality and human rights most notably his most influential work the rights of man 1940 laid the groundwork for the 1948 universal declaration of human rights which was adopted by the united nations shortly after his death119 his efforts regarding the league of nations on which he collaborated on the project with leonard woolf with the booklets the idea of a league of nations prolegomena to the study of world organization and the way of the league of nations became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the second world war which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature120 in his last book mind at the end of its tether 1945 he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea he referred to the era between the two world wars as the age of frustration121 wells was initially an opponent of zionism in in the days of the comet jews are described as parasites on european society however wells later became a strong supporter of the establishment of a jewish state in response to the holocaust122 he was a member of the other club a london dining club wellss views on god and religion changed over his lifetime early in his life he distanced himself from christianity and later from theism finally late in life he was essentially atheistic martin gardner summarises this progression the younger wells did not object to using the word god provided it did not imply anything resembling human personality in his middle years wells went through a phase of defending the concept of a finite god similar to the god of such process theologians as samuel alexander edgar brightman and charles hartshorne he even wrote a book about it called god the invisible king later wells decided he was really an atheist123 in god the invisible king 1917 wells wrote that his idea of god did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world this book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer which is a profound belief in a personal and intimate god putting the leading idea of this book very roughly these two antagonistic typical conceptions of god may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as godasnature or the creator and of the other as godaschrist or the redeemer one is the great outward god the other is the inmost god the first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the god of spinoza it is a conception of god tending to pantheism to an idea of a comprehensive god as ruling with justice rather than affection to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness the second idea which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute god is the god of the human heart the writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced christianity was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of god into one focus124 later in the work he aligns himself with a renascent or modern religion neither atheist nor buddhist nor mohammedan nor christian that he has found growing up in himself125 of christianity he said it is not now true for me every believing christian is i am sure my spiritual brother but if systemically i called myself a christian i feel that to most men i should imply too much and so tell a lie of other world religions he writes all these religions are true for me as canterbury cathedral is a true thing and as a swiss chalet is a true thing there they are and they have served a purpose they have worked only they are not true for me to live in them they do not work for me126 in the fate of homo sapiens 1939 wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies stating there is no creed no way of living left in the world at all that really meets the needs of the time when we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately all the main religions patriotic moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast sprawling city overtaken by a landslide127 wellss opposition to organised religion reached a fever pitch in 1943 with publication of his book crux ansata subtitled an indictment of the roman catholic church in which he attacked catholicism pope pius xii and called for the bombing of the city of rome128 the science fiction historian john clute describes wells as the most important writer the genre has yet seen and notes his work has been central to both british and american science fiction129 science fiction author and critic algis budrys said wells remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope and the despair which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world130 he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature in 1921 1932 1935 and 194610 wells so influenced real exploration of space that impact craters on mars and the moon were named after him131 wellss genius was his ability to create a stream of brand new wholly original stories out of thin air originality was wellss calling card in a sixyear stretch from 1895 to 1901 he produced a stream of what he called scientific romance novels which included the time machine the island of doctor moreau the invisible man the war of the worlds and the first men in the moon this was a dazzling display of new thought endlessly copied since a book like the war of the worlds inspired every one of the thousands of alien invasion stories that followed it burned its way into the psyche of mankind and changed us all forever cultural historian john higgs the guardian111 in the united kingdom wellss work was a key model for the british scientific romance and other writers in that mode such as olaf stapledon132 j d beresford133 s fowler wright134 and naomi mitchison135 all drew on wellss example wells was also an important influence on british science fiction of the period after the second world war with arthur c clarke136 and brian aldiss137 expressing strong admiration for wellss work a selfdeclared fan of wells john wyndham author of the day of the triffids and the midwich cuckoos echoes wellss obsession with catastrophe and its aftermath138 his early work pre 1920 made wells the literary hero of dystopian novelist george orwell139 among contemporary british science fiction writers stephen baxter christopher priest and adam roberts have all acknowledged wellss influence on their writing all three are vicepresidents of the h g wells society he also had a strong influence on british scientist j b s haldane who wrote daedalus or science and the future 1924 the last judgement and on being the right size from the essay collection possible worlds 1927 and biological possibilities for the human species in the next ten thousand years 1963 which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers140141 in the united states hugo gernsback reprinted most of wellss work in the pulp magazine amazing stories regarding wellss work as texts of central importance to the selfconscious new genre129 later american writers such as ray bradbury142 isaac asimov143 frank herbert144 carl sagan131 and ursula k le guin145 all recalled being influenced by wells sinclair lewiss early novels were strongly influenced by wellss realistic social novels such as the history of mr polly lewis also named his first son wells after the author146 lewis nominated h g wells for the nobel prize in literature in 193210 in an interview with the paris review vladimir nabokov described wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and a great artist147 he went on to cite the passionate friends ann veronica the time machine and the country of the blind as superior to anything else written by wellss british contemporaries nabokov said his sociological cogitations can be safely ignored of course but his romances and fantasies are superb147 jorge luis borges wrote many short pieces on wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of wellss work148 while borges wrote several critical reviews including a mostly negative review of wellss film things to come149 he regularly treated wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature late in his life borges included the invisible man and the time machine in his prologue to a personal library150 a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the argentine publishing house emec wells also inspired writers of continental european speculative fiction such as karel apek145 mikhail bulgakov151 and yevgeny zamyatin145 in 2021 wells was one of six british writers commemorated on a series of uk postage stamps issued by royal mail to celebrate british science fiction152 six classic science fiction novels were depicted one from each author with the time machine chosen to represent wells152 the novels and short stories of h g wells have been adapted for cinema these include island of lost souls 1932 the invisible man 1933 things to come 1936 the man who could work miracles 1937 the war of the worlds 1953 the time machine 1960 first men in the moon 1964 the island of dr moreau 1977 time after time 1979 the island
