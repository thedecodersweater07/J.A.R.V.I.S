a 62 magnitude earthquake occurred in afghanistan on october 22 2009 at 195127 utc the maximum mercalli intensity was v moderate at fayzabad badakhshan the ongoing continental collision between the indian plate and eurasian plate results in tectonic uplift forming the himalaya hindu kush and pamir mountains the two plates collide along a convergent plate boundary which includes the main himalayan thrust broad crustal deformation caused by the indian plate ploughing into eurasia causes uplift within the interior of asia this action created the tibetan plateau shallow earthquakes occur on faults that accommodate the tectonic stresses caused by the collision some of the largest earthquakes have exceeded magnitude 80 while even moderately large 60 events have resulted in thousands of fatalities most of these earthquakes are associated with reverse thrust or strikeslip faulting large earthquakes with magnitudes of up to 75 have occurred in the region with an average recurrence interval of 15 years these earthquakes correspond to reverse faulting at a depth of 170 to 280 km1 these earthquakes rather than occurring at a plate boundary are sourced from within the indian plate as it dives beneath the hindu kush as the tectonic slab of the indian plate descends at a nearvertical angle into the mantle it stretches and begins to tear eventually leading to a slab detachment2 this action results in stress accommodation along faults that produces earthquakes when ruptured this was a relatively deep shock with a reverse focal mechanism3 the quake was widely felt in both pakistan and afghanistan it was felt in areas such as karachi kabul and islamabad4 landslides killed three people and two others suffered fatal heart attacks in mirpur pakistan3 this article about an earthquake in asia is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it this afghanistanrelated article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it
