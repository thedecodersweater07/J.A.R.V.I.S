province following the partition of british india it became part of pakistan in 1947 peshawar is a major cultural political and economic centre of the region during the colonial period and well into the early years after independence the lingua franca of peshawar was hindko16 in the succeeding decades the rapid urbanization and the high rate of migration from the rural and tribal areas of the province as well as the influx of afghan refugees following the sovietafghan war transformed peshawar from hindko to a pashtospeaking city171618 today peshawar is largely populated by pashtuns although the original urban population known as peshoris still has a significant presence in the central areas of the old walled city191820 the modern name of the city peshawar is possibly derived from the reconstructed sanskrit word purushapura sanskrit puruapura meaning city of men or city of purusha212223 it was named so by mughal emperor akbar from its old name parashawar the meaning of which akbar did not understand2425 the ruler of the city during its founding may have been a hindu raja named purush the word pur means city in sanskrit262728 sanskrit written in the kharosthi script was the literary language along with gandhari prakrit employed by the buddhist kingdoms which ruled over the area during its earliest recorded period29 the citys name may also be derived from the sanskrit name for city of flowers poshapura a name found in an ancient kharosthi inscription that may refer to peshawar30 chinese buddhist monk xuanzangs seventhcentury account of a city in gandhara called the city polashapulo chinese blshbl and an earlier fifthcentury account by faxian records the citys name as foulousha chinese flush the chinese equivalent of the sanskrit name of the city purushapura3132 an ancient inscription from the shapur era identifies a city in the gandhara valley by the name pskbvr which may be a reference to peshawar33 the arab historian and geographer almasudi noted that by the midtenth century the city was known as parashwar the name was noted to be purshawar and purushavar by albiruni34 the city began to be known as peshwar by the era of emperor akbar35 the current name is said by some to have been based upon the persian word for frontier town35 or more literally forward city though transcription errors and linguistic shifts may account for the citys new name one theory suggests that the citys name is derived from the persian name pesh awardan meaning place of first arrival or frontier city as peshawar was the first city in the indian subcontinent after crossing the khyber pass3637 akbars bibliographer abulfazl ibn mubarak lists the citys name as both parashwar transcribed in persian as 38 and peshwar 39 peshawar was established as the city of puruapura214041 on the gandhara plains in the broad valley of peshawar after the 100 ce4243 it may have been named after a hindu raja who ruled the city who was known as purush26 the city likely first

valley of peshawar during his invasion of the indus valley47 as well as the nearby swat and buner valleys48 following alexanders conquest the valley of peshawar came under the suzerainty of seleucus i nicator founder of the seleucid empire a locally made vase fragment that was found in peshawar depicts a scene from sophocles play antigone49 following the seleucidmauryan war the region was ceded to the mauryan empire in 303 bce51 around 300 bce the greek diplomat and historian megasthenes noted that purushapura was the western terminus of a mauryan road that connected the city to the empires capital at pataliputra near the city of patna in the modernday indian state of bihar5152 as mauryan power declined the grecobactrian kingdom based in modern afghanistan declared its independence from the seleucid empire and quickly seized the region around 190 bce50 the city was then captured by gondophares founder of the indoparthian kingdom gondophares established the nearby takhtibahi monastery in 46 ce50 in the first century ce purushapura came under control of kujula kadphises founder of the kushan empire53 it was made the empires winter capital54 the kushans summer capital at kapisi modern bagram afghanistan55 was seen as the secondary capital of the empire54 while puruapura was considered to be the empires primary capital54 ancient peshawars population was estimated to be 120000 which would make it the seventhmost populous city in the world at the time5644 as a devout buddhist the emperor built the grand kanishka mahavihara monastery57 after his death the magnificent kanishka stupa was built in peshawar to house buddhist relics the golden age of kushan empire in peshawar ended in 232 ce with the death of the last great kushan king vasudeva i around 260 ce the armies of the sasanid emperor shapur i launched an attack against peshawar58 and severely damaged buddhist monuments and monasteries throughout the valley of peshawar44 shapurs campaign also resulted in damage to the citys monumental stupa and monastery44 the kushans were made subordinate to the sasanids and their power rapidly dwindled59 as the sasanids blocked lucrative trade routes westward out of the city44 kushan emperor kanishka iii was able to temporarily reestablish control over the entire valley of peshawar after shapurs invasion44 but the city was then captured by the central asian kidarite kingdom in the early 400s ce60 the white huns devastated ancient peshawar in the 460s ce61 and ravaged the entire region of gandhara destroying its numerous monasteries62 the kanishka stupa was rebuilt during the white hun era with the construction of a tall wooden superstructure built atop a stone base54 and crowned with a 13layer coppergilded chatra54 in the 400s ce the chinese buddhist pilgrim faxian visited the structure and described it as the highest of all the towers in the terrestrial world54 which ancient travelers claimed was up to 560 ft 170 m tall54 though modern estimates suggest a height of 400 ft 120 m54 in 520 ce the chinese monk song yun visited gandhara and ancient peshawar during the white hun era and noted that it was in conflict with nearby kapisa6364 the chinese monk and traveler xuanzang visited ancient peshawar around 630 ce65 after kapisa victory and expressed lament that the city and its great buddhist monuments had decayed to ruin66although some monks studying theravada buddhism continued to study at the monasterys ruins67 xuanzang estimated that only about 1000 families continued in a small quarter among the ruins of the former grand capital62 until the midseventh century the residents of ancient peshawar were ruled by kabul shahis who were then displaced by the hindu shahis of kabul63 islam is believed to have been first introduced to the buddhist hindu and other indigenous inhabitants of puruapura in the later seventh century in 98687 ce peshawars first encounter with muslim armies occurred when sabuktigin invaded the area and fought the hindu shahis under their king anandpal35 on 28 november 1001 sabuktigins son mahmud ghazni decisively defeated the army of raja jayapala son of anandpal at the battle of peshawar68 and established rule of the ghaznavid empire in the peshawar region during the ghaznavid era peshawar served as an important stop between the afghan plateau and the ghaznavid garrison city of lahore35 during the tenth12th century peshawar served as a headquarters for hindu nath panthi yogis55 who in turn are believed to have extensively interacted with muslim sufi mystics55 as the first pashtun tribe to settle in the region the dilazak pashtuns began settling in the valley of peshawar69 and are believed to have settled regions up to the indus river by the 11th century69 the arab historian and geographer almasudi noted that by the mid tenth century the city had become known as parashwar in 117980 muhammad ghori captured peshawar though the city was then destroyed in the early 1200s at the hands of the mongols35 peshawar was an important regional centre under the lodi dynasty of delhi sultanate several other pashtun tribe began settling rural regions around peshawar in the late 15th and 16th centuries70 the ghoryakhel and khashi khel tribe pushed the dilazak pashtun tribes east of the indus river following a battle in 1515 near the city of mardan70 hindko continued to be the language of trade and business in the city64 in july 1526 emperor babur captured peshawar71 during baburs rule the city was known as begram and he rebuilt the citys fort72 babur used the city as a base for expeditions to other nearby towns73 peshawar remained an important centre on trade routes between india and central asia during mughal period the peshawar region was a cosmopolitan region in which goods peoples and ideas would pass along trade routes74 its importance as a trade centre is highlighted by the destruction of over one thousand camelloads of merchandise following an accidental fire at bala hissar fort in 158674 under the reign of baburs son humayun direct mughal rule over the city was briefly challenged with the rise of the pashtun king sher shah suri who began construction of the famous grand trunk road in the 16th century mughal rule in the area was tenuous as mughal suzerainty was only firmly exercised in the peshawar valley while the neighbouring valley of swat was under mughal rule only during the reign of akbar75 peshawar was an important trading centre on the grand trunk road52 during akbars rule the name of the city changed from begram to peshawar35 in 1586 pashtuns rose against mughal rule during the roshani revolt under the leadership of bayazid pir roshan76 founder of the egalitarian roshani movement who assembled pashtun armies in an attempted rebellion against the mughals the roshani followers laid siege to the city until 158776 peshawar was bestowed with its own set of shalimar gardens during the reign of shah jahan77 which

control of the entire area in 167474 following aurangzebs death in 1707 his son bahadur shah i former governor of peshawar and kabul was selected to be the mughal emperor as mughal power declined following the death of emperor aurangzeb the empires defenses were weakened79 on 18 november 1738 peshawar was captured from the mughal governor nawab nasir khan by the afsharid armies during the persian invasion of the mughal empire under nader shah8081 in 1747 peshawar was taken by ahmad shah durrani founder of the afghan durrani empire82 the city was captured in spring of 1758838485 by the maratha confederacy in alliance with the sikhs868788 before that the fort of peshawar was being guarded by durrani troops under timur shah durrani and jahan khan when raghunathrao malhar rao holkar and sikh alliance of charat singh and jassa singh ahluwalia left peshawar tukoji rao holkar was appointed as the representative in this area ofgain the subcontinent898790 in the following year ahmad shah agin occupied the city under the reign of his son timur shah the mughal practice of using kabul as a summer capital and peshawar as a winter capital was reintroduced3591 with the practice maintained until the sikh invasion92 peshawars bala hissar fort served as the residence of afghan kings during their winter stay in peshawar and it was noted to be the main centre of trade between bukhara and india by british explorer william moorcroft during the late 1700s93 peshawar was at the centre of a productive agricultural region that provided much of north indias dried fruit93 timur shahs grandson mahmud shah durrani became king and quickly seized peshawar from his halfbrother shah shuja durrani94 shah shujah was then himself proclaimed king in 1803 and recaptured peshawar while mahmud shah was imprisoned at bala hissar fort until his eventual escape94 in 1809 the british sent an emissary to the court of shah shujah in peshawar marking the first diplomatic meeting between the british and afghans94 his halfbrother mahmud shah then allied himself with the barakzai pashtuns and captured peshawar once again and reigned until the battle of nowshera in march 182394 ranjit singh invaded peshawar in 1818 but handed its rule to peshawar sardars as vassals9596 following the sikh victory against azim khan at the nowshera in march 1823 ranjit singh captured peshawar again and reinstated yar mohammed as the governor9695 by 1830 peshawars economy was noted by scottish explorer alexander burnes to have sharply declined93 with ranjit singhs forces having destroyed the citys palace and agricultural fields93 much of peshawars caravan trade from kabul ceased on account of skirmishes between afghan and sikh forces93 as well as a punitive tax levied on merchants by ranjit singhs forces93 singhs government also required peshawar to forfeit much of its leftover agricultural output to the sikhs as tribute93 while agriculture was further decimated by a collapse of the dried fruit market in north india93 singh appointed neapolitan mercenary paolo avitabile as administrator of peshawar who is remembered for having unleashed a reign of terror his time in peshawar is known as a time of gallows and gibbets the citys famous mahabat khan built in 1630 in the jewelers bazaar was badly damaged and desecrated by the sikh conquerors97 the sikh empire formally annexed peshawar in 1834 following advances from the armies of hari singh nalwa95bringing the city under direct control of the sikh empires lahore durbar95 an 1835 attempt by dost muhammad khan to reoccupy the city was unsuccessful after being unable to breach the peshawar forts defenses98 sikh settlers from punjab were settled in the city during sikh rule the citys only remaining gurdwaras were built by hari singh nalwa to accommodate the newly settled sikhs99 the sikhs also rebuilt the bala hissar fort during their occupation of the city94 following the defeat of the sikhs in the first anglosikh war in 184546 and the second anglosikh war in 1849 some of their territories were captured by the british east india company the british reestablished stability in the wake of ruinous sikh rule93 during the sepoy rebellion of 1857 the 4000 members of the native garrison were disarmed without bloodshed100 the absence of conflict during the rebellion meant that peshawar was not affected by the widespread devastation that was experienced throughout the rest of british india and local chieftains sided with the british after the incident100 the british laid out the vast peshawar cantonment to the west of the city in 1868 and made the city its frontier headquarters101 additionally several projects were initiated in peshawar including linkage of the city by railway to the rest of british india and renovation of the mohabbat khan mosque that had been desecrated by the sikhs97 british suzerainty over regions west of peshawar was cemented in 1893 by sir mortimer durand foreign secretary of the british indian government who collaboratively demarcated the border between british controlled territories in india and afghanistan the british built cunningham clock tower in celebration of the golden jubilee of queen victoria and in 1906 built the victoria hall now home of the peshawar museum in memory of queen victoria97 the british introduced westernstyle education into peshawar with

districts were separated from the punjab province in 1901102 the northwest frontier province was separated from punjab province in 1901 after which peshawar became capital of the new province35

considerable loss of life along with hundreds of looted businesses and injuriesb104 a month prior in february 1910 prominent community religious leaders met with officials and agreed that holi would be solely celebrated in predominantly hindu neighbourhoods of the city notably in andar shehr and karim purac on 21 march 1910 however rumors of musicians from amritsar and a dancing boy from haripur being brought into the city for holi celebrations led to a group of individuals who were marking barawafat into forming a mob with the intention of stopping the processiond despite muslim and hindu community leaders calling for calm both parties ultimately clashed at the asamai gate when the holi procession was en route to dargah pir ratan nath jee with a hindu procession member stabbing a muslim individual in the mobe riots ensued for the following three days involved individuals from outlying tribal regions who had entered the city with a mob at bara bazar allegedly chanting maro hindu ko kill the hindusf estimates detail the riots resulted in a total of 451 damaged shops and homes primarily belonging to members of the hindu community while at least 4 muslims and 6 hindus were killed alongside hundreds of injuries104 peshawar emerged as a centre for both hindkowan and pashtun intellectuals during the british era hindko speakers known as peshoris were responsible for the dominant culture for most of the time that peshawar was under british rule105 peshawar was also home to a nonviolent resistance movement led by ghaffar khan a disciple of mahatma gandhi in april 1930 khan leading a large group of his followers protested in qissa khwani bazaar against discriminatory laws that had been enacted by the colonial government hundreds were killed when a detachment of the british indian army opened fire on the demonstrators106 in 1947 peshawar became part of the newly created state of pakistan and emerged as a cultural centre in the countrys northwest the partition of india saw the departure of many hindkospeaking hindus and sikhs who held key positions in the economy of peshawar weakening the historical presence of hindko language in the city107108109 the university of peshawar was established in the city in 1950 and augmented by the amalgamation of nearby britishera institutions into the university110 until the mid1950s peshawar was enclosed within a city wall and sixteen gates in the 1960s peshawar was a base for a cia operation to spy on the soviet union with the 1960 u2 incident resulting in an aircraft shot down by the soviets that flew from peshawar from the 1960s until the late 1970s peshawar was a major stop on the famous hippie trail111 during the sovietafghan war in the 1980s peshawar served as a political centre for the cia and the interservices intelligencetrained mujahideen groups based in the camps of afghan refugees it also served as the primary destination for large numbers of afghan refugees by 1980 100000 refugees a month were entering the province112 with 25 of all refugees living in peshawar district in 1981112 the arrival of large numbers of afghan refugees strained peshawars infrastructure113 and drastically altered the citys demography113 like much of northwest pakistan peshawar has been severely affected by violence from the attacks by the terrorist group tehrikitaliban local poets shrines have been targeted by the pakistani taliban114 a suicide bomb attack targeted the historic all saints church in 2013 and most notably the 2014 peshawar school massacre in which taliban militants killed 132

walled city as well as a royal citadel122 historically the old city of peshawar was a heavily guarded citadel that consisted of high walls in the 21st century only remnants of the walls remain but the houses and havelis continue to be structures of significance most of the houses are constructed of unbaked bricks with the incorporation of wooden structures for protection against earthquakes with many composed of wooden doors and latticed wooden balconies numerous examples of the citys old architecture can still be seen in areas such as sethi mohallah in the old city located in innerpeshawar many historic monuments and bazaars exist in the 21st century including the mohabbat khan mosque kotla mohsin khan chowk yadgar and the qissa khawani bazaar due to the damage caused by rapid growth and development the old walled city has been identified as an area that urgently requires restoration and protection123 the walled city was surrounded by several main gates that served as the main entry points into the city in january 2012 an announcement was made that the government plans to address the damage that has left the gates largely nonexistent over time with all of the gates targeted for restoration124 according to the 2023 census peshawar was the 8th largest city of pakistan134 and the largest city in khyber pakhtunkhwa with a population of 1905975135 its population is five times higher than the secondlargest city in the province peshawar has hosted afghan refugees since the start of the afghan civil war in 1978 though the rate of migration drastically increased following the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 the arrival of large numbers of afghan refugees strained peshawars infrastructure113 and drastically altered the citys demography113 during the 1988 national elections an estimated 100000 afghans refugees were illegally registered to vote in peshawar136 in 2012 it was estimated that afghans constituted 28 of the citys total population and that the numbers

have established successful businesses in peshawar and play an important role in the citys economy140 peshawaris also known as peshoris are the hindkospeaking urban community which has inhabited the city since the ancient period18 mostly associated with trade business and education peshoris formed majority in the city until the 1960s141 today they are a minority ethnic group mostly confined to

religious group with around 20000 adherents while over 7000 members of the ahmadiyya community live in peshawar147 hindus and sikhs are also found in the city though most of the citys hindu and sikh community migrated en masse to india following the partition of british india in 1947 though the citys sikh population drastically declined after partition the sikh community has been bolstered in peshawar by the arrival of approximately 4000 sikh refugees from conflict in the federally administered tribal areas148 in 2008 the largest sikh population in pakistan was located in peshawar149 sikhs in peshawar selfidentify as pashtuns and speak pashto as their mother tongue150 there was a small but thriving jewish community until the late 1940s after the partition and the emergence of the state of israel jews left for israel151 peshawars economic importance has historically been linked to its privileged position at the entrance to the khyber pass the ancient travel route by which most trade between central asia and the indian subcontinent passed peshawars economy also benefited from tourism in the mid20th century as the city formed a crucial part of the hippie trail peshawars estimated monthly per capita income was 55246 in 2015 compared to 117924 in islamabad115 and 66359 in karachi115 peshawars surrounding region is also relatively poor khyber pakhtunkhwas cities on average have

widespread islamist violence in 2007 wages rose only 15 between 2008 and 2014 real wages dropped for some skilled craftsmen during the period between 2008 and 2014115 peshawars economy has been negatively impacted by political instability since 1979 resulting from the war in afghanistan and subsequent strain on peshawars infrastructure from the influx of refugees140 the poor security environment resulting from islamist violence also impacted the citys economy with the launch of operation zarbeazb in 2014 the countrys security environment has drastically improved162 the
